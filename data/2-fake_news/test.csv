2075,Las Vegas shooting: Police in major switch of timeline,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption The attack, carried out from the Mandalay Bay hotel, killed 58 people
The gunman behind last week's Las Vegas massacre shot a security guard six minutes before the attack, police say, in a striking change to the timeline.
Police initially said the guard interrupted Stephen Paddock as the attack was under way.
The revelation raises questions as to why police did not pinpoint Paddock's location sooner.
But the Mandalay Bay hotel, where the massacre unfolded, questioned the new sequence of events.
""We cannot be certain about the most recent timeline,"" said Debra DeShong, a spokeswoman for MGM Resorts International, late on Tuesday.
""We believe what is currently being expressed may not be accurate.""
The attack left 58 people dead and was the worst in modern US history.
Security guard Jesus Campos was at first credited by authorities with distracting the gunman from killing more people.
But on Monday police revised their account of events to clarify that Mr Campos was shot in the leg and wounded at 21:59.
They said Paddock, who had placed security cameras outside his room, shot Mr Campos through the door of his suite, firing 200 rounds into the hallway.

According to police, the guard was investigating an alarm that went off in another room on the same floor when he heard a drilling sound from Paddock's room.
The gunman inserted spy cameras into the peep hole on the door of his suite, police have previously said.
Clark County Sheriff Joseph Lombardo also amended the date on which police believe Paddock checked into Mandalay Bay.

They initially said he had checked in on 28 September, three days before the shooting.
They now say he checked in on 25 September.
Paddock sprayed gunfire from the upper floors of the Mandalay Bay hotel on to a concert attended by thousands of people.
'Some things were bound to change'
Sheriff Lombardo said that police did not realise that the security guard had been shot until they arrived on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel.
That was the case even though the guard managed to alert the hotel's security team.
Mr Lombardo said new information had emerged during the investigation and that ""some things were bound to change"" given its complicated nature.
Police also say that the gunman, 64, was seen on numerous occasions in Las Vegas gambling heavily by himself the night before the shooting, which ended with him killing himself.
Paddock was dead by the time officers entered the room and it is not known why he had stopped shooting.
""This individual purposely hid his actions leading up to this event, and it is difficult for us to find the answers,"" Mr Lombardo told a news conference. Paddock's motives remain unclear.
Extensive research into the gunman's mental state found no explanation for such a violent turn of events, police say.
It is suspected Paddock scouted out other locations near open-air concerts in the weeks before the Las Vegas attack.",fake

3863,Brazil's Nuzman steps way from Olympics committee after his arrest,"SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Carlos Arthur Nuzman, head of Brazil’s Olympics committee, has decided to step away from the games’ governing body after he was arrested last week for allegedly conspiring to rig the election of the city hosting the 2016 games, according to a statement by the National Olympics Committee on Saturday.
The decision to take leave was expressed in a letter to be shown to the members of COB, as the body is known, during an extraordinary general assembly slated to take place Oct. 11, the statement said.
The move comes after Brazilian police arrested Nuzman on Thursday, accusing him of arranging more than $2 million in bribes to get the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to pick Rio de Janeiro as host of the 2016 games.
Nuzman denied any wrongdoing and said his leave of absence will last the time necessary to prove his innocence.
Nuzman, 75, was taken into custody along with a former director of the national Olympics committee. Both men face allegations including corruption and money laundering.",fake

1495,"The story of rugby's injury crisis from the players, a coach and a doctor","Ugo Monye is taken off the pitch on a stretcher during the Six Nations in 2010
Listen again to ""Rugby Union: An Injury Crisis?"" - the full programme
The statistics have been piling up at the start of this rugby season: 10 of the 12 Premiership clubs suffering a combined 82 injuries to first-team players; one of them, Wasps, beginning October with 15 players out injured; Pro14 side Dragons going into this weekend with 24 players on the sick list.
It may turn out to be a freakish blip, a cruel upsurge in a sport where the number of professional players injured has been relatively static over the past eight years. The Rugby Football Union's annual injury audit in the new year should tell us more.
For now, for those on the front line, it is about more than numbers. This is the story from those living through it: the coach missing half his team, the international player who wakes up in pain but keeps coming back for more, the rugby obsessive forced to retire young, the doctor who tries to patch them up and keep them going.
All still cherish the sport. None are complaining. If it sounds like a strange type of love affair, this is how it works. And hurts.
The player who keeps going: 'I'd never say you're 100% fresh'
Dan Cole has won 74 caps for England and been on two Lions tours
Tight-head prop Dan Cole has been capped 74 times for England, been on two British and Irish Lions tours and made more than 200 club appearances for Leicester Tigers and Bedford Blues.
He is a man who relishes the brutal forces and challenges of playing in the front row, a stoic who missed most of 2014 with a neck injury that left him with no power in his left arm but has come back to keep playing past his 30th birthday. What follows is neither a grumble nor hyperbole.
""You struggle to get a good night's sleep after a game on a Saturday afternoon because your ear's hanging off or your shoulders hurt. You get to three o'clock on a Sunday and you start feeling worse. Normally Monday is the worst day for stiffness, tiredness, pain,"" said the 30-year-old.
""What hurts most depends which way you've been lying, but usually you'll have a stiff neck or a stiff shoulder. You're creaky in your lower limbs, but you still get going. You have to get going. Usually by Thursday you're close to 95%. I'd never say you're 100% fresh.
""The pain bonds you as a team. You learn about each other in the tough times, whether that's the physical tough times or the mental ones, the emotional times. From that you get a deeper learning of each other, a deeper trust of each other.
""I do think about what it will be like when I'm 50 or 60. We were laughing in the dressing room today about what our reunion in 30 years' time will look like.
""It's a harder game now than when I started. It's physically tougher. There are more collisions, the skill level is higher, the conditioning is higher.
""To us it's all worth it, because we love what we do. You accept how you're going to be because you've enjoyed what you do. You prefer that to sitting at a desk for 50 years.
""My grandfather worked down a coal mine. The seam collapsed on him and he broke his back. He was left injured by his job and I will possibly have the same consequences. But I enjoy my job a lot more than he enjoyed his, so it's a pay-off.
""The big one you fear is a spinal injury. Everything else in your career, touch wood, whether it's knee ligaments or shoulders, surgery and medicine are so good that they can fix that in six or nine months. Spines, brains, the neural stuff - those are the ones you don't wish on anyone.
""There are times when you get rolled up at the bottom of things, or when you're clearing someone out of a breakdown and maybe your foot gets trapped and you're rolled back, or you're over the ball and you think, 'uh-oh'. There's a moment when you know for a flash second that you could be in trouble.
""Then your foot springs loose, it's over and you dust yourself off and you get on with it. You get two or maybe more a season like that when you think, 'I'm glad I came out of that unharmed'. You check yourself over and then you run off, because there's something else to be done.
""You accept it as part of the game. If you dwell on it, it will affect you for longer, and you'll probably expose yourself more to those sort of things. It's like if you go on an advanced driving course and you're told that if you're skidding out of control and you look at the crash, you're going to go into it, but if you look away from it you'll be OK.""
The career cut short: 'It's like a big anvil being dropped on you'
Will Fraser was forced off with a head injury against Munster in 2014
The relentlessly positive Will Fraser won the European Cup and Premiership double with Saracens, and after being called into the England squad as a 23-year-old, appeared set for a long and successful career.
Instead, after a series of injuries - including tearing a tendon off the bone in his shoulder, damaging knee ligaments, a slipped disc, a bleed on the spine - and 10 subsequent operations, he went to his surgeon in April this year to receive his final diagnosis. He does not regret anything that happened to him.
""I had become best mates with all these consultants who were experts in different areas of the anatomy. There was a pub round the corner from the surgeon's office, so me and my physio had a pint to discuss various outcomes,"" said the 27-year-old.
""We went in to the surgeon, and he said what he said. It's the realisation, but at the same time you're fighting every urge to accept it. Even though in the back of my mind I probably knew, I was still trying to fight it.
""It's not really until you're given that black and white news by someone else, because if it was up to me I'd still be giving it a go. To have a surgeon, a top-of-his-game surgeon, say to you, 'This isn't going to get better, it's time to call it a day,' is like a big anvil being dropped on top of you.
""We went back to the pub, had a few more pints, and I didn't really say very much. It was just my physio being a good bloke and telling me there were better things coming in my life. Then I went home and basically broke down in front of my missus.
""No-one else among the Saracens players really knew the gravity of where we were. I had purposely tried to keep it away from the lads as much as possible, because we're a very tight group.
""I even kept it away from my super-close friends like Jamie George, Owen Farrell, Jackson Wray and George Kruis, because I didn't want them to worry. These are guys I've grown up with, who I've seen every day since I was 14.
""For a week or two it was all very surreal. I was still in and around the club for a couple of weeks, having to keep it secret from my team-mates. When I finally told the team I was genuinely worried I wouldn't be able to get any words out. I was blubbering away. Waterfalls streaming down my face.
""I just wanted to thank them. People have always asked me, with the injuries, 'how are you able to come into training with a smile on your face when you're not playing'? And I said to the boys, 'the reason I was able to do that is because I was coming in to see you guys'. I'm doing something I love, with people that I love.
""I pop down to the training ground once a week to get my fix of seeing the lads and getting some banter thrown my way for my work bag. And it's like I've never left, which is obviously brilliant, and exactly how you want it to be. But equally they then go out and train, and I'm inside sending some emails, and it hits home every time that you're not doing it.""
The coach missing half his squad: 'A crisis in the sport at the moment'
Wasps were without an entire XV - including fly-half Danny Cipriani - because of injury
Bernard Jackman is the genial head coach of Dragons. He currently has 24 players out injured, which equates to 48% of his squad.
He is also a former hooker for Leinster and Ireland.
A three-year medical study in France found that hookers are more likely to be injured than any other position, suffering more face, neck and knee injuries than anyone else on the team.
""There seems to be a crisis in the sport at the moment, and it's not just our club. It seems to be getting worse,"" said the Irishman.
""The most important meeting of the week for me is the Monday morning one, when you get the assessment of what happened in the weekend's game from your medical staff and who is likely to be available for the weekend. I've started dreading those meetings now.
""It affects the quality we can train at. We're looking to create a style of play, and if the opposition in training aren't of the quality we're going to get on Saturday, it gives you a false sense of confidence. We don't get tested enough. The ball isn't in play enough when we do our defensive systems.
""I plan now that for any given match I'm going to be missing about 30% of my players. Most coaches are facing that at the moment. I think 20% missing would be decent at the moment. You'd be happy with that. Nobody's escaping from this.
""My own knees are shot. I'm not great first thing in the morning; my knees do get very sore if I'm on my feet for long. But I wouldn't change any of it. I'm still doing my passion.
""For 21 years I have been a professional player or coach, and I'm still loving it. Hookers carry quite a bit of ball; defensively you're making more tackles, trying to catch up with the flankers. But it's a great position to play - if my son wanted to play hooker, I certainly wouldn't try to talk him out of it.
""I was never worried about the future. It's great at the time, and it's always short-term. Can I play this week? Can I play next week? You worry about post-playing afterwards. And if you don't have that attitude you won't have a long career.
""Jamie Roberts [Harlequins centre] said the only time you're not injured is your first game, and I think that's right; there's very rarely a day when you're not hurt, and you just crack on.
""For the vast majority of injuries you can train and play. For sure there are days they can't get out of bed, but as you warm up and the day gets longer and you get the adrenaline into your body, you can play through that.
""It's the love of the game. It's the competitiveness. It's the sense of teamship. A job to do to represent your club, your region, your country, your family in a positive way. That 80 minutes on a Saturday gives you back more than the pain takes away during the week.
""That feeling of emptying yourself over 60 or 80 minutes brings contentment. There's nothing like it. There is something cleansing about it, something wholesome.""
The doctor on the front line: 'Very few are playing injury free'
French club Pau stood down former All Black Colin Slade after he suffered three concussions last season
Highly regarded sports doctor Eanna Falvey was head of medical for the British and Irish Lions this summer, having been team doctor to the Irish rugby team for many years and Munster before that.
A former Irish amateur heavyweight champion, he understands both the physical pain of elite sport and its addiction.
""It's a harsh reality, but very few players are playing injury free at any given point in time. Anything from a slight muscle strain to tightness in a joint to aggravation of an old injury,"" he said.
""Sometimes it can be difficult - if a player has a cruciate ligament repair, we'll generally see within four or five years that they'll have some degenerative change within the joint. A player will be managing but over time their knee will be getting sore - not acute, but regularly bothering them.
""It becomes a case of managing pain, but you have to avoid the quick fix of them coming to you for pain relief. That's very rarely a good idea. All you're doing is glossing over the underlying issue.
""During matches at the 2011 World Cup, the time for the doctor to run out, make contact with the player and make an assessment - you're talking 30 seconds maximum.
""There's a very rudimentary assessment where you ask the player five questions. I can say as a team physician I never got through the five questions without being interrupted by something or someone while I was trying to do it. I would have argued that that's not a long enough time to even decide if you're worried about somebody.
""You're trying to make an assessment with 80,000 screaming supporters, you're probably cold and wet, there are five minutes left in the game, your team is just about to win or lose - these are all things that shouldn't make a difference but they do.
""When the pressure is on, that can be a lonely place to be. Most pitches have a significant camber. So if you're on one touchline you often can't see the feet of players on the other side of the pitch. There is so much going on at any one time that you spend the whole match watching who does get up and who doesn't get up rather than what's happening in the match.
""I remember being with Ireland in Rome, and [ex-Ireland wing] Luke Fitzgerald called me over. He'd felt a little shudder in his knee. He had actually ruptured his cruciate. He was standing up, he was trying to jog around. To him it just felt a little wobbly, a bit unusual. You couldn't have chosen a more benign cause, but it was a devastating injury.
""It can be hard. You become reasonably friendly with these players. I teach a masters in sports medicine to doctors and physios, and one of the things I teach them is that you can't afford to be a fan.
""You can't afford to be emotionally invested in the outcome of either the team or the player's input on the team. You need to look after the player as a human being rather than part of the team.""
During two games for his new club Leicester this season, George Ford - often the smallest man on the pitch - made a combined 29 tackles. He has made 63 in all after six Premiership matches - the most by any back
The aftermath: 'Bending over to get into the bath is a genuine struggle'
Ugo Monye made more than 200 appearances for Harlequins on the wing, as well as winning 14 caps for England and two for the Lions.
Now part of BBC Radio 5 live's Rugby Union Weekly Podcast, he is a little less flexible than he used to be.
""Every morning I get up, walk down the stairs and I struggle. It takes me 20 to 30 minutes to warm up my Achilles.
""I'm 34. I had a groin reconstruction about four or five years ago. I've got tendonitis in both my Achilles. I've got three prolapsed discs in my spine.
""We've got a new baby at home. My paternal duty is bathing Phoenix. Bending over to get into the bath is a genuine struggle. I can't actually bend over to pick her up.
""And this is coming from a winger. I wasn't a number eight who had the huge collisions and competed at the ruck.""",fake

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Co-chairman Harvey Weinstein was taking an indefinite leave from the Weinstein Co, the film production company said on Friday, adding it will conduct an internal investigation into the New York Times’ report of sexual harassment allegations against one of the most powerful men in Hollywood.
The Weinstein Company board of representatives said in a statement that it takes “extremely seriously” the accusations made in the Times story that said Weinstein had made eight settlements with women who had accused him of unwanted physical contact and sexual harassment over three decades.
Meanwhile, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and several Democratic politicians including Senators Kamala Harris, Cory Booker and Chuck Schumer said Friday they will re-route Weinstein’s political donations to women’s rights groups.
Weinstein Co board representatives called it “essential” to company culture “that all women who work for it or have any dealings with it or any of our executives are treated with respect and have no experience of harassment or discrimination.”
The company said it has retained an outside legal firm to conduct an independent investigation into the allegations.

Weinstein, 65, will take an indefinite leave of absence, the company said. His brother Bob, a co-chairman, and chief operating officer David Glasser will lead the company.
“As Harvey has said, it is important for him to get professional help for the problems he has acknowledged. Next steps will depend on Harvey’s therapeutic progress, the outcome of the Board’s independent investigation, and Harvey’s own personal decisions,” the board representatives added.
Weinstein initially responded to the Times story on Thursday by apologizing for causing anyone pain, and saying he was taking a leave of absence.
His lawyer later threatened to sue the New York Times.
Weinstein, one of Hollywood’s best-known figures, has produced or distributed Oscar-winning movies including “Shakespeare in Love” and “Chicago.” He was a prominent donor to Democrats during the 2016 general election campaign.
“The DNC will donate over $30,000 in contributions from Weinstein to EMILY’s List, Emerge America and Higher Heights because what we need is more women in power,” DNC communications director Xochitl Hinojosa said in a statement.",fake
1286,Analysts raise EU carbon price forecasts on expectations of market reform: survey,"LONDON (Reuters) - Analysts have raised their forecasts for European carbon prices in the bloc’s Emission Trading System (ETS) to 2019 on expectations that plans to reform the market will significantly curb oversupply.
Analysts expect EU Allowances (EUAs) to average 7.16 euros/ton in 2018, and 9.92 euros/ton in 2019, according to the survey of seven analysts by Reuters published on Wednesday.
The forecasts were up 19 percent and 16 percent, respectively, on prices given in July, of 6.01 euros for 2018 and 8.54 euros for 2019.
Analysts also for the first time gave average price forecasts for 2020, which at 14.70 euros are almost double current traded prices around 7.40 euros/ton.
The European Union’s ETS, a cap-and-trade permit system to regulate industry pollution, has suffered from excess supply since the financial crisis.
As part of the process to fix the scheme European lawmakers are working on reforms, and plan to double the rate at which the so-called Market Stability Reserve (MSR) -- a measure designed to remove from the market surplus permits which have depressed prices -- soaks up excess allowances.
“The MSR will considerably reduce auction supply in 2019 and this should have a strong bullish effect on market prices, putting more pressure on utilities to find EUAs for compliance,” said Sandrine Ferrand, analyst at Engie Global Markets.
In the shorter term analysts lifted their average price forecasts for Q4 2017 by 26 percent to 6.82 euros/ton on expectations that prolonged outages to French nuclear plants could lift EUA demand from fossil-fuel power generators in neighboring countries which usually import power from France.
After several delays in the restart of some of France’s nuclear reactors following maintenance and a review ordered by the nuclear watchdog, 21 out of France’s 58 nuclear reactors are offline.
“The French nuclear fleet is a joker (in the pack), as it is uncertain whether the security probes will extend the planned outages, thus providing further support to power and carbon,” said Haege Fjellheim, head of carbon market analysis at Thomson Reuters.",fake
752,Smart Meters Create A “Honeypot” Of Personal Information To Exploit,"By Catherine J. Frompovich
Over a year ago, reporter Ruth Lyle of the UK’s Daily Mail, published a rather introspective article about how AMI Smart Meters will be used to spy on British households and the ramifications of that totalitarian-like practice.
In reading Lyle’s article, I could not help but wonder if U.S. consumers are aware of what’s going on with AMI Smart Meters in the USA, because surveillance is part and parcel of the ‘new energy saving’ crisis!
According to Lyle,
A Mail investigation has discovered how marketing firms are targeting data collected by smart meters, which reveal how customers use their gas and electricity, and hoping to turn the information they provide in to a steady stream of cash . [CJF emphasis]
The above statement should be most disconcerting for utility customers everywhere, just not in the UK! Utility companies plan to mine and sell customers’ usage data and to profit off of that data, which belongs to customers and often without customers’ knowledge and/or consent to relinquish/sell their data to unknown third parties. How does that reality sit with you, the consumer?
According to Lyle, “Firms must ask customers’ permission before examining in depth data or selling it on to third parties,” at least in Great Britain. How about in the USA? If you have a newly retrofitted AMI Smart Meter on your electric, natural gas or water utility services in the USA, have you been asked by your utility company to sign a consent form to collect and sell your intimate personal usage data to unknown third parties? Furthermore, have those utilities agreed to give you a commission or rebate on your utility bill for providing such “monetarily-and-profit-valuable” sales leads from which they anticipate earning megabucks ?
Lyle points out what AMI Smart Meters are all about when she says,
Experts say firms are eying up the steady stream of data that the devices provide about customers’ lifestyles as a way of making a profit . [CJF emphasis]
The above is most outrageous, since in the USA at least, utilities received federal grants of around $200 MILLION each to roll out AMI Smart Meters. That wasn’t enough for them, undoubtedly. Do you know utilities will be able to jack up the usage rates when there’s high consumer utility use? To this writer’s mind, that sounds like chutzpah, greed and outright thievery. “Pitney Bowes describes smart meters as a ‘once in a generation business opportunity for energy providers’.”
A spokesman for SmartEnergy, UK, said
Consumers own their own data and the decision about whether this can be shared with third parties rests soley [sic] with them. No sales can take place during a smart meter installation visit. If energy suppliers wish to undertake marketing at the installation consent from the customer has to be obtained prior to the appointment. [CJF emphasis]
That may apply in the UK, but don’t count on owning your data in the USA and being asked to sign a consent form. Please refer to my article “Smart Meter Data: Privacy and Cybersecurity – Congressional Research Report 2012,” which addresses many serious—even Constitutional issues—revolving around consumers’ AMI Smart Meter data; utilities selling it for profit without customers’ knowledge; spying on households to collect that coveted data; and numerous U.S. statutes no public utility commission is paying attention to—and, obviously, are in violation of—when mandating AMI Smart Meter implementation, or else termination of one’s utility service(s).
Isn’t it time for class action lawsuits against utility companies and states public utility commissions regarding the collection and selling of customers’ personal data either with or without our consent and knowledge?
What role does the ‘new’ 5G microwave planned rollout play in issues involving the ‘smart’ meme, artificial intelligence, a total surveillance society, and health safety?
First and foremost, no health and environmental impact studies have been performed on the generational (“G”) microwave platforms that have been rolled out. “Safety” is based upon consensus science proffered by ICNIRP, the professional association that does not accept the fact there are non-thermal radiation waves, which adversely affect humans (electromagnetic hypersensitivity and cancers), the environment and all life forms, when 32% of microwave industry studies ACTUALLY FOUND AND CONFIRMED NON-THERMAL EFFECTS!
The only issue some seemingly are concerned about is the esthetics of how those newly-proposed mini-microwave towers (aka “thimble” towers [4]) will look every so many feet when placed on city streets and landscapes. One particular city which has taken note, and much to their credit, is Tampa, Florida.
According to Richard Danielson of the Tampa Bay Times,
TAMPA — The City Council on Thursday moved ahead with proposals to minimize the visual clutter created on city streets by the next generation of wireless antennas, many as small as a pizza box, but some as big as a family-sized refrigerator. [CJF emphasis] “There’s a lot of people who don’t understand what this means (for) the right of way near their homes,” council member Mike Suarez said. “There are going to be some very significant changes to the way your neighborhood looks based on this particular ordinance.” Among the restrictions on the city: If a city pole cannot accommodate one of the new antennas, the city has to replace the pole at its cost. The city has to allow the installation of new poles. The city cannot impose a distance separation between the new antennas and related equipment. The city cannot prohibit the antennas, except in very limited areas. That’s because the antennas tend to be smaller, but wireless companies need a lot more of them to create good networks. So instead of big cell towers up to 250 feet tall, the industry is expected to turn to antennas mounted on many more existing or new utility poles. [which means they can be placed right outside your front door or bedroom window blasting 5G microwaves into you, your household and ambient environment, with no health safety aspects or provisions considered, nor implemented!]
What I find extremely troubling about the entire ‘smart’ meme issues includes:
1 – Consumers have become totally enthralled and even addicted to their smart gadgets, which are harming their health from microwave radiation. What don’t you folks get? You’ve been sold a bill of goods—just like the tobacco industry promoted cigarettes even to the point of having medical doctors advertising them [1]—and, unknowingly and unwittingly, have become a contributing part of the EMF problem for relying upon, using and clamoring for faster Wi-Fi plus other harmful electromagnetic frequency gadgets. 2 – Consumers are lax in realizing that giving and/or subjecting microwave tech appliances and gadgets to children are harming them, especially their developmental capacities since microwaves adversely affect kids’ smaller bodies, especially their brains! Sources: here and here 3 – Consumers don’t recognize nor realize that anything “smart” is part of the ultimate United Nations’ goal of a total global surveillance society [2, 3]. Welcome to a worldwide gulag!
It’s still not too late to rethink the microwave problems, especially about health issues, that deliberately have been kept from consumers similar to what was done about asbestos, tobacco and cigarette use, antibiotics and the current opioid drug problems, GMO ‘phoods’ not being labeled and literally forced down our throats without consumers knowing nor having a choice via truth in advertising labels, and the infamous clandestine skullduggery that brought it all about as so ‘eloquently’ stated by the late David Rockefeller:
FREE Stormproof, Waterproof Survival Match Kit (Ad) We are grateful to the Washington Post, The New York Times, Time Magazine and other publications whose directors have attended our meetings and respected their promises of discretion for almost forty years. It would have been impossible for us to develop our plan for the world if we had been subject to the bright lights of publicity during those years. But the world is now more sophisticated and prepared to march toward a world government. . . . The supranational sovereignty of an intellectual elite and world bankers is surely preferable to the national auto-determination practiced in past centuries . (source) [CJF emphasis]
Readers will note the source for that now-infamous Rockefeller statement made at the 1991 Bilderberg meeting in Baden, Germany, is a video, which conveniently has been sanitized from the Internet.
The collusion on the part of the U.S. media and others is confirmed. Whom will consumers believe? Need I say any more?

2332,"In Hong Kong, It’s the Fans Who Protest During the National Anthem","Now the authorities are planning tougher measures. Last month, China’s legislature approved a law prohibiting disrespect of the anthem, barring the song’s use in commercials or parodies, and outlining punishments for people who do not “stand with respect” and “maintain a dignified bearing” when it is played.
Weekslong street protests in Hong Kong known as the Umbrella Movement ended three years ago without the government ceding any ground on expanding residents’ say in local elections.
But that spirit of protest has been revived in the stadium jeers, which appear to have started two years ago. Hong Kong played China in World Cup qualifiers twice in 2015, and those matches took on an added political dimension coming a year after the street protests.
Photo
With a population of seven million, Hong Kong is a minnow in the ocean of international soccer. But the city has a long history with the sport and, with the help of some foreign-born players, often punches above its weight.
China has a huge population to draw from and its teams have been successful in several sports. But its men’s soccer teams have routinely struggled in international competition.
In 1985, Hong Kong beat China, 2-1, in Beijing to eliminate the team from qualifying for the following year’s World Cup, setting off a riot. In the 2015 World Cup qualifiers, Hong Kong tied China twice. To add to the insult, the home fans booed the Chinese national anthem before the game in Hong Kong.
The world governing body for soccer, FIFA, fined the Hong Kong Football Association for fans booing during one of the China matches and also during a 2015 World Cup qualifier against Qatar. The city’s football association has called on fans to behave, and stewards make vain attempts to encourage hard-core supporters to keep quiet during the national anthem.

The anthem, “March of the Volunteers,” was a poem set to music in 1935, and it became popular as a call for resistance against Japan. Its lyricist, Tian Han, died in prison during the Cultural Revolution in 1968.
The anthem law went into effect on Oct. 1. But Hong Kong, a former British colony, maintains a semiautonomous existence that allows it to keep its own economic and legal systems. So Hong Kong will need to enact its own version of the law, which it has yet to do.

Thus far, Hong Kong fans are unbowed.
“We do it spontaneously because we don’t think we are part of the P.R.C.,” said Sanho Chung, 24, who was at Tuesday’s game, using an abbreviation for the People’s Republic of China. “We are different.”
Rights activists and pro-democracy politicians are concerned that the law could be used to suppress free expression.
“I think it will be quite problematic to apply it,” said Dennis Kwok, a member of Hong Kong’s Legislative Council.
Photo
He noted that the mainland law allows the police to place violators in administrative detention for 15 days. That method of incarceration, which bypasses the courts, does not exist in Hong Kong.
And the idea of showing reverence will be hard to define, he said. “What does it mean to be respectful of the national anthem?” Mr. Kwok said. “That concept of law is simply unheard-of here, to have to stand in silence. I think we need to be very careful defining what is respectful and what is not.”
Hong Kong officials say the national anthem law is a routine matter that should not prompt concern among residents.
“I just want to reiterate that, rightly so, we are living in a more politicized environment, but we need not adopt this very politicized stance in considering and dealing with any matter,” Carrie Lam, the chief executive of Hong Kong, said in August. “This particular matter of national anthem legislation does not carry any particular scope for politicization.”

In recent months, the authorities have taken several steps to punish people for protesting or for calling for Hong Kong’s independence. Now, even symbolic protests are being suppressed.
Last month, a lawmaker was fined 5,000 Hong Kong dollars, about $640, for turning upside down several small Hong Kong and Chinese flags on desks in the Legislative Council chamber.
And the appearance of posters calling for Hong Kong independence on a wall run by the student union at the Chinese University of Hong Kong set off debate between local and mainland students. School administrators and Hong Kong officials called the signs illegal, but legal scholars said it was questionable whether colonial-era sedition laws could be enforced.
“The introduction of a national anthem law is coming at a time when people who oppose symbols of the Chinese government and symbols of the Chinese Communist Party have reason to fear they could end up behind bars,” said Maya Wang, senior China researcher for Human Rights Watch. “This could have a chilling effect on freedom of expression.”
On Tuesday at the match against Malaysia, Mr. Chung, clad in a red home jersey, stood with fellow fans during halftime. He said the national anthem law would not stop him from booing.
“It does dampen our freedom of speech, forcing us to respect something,” he said. “I worry, but I will still practice my rights. I think this is my right.”",fake
1823,Judicial Reform Activist and Attorney Abducted by Police While Broadcasting,"By Janet Phelan
Judicial reform activist and radio personality Andy Ostrowski has been taken into custody against his will and forced into a psychiatric evaluation. His abduction took place yesterday, September 19, at approximately 3 pm in Wilkes-Barre, PA, where Ostrowski resides.
Ostrowski was taken while on Facebook live and the incident was captured on video. The video is available here:
https://www.youtube.com/watch? v=Ig_YZ1BgiYw&feature=youtu.be
The video reveals an obviously anxious Ostrowski stating he had just seen a Wilkes-Barre police officer climbing over his fence. He says, “I am staying on Facebook live here til someone pulls me off the air.”
“Andy Ostrowski has done nothing wrong to anyone,” he says on the video.” Andy Ostrowski has done nothing but hit enter on emails and things on Facebook.” At that juncture, Ostrowski suddenly stated that two police officers had just entered his house, wearing gloves and carrying tasers In the background, one can hear the officers ordering him to stand up while he repeatedly asks for to see the warrant. One then hears the off-camera officer saying he has a warrant to take him into custody for a mental health evaluation. The camera then goes dark.
Ostrowski was reached a couple hours later at the General Hospital crisis unit. According to Ostrowski, he was not shown a valid, signed warrant for his detention. He discussed the history of the efforts in Wilkes-Barre to deprive him of his freedom, stating that he was being held as a political prisoner.
In a wide ranging conversation, he talked about his career as a civil rights attorney and how his efforts to impact racial discrimination very likely got him suspended from the practice of law, in 2010. “I was representing minority business contractors,” he stated, “and their bids, which were really good, were being systematically rejected.” The lawsuits he filed put him in direct opposition with Pennsylvania Governor Tom Ridge, who later became Director of the Department of Homeland Security.
Speaking of what he uncovered as a racial agenda, Ostrowski said, “We are looking at world domination by white men.”
Ostrowski previously hosted a radio show on Twigs Cafe, which discussed issues surrounding legal corruption. He recently made what he termed a “Declaration of Independence” from the United States, which he states is occupied by a foreign power. In July of this year, he filed a federal lawsuit naming the “American System of Justice” as a primary defendant.
Ostrowski had teamed up with noted civil rights attorney Don Bailey, whose battle for his law license got national press coverage. Bailey, a former Pennsylvania Congressman, was disbarred by the US Supreme Court in 2014 for making statements that judges were corrupt, among other accusations of legal corruption. Ostrowski recalls that he was told that “They wanted me out of the way so I couldn’t help Bailey.”
From his hospital confinement today, Ostrowski appeared emotional but lucid. “They don’t have the balls to give me due process or charge me with a crime,” he asserted, “so they are going for mental health imprisonment.”
“I am never backing down on a word I have said,” he stated.
According to Ostrowski, he was detained twice previously this year for an evaluation and was told by the assigned psychiatrist that “Next time, we are putting you into a state institution.”
Ostrowski will be evaluated by the crisis team and can be held for 72 hours. At that time, if he is still considered a “threat to himself or others,” he can be detained for a month. Pennsylvania law guarantees a hearing after the 72 hour hold expires and, should he be further detained, after the 30 days.
Wilkes Barre is located in Luzerne County, the locus of the infamous “Kids for Cash” judicial scandal.

2770,"Y.A. Tittle, Quarterback Who Led Giants to 3 Title Games, Dies at 90","“He was somebody who had come from somewhere else, who’d been gotten rid of, and a lot of New Yorkers can identify with that.”
Though he was the first to admit that he didn’t look the part — “I’ve been old and baldheaded and ugly since I’ve been 28,” he reflected long afterward — Tittle became a marquee figure with the Giants and one of their most popular players. The Giants’ radio station played the novelty song “I’m in Love With Y. A. Tittle,” and when Tittle connected on long passes, Yankee Stadium reverberated to chants of “Y. A., Y. A.”
Tittle led the Giants to Eastern Conference titles in 1961, ’62 and ’63, though they were beaten each time in the N.F.L. title game.
Photo
He threw for 242 touchdowns and 33,070 yards in his 17 years as a pro, and his 36 touchdown passes in 1963 set a record that stood for 21 years. He was named the league’s most valuable player in 1963 in an Associated Press poll and elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1971.
The end for Tittle as one of football’s best and most resilient quarterbacks essentially came in Pittsburgh on Sept. 20, 1964, in his 17th bruising year in the pros, when a massive lineman slammed him to the ground in a game that Tittle’s Giants lost to the Steelers.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Slowly, Tittle tried to pull himself up off the turf, woozy from a concussion, and Morris Berman, a photographer for The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, was there to snap the picture: Tittle kneeling, his shoulders drooped, his helmet knocked off, his bald pate exposed, his face bloodied.
Perhaps more than the Pro Football Hall of Fame would do later, the image immortalized Tittle in football lore — in the image of the aging warrior who had finally fallen.
Yelberton Abraham Tittle Jr. was born on Oct. 24, 1926, in the East Texas town of Marshall and grew up there, the son of a postal worker. As a youngster, he idolized Texas Christian’s star quarterback Sammy Baugh and threw footballs through hanging tires as he had seen Baugh do in newsreels. His older brother, Jack, who went on to play blocking back in the single wing for Tulane, honed Y. A.’s football skills when he played junior high and high school football.
Tittle became a two-time all-Southeastern Conference quarterback playing for L.S.U. from 1944 to 1947, having been deferred from military service in World War II because of asthma. As a junior, he led the Tigers to the 1947 Cotton Bowl game, a 0-0 tie with Arkansas on a windy, frigid day.
He made his pro debut with the Baltimore Colts of the All-America Football Conference in 1948 and was named rookie of the year. He credited his coach, Cecil Isbell, formerly an outstanding passer for the Green Bay Packers, with fine-tuning his technique and bolstering his confidence.
Tittle joined the 49ers when the Colts disbanded after the 1950 season, their first year in the N.F.L. (A later Baltimore Colts franchise was far more successful.)
He played for two seasons behind Frankie Albert, a 49ers future Hall of Famer, then became the No. 1 quarterback in 1953. He handed off to running backs Joe Perry, Hugh McElhenny and John Henry Johnson in what became known as the Million Dollar Backfield (for brilliance on the field, not for the salaries they earned) and later threw soaring “alley oop” passes to R. C. Owens, who would race downfield and then outjump defenders.
But Tittle’s San Francisco teams never won a conference title. Late in the 1960 season, Coach Red Hickey installed a shotgun formation, which required occasional scrambling that the aging Tittle could not handle. Hickey benched him in favor of the much younger and more agile John Brodie, who went on to have a stellar career of his own.
Photo
Shortly before the 1961 season began, Tittle was traded to the Giants for Lou Cordileone, a young guard, in what became one of pro football’s most lopsided deals. “Me for Tittle?” a startled Cordileone remarked. “Just me?”

Tittle replaced the Giants’ longtime star quarterback, 40-year-old Charlie Conerly, as the starter for much of the 1961 season. Teaming up on pass plays with Del Shofner, Kyle Rote and Joe Walton, he took the Giants to the N.F.L. championship game. But they lost, 37-0, to the Packers on a frozen field at Green Bay, and Conerly retired after that.
Tittle tied an N.F.L. single-game record by throwing seven touchdown passes against the Washington Redskins in 1962. He threw 33 touchdown passes for the season, setting a league record, but frigid wind gusts and a strong Green Bay rush in the N.F.L. title game at Yankee Stadium stymied him in the Packers’ 16-7 victory.
Tittle passed for 36 touchdowns in 1963, but he tore a knee ligament in the first half against the Chicago Bears at Wrigley Field in the N.F.L. championship game when he was tackled by Larry Morris. Heavily taped, Tittle returned for the second half but was unable to properly plant his feet and was intercepted four times as the Bears scored a 14-10 victory.
The Giants were an aging team that looked nothing like the Eastern Division defending champions when they regrouped for the 1964 season. The opening game turned into a 38-7 beating at the hands of the Eagles in Philadelphia, and then it was on to Pittsburgh to face the Steelers.
The Giants were leading, 14-0, by the second quarter when Tittle, deep in Giants territory, dropped back to pass. From the right side — Tittle’s throwing side — John Baker, a 6-foot-7, 280-pound defensive end, saw an opening and smashed into Tittle, 6 feet and 190 pounds or so, as he was about to pass. The ball floated loose and into the arms of Steelers tackle Chuck Hinton, who ran it back for an easy touchdown.
As the Steelers celebrated in the end zone, Tittle knelt there, dazed and injured, and Mr. Berman captured the moment.
The Post-Gazette did not run the photo the next day; editors there did not think it was anything special. But Mr. Berman entered it for prize consideration, and it won the National Headliner award for best sports photograph of 1964. It now hangs in the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio.

“Baker had crushed the cartilage in my ribs and brutally gashed my forehead,” Tittle recalled in his memoir, “Nothing Comes Easy” (2009), written with Kristine Setting Clark.
“I also suffered a concussion and a cracked sternum. That photo would later become one of the most enduring images in sports history. What a hell of a way to get famous!”
Photo
The play was a turning point: Pittsburgh went on to win, 27-24, Tittle played out the season hampered by the rib injuries, and the Giants would finish with only two wins. “After that I knew it was time to quit, especially when I saw our other quarterback, Gary Wood, was wanting to date my daughter,” Tittle told Richard Whittingham, the author of “Giants in Their Own Words” (1992).
Tittle announced his retirement on Jan. 22, 1965, never having played on a championship team in high school, college or the pros. Later that day, the Jets, the Giants’ rival of the American Football League, held an introductory news conference for Joe Namath, their heralded rookie quarterback.
John Baker, the huge Steelers lineman who pummeled Tittle, died in 2007 after serving for 24 years as sheriff of Wake County, N.C., where he was wryly known as Little John. When Baker first ran for the office, his supporters printed posters with the photo of the battered Tittle and the caption “This is what Little John is going to do for crime in Wake County.”
“I didn’t object to that,” Baker told The Post-Gazette in 1979.
“I was just doing my job,” he said of his crushing hit on Tittle. “It’s a tough business.”
Tittle began selling insurance in the off seasons while a 49er. After his playing days, he developed his company, now called Y. A. Tittle Insurance Services and based in San Jose, Calif., into a major insurer for Silicon Valley firms and other businesses along with individuals. He hung his famous image from yesteryear in his office with the words “Nothing Comes Easy” written below.
In his memoir of the same name, Tittle recalled his playing days as a time when “I could be my own boss,” instead of having “some guy in the press box with three or four assistants” calling plays. It was, he wrote, pro football’s “golden era.”

The Mercury News of San Jose, Calif., reported that Tittle, who lived in Atherton, Calif., is survived by his daughter, Dianne de Laet, who wrote of him in the 1995 book “Giants & Heroes”; his sons, John and Patrick; his brother Don; seven grandchildren; and nine great-grandchildren. His wife, Minnette, died in 2012.
In August 1965, when Tittle approached the first autumn since his junior high school days when he would not be throwing a football, he likened himself to a warrior who had seen his last battlefield.
“It will be a strange fall for me,” he told Sports Illustrated. “For 27 years, from September to December, I have put on my armor and gone out to engage in what is, really, a sort of warfare. This fall I'll be attending to my insurance business.
“I'm too old to give it one more shot. But I wish I could.”",fake
769,Facebook and Twitter face a 'bully tax' in Britain,"Britain could hit Facebook and Twitter with a new tax designed to fight hate crimes and support victims of online bullying.
The government of Prime Minister Theresa May unveiled the proposal on Wednesday, saying it aims to ensure that ""Britain is the safest place in the world to be online.""
Culture Secretary Karen Bradley said the levy would target social media companies and communication service providers.
Details remain thin, however: The government did not single out specific companies, detail how the tax would be applied or estimate how much money it would raise.
Bradley said the levy would start as a ""voluntary measure."" But she also told the BBC that the government could pass a law if the voluntary scheme doesn't work.
She said the initiative would be similar to an existing levy on gambling companies that funds anti-addiction programs.
""The internet has been an amazing force for good, but it has caused undeniable suffering and can be an especially harmful place for children and vulnerable people,"" Bradley said.
Facebook (FB, Tech30) said in a statement that it welcomes ""close collaboration between industry, experts and government to address this important issue.""
Twitter (TWTR, Tech30) did not comment on the proposal specifically, but said in a statement that it had dramatically increased the number of abusive accounts it removes.
The tech industry has come under increased scrutiny in Europe, where politicians and regulators are considering the role of social media in society.
Related: U.K. says Facebook and Google must tackle hate speech
But analysts say there's been more talk than action so far in Britain.
""Bashing tech giants is easy. Clear, good laws for the digital age are much more difficult,"" said Carl Miller, research director at the Centre for the Analysis of Social Media at Demos. ""Government, all too often, is taking the easy route here.""
The European Union gave tech firms an ultimatum last month, saying it would pass laws allowing it to impose punishments on companies that fail to tackle online hate speech.
Related: Europe gives Facebook, Twitter final warning on hate speech
In Germany, social media companies can be fined as much as €50 million ($59 million) if they fail to quickly remove posts that breach the country's laws.
Critics of the new policies say they jeopardize free speech and expression.
Jacob Mchangama, director at the think tank Justitia, warned that Europe is moving in ""an increasing illiberal direction when it comes to internet freedom and the free flow of information.""",fake
964,The U.S. Government Is Suing People For Requesting Public Records,"By Aaron Kesel
The U.S. government is suing citizens requesting public records all over the country, violating the Freedom Of Information Act (FOIA). The government is stating that it is in “good faith” to take away more of our rights, intimidate us and delay FOIA requests, thus challenging the notion of transparency and, in turn, the Open Government Initiative.
Throughout the U.S. government, a growing number of organizations, school districts, municipalities, and state agencies have filed lawsuits against citizens for making FOIA requests to obtain public information. The governmental bodies argue that they are doing so to let the court decide a matter that isn’t quite clear legally such as when the documents may be shielded by an exemption or privacy laws. But that’s causing problems, and becoming a new way for governments to hide information from taxpayers and even news organizations or individual journalists.
The practice, although highly ridiculed and uncommon, has been going on for years according to Columbia Journalism Review.
However, recently the Associated Press reported three different cases where the government sued citizens in the last year.
In the first case, an Oregon parent Kim Sordyl and journalist Beth Slovic sought details about Portland Public School employees on paid leave. The school board responded by suing them both, arguing that the records are exempt from disclosure due to the personal privacy of employees.
The second case involved two retired teachers, Dr. James Finney and Mike Deshotels, who were sued by Louisiana Department of Education for trying to get information on the school’s enrollment data relating to economically disadvantaged and English proficiency students. The two eventually ended up winning the case in a settlement but not before fighting for their rights in court to even see the data and spending $3,000 in legal fees.
Finally, the third case highlighting this abusive practice that the publication mentioned was Western Kentucky University suing two newspapers. The University filed a lawsuit against its paper, the College Heights Herald and the University of Kentucky campus newspaper, Kentucky Kernel, which sought records related to allegations of sexual harassment and assault involving its faculty. That story titled: “In The Dark: Records shed light on sexual misconduct at Kentucky universities” went on to win the University of Georgia’s Betty Gage Holland Award for excellence in college journalism and using a FOIA request to bring the questionable abuse to light.
“It’s appropriate to say it’s troubling the university (WKU) is suing its own newspaper for practicing good journalism,” attorney Michael Abate told the WKU paper, the College Heights Herald. “Even if they have a valid basis for withholding information, they still have to submit redacted documents.”
In 2015 a New Jersey Judge Michael Winkelstein ruled in favor of Harry Scheeler Jr. who was seeking Hamilton Township police surveillance video and was subsequently sued for his request, Columbia Journalism Review reported. In New Jersey, the state has a law called the Open Public Records Act (OPRA) in place of a Freedom of Information request. The judge ruled that such practices of governments counter-suing citizens was the antithesis of OPRA.
Winkelstein found that,
A government lawsuit against requestors subjects them to involuntary litigation with all of its concomitant financial, temporal, and emotional trimmings. A public policy that gives a government agency the right to sue a person who asks for a government document is the antithesis of the OPRA and common-law policy of providing citizens with a means of access to public information to keep government activities open and hold the government accountable.
Earlier this year in Michigan, the state House voted overwhelmingly 108-0 in favor of a bill that would make it illegal for government agencies to sue citizens who request public records.
The legislation was in response to a local county’s lawsuit against a newspaper that was seeking documents on two employees running for sheriff. A judge dismissed the lawsuit, saying the county had to approve or deny the request.
The bill’s sponsor, Republican Rep. Klint Kesto, called the lawsuit “a backdoor channel to delay and put pressure on the requester” that circumvents the state’s Freedom of Information Act.
“Government shouldn’t file a lawsuit and go on offense. Either approve the request or deny it,” he said. “This shouldn’t be happening anywhere in the country.”
It’s troubling that so many of these requests have resulted in lawsuits against citizens who have a right to know public information under the Freedom of Information Act.

Country singer Jason Aldean opened the second episode of the NBC variety series' 43rd season with a Tom Petty cover just days after playing as the mass shooting began in Las Vegas on Sunday.
""This week we witnessed one of the worst tragedies in American history. Like everyone I'm struggling to understand what happened that night and how to pick up the pieces and start to heal,"" Aldean said starting the show. ""So many people are hurting.""
Aldean took the stage of Studio 8H less than a week after performing at the Route 91 Festival in Las Vegas where the shooting took place. During his performance, gunfire rained down from the 32nd flood of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino across the streets, causing him to flee the stage.
The shooting injured more than 500 people and killed at least 58.
The singer, who was wearing all black including a black cowboy hat, added ""We hurt for you and we hurt with you, but you can be sure that we're gonna walk through these tough times together every step of the way.""

Aldean then went into a rendition of ""I Won't Back Down"" by Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers.
The song choice was even more poignant considering that Petty died Monday at the age of 66.

The US president said if there was no deal on the North American Free Trade Agreement, it would be terminated.
He was speaking at the White House with visiting Canadian PM Justin Trudeau.
Replying to a question, Mr Trump said he said he would consider a trade pact with Canada minus Mexico, adding that both the US and Canada wanted to protect their workers.
The current round of talks on renegotiating the trade bloc is reported to be stalling, with Mexico opposing a US move to increase the percentage of US-made components in car manufacturing.
Mr Trump's stance has however been criticised by US businesses,
And Mexican foreign minister Luis Videgaray, speaking ahead of the latest round of talks, said terminating Nafta could harm US-Mexico relations and damage co-operation on issues like fighting drug-trafficking.
Mr Trudeau said he believed the Nafta talks could still end in a ""win, win, win"".
But he said that Canada had to ""be ready for anything"" if the attempts to modernise the 23-year-old deal faltered.
Overall trade between the three Nafta partners reached $1.1 trillion (£832bn) in 2016.
American and Mexican officials say they want a renegotiated deal by December.
This week the influential US Chamber of Commerce warned it was time to ""ring alarm bells"" over the Nafta talks.
The business lobby group said there were ""several poison pill proposals"" put on the table by the US that could tank the renegotiations.
Those include US demands to adjust the rules of origin, which would increase the percentage of the content of car parts and other materials that would come from Nafta countries in order for a good to qualify as duty free - a specific concern for the North American auto industry.
'We disagree vehemently'
The US and Canadian leaders also discussed the Bombardier-Boeing trade dispute.

Canada and the UK are sparring with the US over Canadian aerospace giant Bombardier.
The Trump administration has imposed hefty duties on Bombardier's C-Series jetliner.
American aerospace firm Boeing claims Bombardier received unfair government subsidies to produce its showcase passenger jet.
Bombardier is a significant employer in Northern Ireland and Canada.
Mr Trudeau said he ""highlighted to the president how much we disagree vehemently"" on the decision to impose anti-dumping duties.",fake

""If Bob Corker has any honor, any decency, he should resign immediately,"" Bannon said in an interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity on Monday night.
Corker and Trump exchanged insults on Twitter over the weekend, and in an interview with The New York Times published Sunday , Corker said Trump is acting ""like he's doing 'The Apprentice' or something,"" and added that he could set the nation ""on the path to World War III.""
Last week , Corker praised Trump's inner circle while taking a jab at the commander in chief, and said Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Defense Secretary James Mattis and White House Chief of Staff John Kelly ""help separate our country from chaos.""
Corker has announced he will not run for re-election after 2018.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - U.S. smartphone chipmaker Qualcomm has offered concessions in an attempt to allay EU antitrust concerns over its $38-billion bid for NXP Semiconductors, the largest ever in the semiconductor industry.
Qualcomm, which supplies chips to Android smartphone makers and Apple, submitted its proposal on Oct. 5, a filing on the European Commission site showed on Monday, without providing details.
The EU competition enforcer, which suspended the deadline for its decision on Aug. 17 for a second time while waiting for information data from Qualcomm, said it would set a new deadline once the company has complied with its request.
The Commission is expected to seek feedback from rivals and customers in the coming days. It is concerned the combined company may use incentives to squeeze out rivals and raise prices, as well change NXP’s intellectual property licensing model.

3405,Toyota seeking to halve Japan car models as domestic market shrinks,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp is aiming to halve the number of car models it sells at home by 2025, a person briefed on the matter said - the second time this month that a Japanese automaker has emerged with plans to sharply scale back in a shrinking domestic market.
Car sales in Japan have been on a declining trend for more than two decades as the population rapidly ages and young people are losing interest in car ownership. At the same time, global automakers are increasingly focusing their R&D efforts on electric cars and self-driving technologies.
Toyota offers about 60 car models in Japan, where consumers clamor for variety. But it aims to gradually cut that to about 30 by 2025 to make better use of resources, the person said, declining to be identified as he was not authorized to speak on the matter.
But even halved, the new domestic model portfolio would still beat the 25 models available in North America, Toyota’s biggest market.
The plan comes on the heels of Honda Motor Co Ltd’s announcement last week that it aims to end production at a domestic factory by 2022, cutting output in Japan by 24 percent to focus on electric cars and other technologies.
Toyota spokeswoman Akiko Kita declined to comment on product plans but said the company was pursuing a number of strategies to maintain sales of at least 1.5 million Toyota-branded vehicles annually in Japan. It currently sells around 1.6 million a year.
The domestic line-up for Japan’s No. 1 automaker includes the popular Prius gasoline hybrid and the Aqua compact hatchback, versions of which are also available overseas. It also sells lower-volume models, including the Premio sedan, that are often derivatives of other models.
“As Toyota begins to develop EVs for markets including China, Europe and the United States, they will likely focus on making models which can be sold both at home and abroad,” said Yoshiaki Kawano, manager of Japan/Korea vehicle sales forecasts at IHS Automotive.",fake
1769,"Waiver Worthy: RB Edition: Latavius Murray, Wayne Gallman Among Must Add Options","Waiver Worthy: RB Edition: Latavius Murray, Wayne Gallman Among Must Add Options
(Before It's News)
by Eric Stashin (aka The Rotoprofessor)
Week 4 created numerous opportunities for running backs who could quickly emerge as must use fantasy options on a weekly basis. There were some significant injuries (Chris Carson, Dalvin Cook), while others continued to underperform. Let’s take a look at the running backs you are going to want to target off the wire, and which ones you may want to ignore:
Wayne Gallman – New York Giants – Running Back
Paul Perkins has been a bitter disappointment over the first few weeks, with 32 carries for 61 yards (1.9 yards per carry) and 0 TD. You could argue that the Giants need to look elsewhere, even if Perkins hadn’t gone down with a rib injury. Instead that just expedited the process, and Gallman stepped in and showed more upside immediately:
Rushing – 11 carries for 42 yards
Receiving – 2 receptions for 8 yards and 1 TD
A fourth round draft pick, Walter Football compared him to former Giant starter Rashad Jennings prior to the draft. It’s an interesting comparison, as he had some solid seasons in New York and shows that Gallman has the potential to run with the role.
Verdict – Must add in all formats
Latavius Murray – Minnesota Vikings – Running Back
The Vikings lost their dynamic rookie runner, Dalvin Cook, and are now left to try and pick up the pieces. Murray has shown ample potential as a starter in the past, his biggest problem has been more based on injuries than anything (and talk is he’s currently not 100%). In 14 games last season with Oakland Murray averaged 4.0 yards per carry after eclipsing 1,000 yards in 2015. The biggest upside is in the TD department, having scored 12 TD last season, and he’s also shown an ability to catch passes.
There are other options for the Vikings, including Bishop Sankey and Jerrick McKinnon, so Murray will likely share the snaps (though he should dominate the early down work). He may not have elite upside, but we know what he is and the potential for him to contribute. Consider him a must own.
Verdict – Must add in all formats
Andre Ellington – Arizona Cardinals – Running Back
The Cardinals have appeared committed to Chris Johnson over the past few weeks, though it’s obvious that he’s not the running back with the highest potential. Just look at the Week 4 production:
Chris Johnson – 13 carries for 32 yards
Andre Ellington – 5 carries for 18 yards
Obviously Ellington’s 3.6 YPC isn’t going to blow you away, though he was targeted 14 times (team leader) and turned it into 9 receptions for 86 yards. Ellington is never going to be the lead runner, as Arizona looks to limit his touches and keep him healthy, and you also can’t bank on this many targets on a weekly basis. He’s ownable, especially in PPR formats, but he’s not going to be among the top waiver targets.
Verdict – Must add in PPR formats; worth stashing in standard leagues with 14+ teams
Elijah McGuire – New York Jets – Running Back
He exploded for 93 yards and 1 TD on 10 carries in Week 4, and now has taken 23 carries for 156 yards and 1 TD in his rookie season (6.8 yards/carry). He wasn’t the only Jets’ running back who stepped up in the absence of Matt Forte, as Bilal Powell took 21 carries for 163 yards and 1 TD. The question is if McGuire will take on a bigger workload, and if Matt Forte is going to eat into both players touches.
Time will tell how the situation plays out, but for as long as Forte is out (and look for the Jets to be “cautious”) expect Powell to lead the pack with McGuire syphoning off 10-12 touches per week. That brings potential FLEX appeal, and if Powell were to get hurt McGuire would have the opportunity to step in and thrive.
Verdict – Worth adding as depth option, if you have the roster spot
Alex Collins – Baltimore Ravens
The Baltimore offense is in shambles, but Collins was an obvious bright spot in Week 4 as he was by far the best runner:
Alex Collins – 9 carries for 82 yards
Javorius Allen – 2 carries for 7 yards
Terrance West – 4 carries for -7 yards
Allen is going to remain the primary pass catcher, but Collins should get an opportunity to operate as the early down runner moving forward (as long as he can hold onto the football, with fumble issues quickly cropping up). That makes him worth the add as a depth option, but we’ll have to wait and see before plugging him into your lineup.
Verdict – Must add in leagues of 14+ teams
Green Bay Running Backs
The word now is that Ty Montgomery isn’t injured as badly as originally thought, and we know when healthy he’s going to be the lead back. Aaron Jones is the top healthy back is worth adding, while Jamaal Williams is also worth stashing, but neither offer long-term appeal at this point.
Verdict – Jones may be a short-term play, but nothing more
Higher Ownership Options
Alvin Kamara – New Orleans Saints – He exploded for 10 catches, 71 yards and 1 TD, while adding 5 carries for 25 yards. He’s clearly one of the two main parts of the committee, with Adrian Peterson (4 carries for 4 yards) falling out of the mix. Kamara doesn’t offer lead back upside (if Mark Ingram were to get hurt, Peterson will likely assume the opportunities), but in PPR formats he’s a must add.
Thomas Rawls – Seattle Seahawks – He was a healthy scratch in Week 4, but with Chris Carson getting injured Rawls is going to jump back into a prominent role. Of course Eddie Lacy is going to have something to say about that, though Rawls is the preferred addition.
Eddie Lacy – Seattle Seahawks – He was the backup to Carson in Week 4 and turned 11 carries into 52 yards. He’s also hard to trust, and is going to be part of a three or four man timeshare (C.J. Prosise and J.D. McKissic). The Seattle situation remains one that’s best left ignored.

Cincinnati Bengals at Cleveland Browns
October 1, 2017
Bengals 29, Browns 17
I thought the Browns defense would lead the team to a few victories this year. I thought Myles Garrett and Jamie Collins would help that happen.
No pick today.
Browns 21, Bengals 17
This is the time of the Browns season when I start thinking about what else I could be doing on Sundays. After last week’s “Fool me once” pick, though, I play the fool once more in believing the Browns can scratch out a victory against the winless Bengals. An 0-4 start against this portion of the schedule would truly crank up the draft talk, “Fire Hue!” calls, and other Browns-related tedium that returns every year to Berea like the swallows to Capistrano. Meanwhile, I’ll turn my eyes to the two actual, factual championship-level teams we have in this town.
Bengals 38, Browns 6
The Juice is loose as of 12:01 this morning, Vegas time. Can he catch? Could he be any worse than our current WRs?
Bengals 31, Browns 24
The Browns shall not ruin my giddiness of getting D. Wade this week. He’s not the addition he would’ve been five years ago, but a move that’s being undersold by the pundits and local fans. Very ironic that C-Town is now home to two out of three most evil Big 3.

(Before It's News)
by Eric Stashin (aka The Rotoprofessor)
Trying to decide who you should start or sit this week? Let’s take a look at a few potential decisions owners have and try to sort through them:
Quarterbacks
Start – Trevor Siemian – Denver Broncos – vs. Oakland
Siemian is a tough quarterback to trust, because the Broncos have always seemed like they wanted Paxton Lynch to take command of the starting role. Then you have a rather poor showing in Week 3, including throwing a pair of INT and having posted a season worst 6.48 yards/attempt. Of course that came on the road, whereas this week he returns home to take on a Raiders’ defense that has allowed the fourth most points per week to opposing quarterbacks (and has yet to get an INT).
A home start against a secondary that doesn’t scare you? It seems like an ideal week to utilize Siemian in your starting lineup. He may not throw for over 300 yards, but the opportunity for TD will be there and that’s vital.
Sit – Dak Prescott – Dallas Cowboys – vs. Los Angeles Rams
The Rams are one of the stingier defenses against opposing quarterbacks thus far. Then you have an offense that is going to run through Ezekiel Elliot and the running game, as evidenced by only 18 passing attempts in Week 3 against Arizona. Of course that seems like the exception to the rule (Prescott had 89 attempts over the first two weeks), except for the fact that Los Angeles has allowed the second most points per week to opposing running backs, thanks to the second most rushing yards (399) and the most rushing TD (5). It’s hard not to expect Elliot to be the focal point of the offense once again, putting Prescott’s performance at risk.
Running Backs
Start – Joe Mixon – Cincinnati Bengals – at Cleveland
The question Mixon has faced is opportunity, but that appeared to resolve itself in Week 3 with a new offensive coordinator running the show:
Joe Mixon – 18 carries for 62 yards, 3 receptions for 39 yards
Jeremy Hill – 7 carries for 23 yards, 1 reception for 6 yards
Giovani Bernard – 3 carries for 37 yards, 2 receptions for 12 yards
Mixon is going to continue to give up some touches to the other two options, but he should continue as the clear leader and possesses the most upside. With things becoming clear, he’s now a must use option.
Start – Chris Carson – Seattle Seahawks – vs. Indianapolis
Much like Mixon, Carson has taken control of the team’s backfield and is the clear leader ahead of Thomas Rawls. With C.J. Prosise out for Week 4, Carson’s role could expand even further and he could see more opportunities in the passing game (4 receptions for 35 yards and 1 TD thus far). Taking on an Indianapolis defense that has allowed 360 yards to opposing running backs through three weeks (201 rushing yards, 159 receiving yards), he could be in line for his biggest week to date.
Sit – Marshawn Lynch – Oakland Raiders – at Denver
While the Broncos have allowed the third fewest rushing yards thus far, the only two teams to allow fewer are the ones who have only played two games (Miami and Tampa Bay). Over three weeks Denver has allowed 142 yards and 0 TD on 58 carries for running backs (2.4 yards per carry), with the “blemish” being running backs who catch the football (105 receiving yards and 1 TD). As it is Lynch is averaging just 3.9 yards per carry, has 1 TD and is not a factor in the passing game. That makes Lynch a tough sell as a RB2, and while you can utilize him as a FLEX he’s a risky proposition at best.
Sit – Mark Ingram – New Orleans Saints – at Miami
The Saints’ backfield remains a bit of a mystery, as Ingram shares things with Adrian Peterson and Alvin Kamara. Ingram has gotten between 11 and 16 touches over the first three weeks, which could be enough to make an impact but it is not a guarantee (he’s averaging around 78 yards per game). The biggest thing is that he has yet to find the end zone, though the fact that his touches are not guaranteed and that the Dolphins are allowing 70 rushing yards per week to opposing running backs makes him a risky play.
Wide Receivers (Two-Receiver Formats)
Start – Golden Tate – Detroit Lions – at Minnesota
It would be easy to overlook Tate in shallower formats, with just 83 total yards over his past two games. That said he’s been targeted at least 11 times in two of the three games this season and he draws a Vikings’ defense that has allowed the second most points per week to opposing wide receivers. With a league high 638 receiving yards allowed, you know Detroit will take to the air and Tate should be the leader of the pack.
Sit – T.Y. Hilton – Indianapolis Colts – at Seattle
Hilton finally had a big day in Week 3, hanging 7 receptions for 153 yards and 1 TD against the Browns. Of course things are likely going to be completely different in Week 4, as the Colts travel to Seattle to take on one of the stronger defenses in the league. We all know the Seahawks’ history and with ample questions hanging over Indianapolis Hilton is going to be a tough sell in shallower formats.
Wide Receivers (Three-Receiver Formats)
Start – Pierre Garcon – San Francisco 49ers – at Arizona
It’s easy to overlook Garcon, as he’s not a flashy option. He is steady, though, and he’s posted strong performances in two of the three games thus far (he has 10 targets and at least 80 yards in two of his three contests). He’s going to remain the team’s top option, and the Cardinals have allowed the third most points per week to opposing wide receivers.
Sit – Jermaine Kearse – New York Jets – vs. Jacksonville
Jacksonville has allowed opponents to turn 48 targets into just 19 receptions, 201 yards and 1 TD. That’s among the best in the league, and while Kearse is the “leader” of the Jets’ receiving corps he’s yet to exceed 64 yards in a game and has gotten 8 targets over the past two weeks. Even in deeper formats he’s impossible to trust.
Tight Ends
Start – Cameron Brate – Tampa Bay Buccaneers – vs. New York Giants
The Giants have shown a weakness against opposing tight ends this season, including 3 TD allowed. While Brate has not done much, he has turned 7 targets into 6 receptions and has 1 TD. While he may not be the most trustworthy option, if you don’t have one of the elite he’s as good of a gamble as there is.
Sit – Hunter Henry – Los Angeles Chargers – vs. Philadelphia
There was a lot of hype heading into the season, but Henry hasn’t even been targeted in two of the three games. Will this be another rebound game or will he again be a non-factor in the game plan? It’s impossible to predict, and therefore he can’t be trusted.

(Before It's News)
This is not going to be your traditional Steelers/Ravens matchup Sunday at M&T Bank Stadium.
There is still angst among both fanbases over players taking a knee during the National Anthem in Week 3. If social media is any indication, many fans plan to boycott this week’s game. Some have even vowed to never watch the NFL again.
A petition to tear down the Ray Lewis statue at M&T Bank Stadium has gotten so much attention extra security was hired to protect the monument.
It’s a divisive topic because there is also a large group of fans that support the player’s stance and their right to freedom of speech.
This is easily the most volatile period in Ravens history.
The coaches and players understand the anger of some of the fans. However, John Harbaugh was more focused on putting together a game plan for the Steelers, rather than worrying about how many people are going to be watching from the stands.
The winner of this game will take over first place in the AFC North at the quarter point of the season.
“We’re spending our time getting ready for the game,” Harbaugh said this week. “That’s what you do as a coach. That was my first point. That’s what we’re doing; we’re getting ready for this game. We had a morning full of meetings on the opponent we’re going to play – the Pittsburgh Steelers – who we respect tremendously. We’re getting ready to play a football game, and that’s what we do, and that’s all we can do.
“The other issues are bigger than that; they are beyond our ability to address and deal with that, but we can focus on the task at hand, and that’s our responsibility. That’s our job, and that’s what we’re required to do.”
The players have stayed unified in their support for one another. The protest is supposed to bring more attention to social injustice. However, it was also a reaction to comments made by President Donald Trump, who said players should be fired for taking a knee.
“Wouldn’t you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, ‘Get that son of a (expletive) off the field right now,” Trump said, via USA Today. “Out. He’s fired. He’s fired!’”
These comments did not go over well with the players and this boosted the movement for taking a knee.
In Week 3, Steelers left tackle Alejandro Villanueva broke rank and stood in the tunnel with his hand over his heart during the Anthem while his teammates stayed in the locker room. The following day, he had the top selling jersey in the NFL, but later said it was “very embarrassing” for not going along with the rest of the players’ plan.
The players on the Ravens plan to stay unified. The team has already discussed what they are going to do during the National Anthem on Sunday. However, they are keeping those plans private until the actual moment arrives.
If the Bears/Packers game on Thursday night was any indication, the players and coaches will lock arms, rather than kneeling. The players appear to be tired of the controversy and answering questions about whether they plan to kneel.
“We have to get back to playing football eventually, so we are going to keep it private amongst the team, but our main focus this week is the Pittsburgh Steelers,” linebacker Terrell Suggs said about Sunday.
At this point, we could all use some normalcy.

(Before It's News)
While the playoff committee doesn’t rank the power 5 conference, there is no way conference strength – which means OOC results doesn’t figure in to a committee members thought process.
Let me point out on my philosophy on these rankings – your most recent OOC results count a lot, and you’ll see me reference that throughout the season.
We’ll give each conference a relative strength value 1-10.
Let me explain my relative rankings
0-5 : Conference lacks depth no elite teams
6-7: Conference lacks depth, and there are 1-2 elite teams, and 1-2 quality teams
7-8: At least 2 elite teams, and at least 2 quality teams.
8-9: 3 elite teams, and at least 2 quality teams
9-10: 1/2 of conference is elite and/or quality teams.
1) SEC – 7.5
I’m elevating the SEC this week, because I’m starting to buy that they have 3 legit top 12 teams in Alabama, Georgia, and Auburn. Beyond that the conference has little depth. Though Texas A&M and South Carolina may be decent.
Auburn has an interesting game at LSU next week. Alabama and Georgia get SEC pushovers Arkansas and Missouri.
Playoff Contenders
Alabama, Georgia
In the Playoff Picture
Auburn
2) ACC – 7.4
Clemson cruised to a win over Wake Forest. Miami got a big victory over Florida State to get into darkhorse playoff position. NC State and Virginia Tech give the ACC their other two ranked teams.
The Tigers go to Syracuse this week, and Miami hosts tricky Georgia Tech.
Playoff Contenders
Clemson

Miami
3) Big 10 – 7.3
Michigan took a bad home loss Michigan State, that dropped it out of playoff contention for now. We’re not paying attention to Ohio State until they beat a ranked team.
Wisconsin hosts Purdue this week, but they should be fine in that one.
Playoff Contenders
Penn State
In the Playoff Picture
Wisconsin
4) Pac 12 – 7.2
Utah dropped from the playoff chase after losing at home to Stanford. Washington State looked impressive winning at Oregon, and Washington continues to roll.
Washington State plays a dangerous game at Cal, and Washington is at Arizona State in a game that they can’t overlook.
Playoff Contenders
Washington

Washington State
5) Big 12 – 7.1
The Big 12 took a devastating loss when Oklahoma lost to Iowa State. The Sooners went from playoff lock to needing a lot of help. TCU is the Big 12’s only remaining viable playoff candidate at the moment as they beat West Virginia.
TCU faces a test Kansas State this week.
Playoff Contenders
TCU
In the Playoff Picture
NONE
The Rest
Unless a Group of 5 or independent team can reach the top 15, there’s not much to note outside the Power 5 in terms of the playoff.

In the Playoff Picture
NONE
My Current Playoff Teams
As my personal criticism of the playoff committee, I don’t think the top 4 seeds order should be released until the final rankings. The playoff committee’s inconsistent and ever changing criteria is causing unnecessary frustration and confusion. It’s one of the improvement points I’d have for them.
If I had a vote this is who I would put in the playoff right now.
In – Penn State | Alabama | Clemson | Washington

(Before It's News)
CDN – http://www.conservativedailynews.com
By Donn Marten
In a rather ironic piece of news coming as the national media pays a glowing tribute to the life and career of the now deceased Playboy founder Hugh Hefner, a Centers for Disease Control (CDC) report states that over 110 million Americans now have some sort of sexually transmitted disease. Hefner’s magazine was instrumental in ushering in the so-called sexual revolution with its glossy pictures of nude women including a famous centerfold of the Playmate of the Month. The 91-year-old high priest of hedonism passed away earlier this week at the age of 91 but one might suggest that the CDC report is his legacy. He was a smut-peddler even if his smut was of high quality and sandwiched between articles and a monthly interview that made Playboy unlike any of the other men’s magazines that specialized in borderline pornography and beaver shots over the classy package that made Hefner into a very rich man. It is arguable that the ascent of Playboy coincided with a rise of sexual permissiveness, promiscuity and the eventual deemphasizing of traditional marriage as horny men inspired by Playboy turned away from their wives to get it elsewhere. Hefner’s cultural influence led to the reduction of women to …

1259,Hill Russia investigators: Panel still searching for 'any hint of collusion',"(CNN) Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr said Wednesday that the panel ""has more work to do"" to determine whether there was collusion between Russian officials and Donald Trump's team during last year's presidential election.
""The committee continues to look into all evidence to see if there was any hint of collusion,"" Burr said at a Capitol Hill news conference, standing alongside the committee's top Democrat, Mark Warner of Virginia.
Burr said the committee continues to look for ""any hint of collusion"" but has not come to any initial conclusions on that question, as it is still conducting interviews and reviewing documents, including 25 additional interviews this month.
The news conference Burr and Warner held to provide a progress report on their monthslong probe underscored their investigation is growing in scope and is not shying away from the question of collusion — which Trump has repeatedly dismissed as a ""hoax.""
Burr and Warner said they have largely confirmed the conclusions the intelligence community reached under the Obama administration that the Russian government meddled in the 2016 US election.
While Burr sidestepped questions about whether the Russians were trying to help Trump, one of the conclusions the intelligence community found, he warned that the efforts to interfere are still ongoing and must be addressed ahead of the next round of US elections later this year and in 2018.
""We have not come to any determination on collusion or Russia's preferences,"" the North Carolina Republican said. ""It seems that the overall theme of the Russian involvement in the US elections was to create chaos at every level. And I would tell you the fact that we're sitting here nine months later investigating it, they have been pretty darn successful.""
Burr said he did not have a timeline on when the investigation will conclude, though he said somewhat wistfully that his ""aspirational goal"" was still to end by the end of year.
Burr ticked off the areas of possible collusion the committee had already probed, and also issued a blanket threat to future witnesses that they should testify voluntarily or face a subpoena.
""Future witnesses that we might ask to come in the future, I strongly suggest you come in and speak with us,"" Burr said. ""If we believe that you have something valuable to bring to the committee, if you don't voluntarily do it, I will assure you today you will be compelled to do it.""
He noted the committee had ""hit a wall"" in its effort to interview Christopher Steele , the author of a controversial dossier containing explosive allegations about Trump and top members of his campaign, and he called on Steele to meet with the panel.
Burr said that both he and Warner made personal efforts to reach Steele, but he had not accepted their invitations. Burr said the committee ""cannot decide the credibility"" of the dossier without understanding who paid for it and its sources.
CNN reported in early January t hat Trump was briefed on the dossier, which includes allegations about Trump's associates, finances and personal life, and Trump has gone on to dismiss its contents entirely as ""phony.""
Burr also said the panel had interviewed seven attendees of an April 2016 event at the Mayflower Hotel -- where then-Russian Ambassador to the US Sergey Kislyak spoke briefly with Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner -- and their testimony was consistent. The panel also talked to everyone involved with the changing of the Republican platform on Ukraine, and Burr said the staff believed in what they were implementing.
Burr said the committee's examination of the memos of former FBI Director James Comey ""has reached a logical end as it relates to the Russia investigation,"" indicating the committee didn't plan to delve further into the question of obstruction of justice, something Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller is investigating.
Burr and Warner brought a chart to the news conference that detailed the amount of work the committee has done so far, including more than 100 interviews at over 250 hours, more than 4,000 transcript pages and 100,000 pages of documents reviewed.
Burr said the committee has interviewed every intelligence community official involved in drafting the report on Russian election meddling, as well as Obama administration officials involved.
The committee has spoken behind closed doors to members of the intelligence community as well as Trump's inner circle, including former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and Kushner.
There are several public hearings on the horizon. The first is for Trump's personal attorney, Michael Cohen, who had been scheduled for a private staff interview last month, but the committee postponed the appearance and invited him to a public session instead after Cohen provided a statement to the media denying any collusion with Russian officials.
The Senate intelligence panel has also invited Facebook, Twitter and Google to testify at a public hearing next month on Russia's use of social media in elections, which has become a major focus of the panel's probe in recent weeks.
Facebook on Monday provided Congress with copies of the 3,000 Russian-linked election ads it identified, as well as data including where the ads were targeted. CNN reported Tuesday that the ads targeted crucial swing states Wisconsin and Michigan
The Senate intelligence committee is one of three congressional panels that are investigating Russian election meddling and possible collusion, in addition to Mueller's investigation.

1429,How we tick: U.S. 'body clock' scientists win Nobel medicine prize,"STOCKHOLM/LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. scientists Jeffrey Hall, Michael Rosbash and Michael Young won the 2017 Nobel prize for medicine on Monday for unraveling molecular mechanisms that control our internal body clocks.
These help explain how people experience jet lag when their internal circadian rhythms get out of sync, while also having wider implications for disorders ranging from insomnia to depression to heart disease.
Chronobiology, or the study of biological clocks, is now a growing field of research thanks to the pioneering work of the three scientists, who explained the role of specific genes in keeping fruit flies in step with light and darkness.
Today, scientists are exploring new treatments based on such circadian cycles, including establishing the best times to take medicines, and there is an increased focus on the importance of healthy sleeping patterns.
“This ability to prepare for the regular daily fluctuations is crucial for all life forms,” Thomas Perlmann, secretary of the Karolinska Institute Nobel Committee, told reporters.
“This year’s Nobel prize laureates have been studying this fundamental problem and solved the mystery of how an inner clock in our bodies can anticipate daily fluctuations between night and day to optimize our behavior and physiology.”
Rosbash said the news that the trio had won the Nobel prize, which is worth 9 million Swedish crowns ($1.1 million), was “a little overwhelming”.
“It took my breath away, literally. I was woken up out of deep sleep and it was shocking,” he told Reuters.
“It’s great for basic science. It hasn’t had a tremendous amount of practical impact yet, so it’s really a very basic discovery ... It’s good to have the attention on this kind of basic work.”
Hall, most recently of the University of Maine, collaborated with Rosbash while they both were at Brandeis University in Waltham, Massachusetts. They split the prize with Young of Rockefeller University in New York City.
Scientists were already pondering the concept of body clock genes in the 1960s and 1970s.

Then, in the mid-1980s, the three laureates used fruit flies to isolate a gene called period that controls the normal daily biological rhythm and showed how it encodes a protein called PER that accumulates in cells during the night and degrades during the day. Further research revealed the role of other genes in the complex system.
“We were hopeful what we did in the fly would pertain more widely,” Young said in news briefing at Rockefeller University on Monday, but added that “it has unfolded in a way that just couldn’t be imagined at the beginning.”
Young said the trio could not have anticipated that the whole system could be revealed in their lifetimes, but new scientific tools helped accelerate the work.
“Just like puzzle pieces, the genes fell out and the way they work together provided this beautiful mechanism that we now appreciate.”

Their discoveries help explain how plants, animals and humans adapt their biological rhythm to be in synch with the Earth’s revolutions.
“Before you’ve got the genes, everything is a black box,” Michael Hastings of the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, England, told Reuters: “Once you’ve got the genes, everything is possible.”
Scientists now understand that body clocks influence alertness, hunger, metabolism, fertility, mood and other physiological conditions. And researchers have begun to study the implications of erratic sleeping and working patterns or children who stay up late.
“We are learning more and more what impact it has to not follow your clock,” Nobel committee member Christer Hoog told Reuters. “If you constantly disobey your clock, what will happen? Medical research is going on with regards to that.”
Medicine is the first of the Nobel Prizes awarded each year. The prizes for achievements in science, literature and peace were created in accordance with the will of dynamite inventor and businessman Alfred Nobel and have been awarded since 1901.
Nobel medicine laureates have included scientific greats such as Alexander Fleming, the discoverer of penicillin, and Karl Landsteiner, whose identification of separate blood types opened the way to carrying out safe transfusions.
The prize has not been without controversy, especially with the benefit of hindsight, such as the 1948 award for the discovery of DDT, a chemical that helped battle epidemics but was later banned due to its harmful environmental impact.

This was a big weekend for Kesen, one of the many communities in Japan that were devastated after an earthquake and tsunami struck in March 2011.
Kesen reopened its Buddhist temple on Sunday. A Times photo editor who often chooses the images for our briefings, Hiroko Masuike, was there to capture the moment.
Ms. Masuike has been making twice-yearly visits to document residents’ struggles to rebuild their lives since the disaster, which killed almost 16,000 people and caused nuclear plant meltdowns.
In one of the community’s villages, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and reduced most buildings to rubble.
The disaster’s scars are still visible, Ms. Masuike said. Most residents have moved away, and only about 10 buildings have been rebuilt.
But Kesen’s story is also one of resilience, she said. A monk named Nobuo Kobayashi stayed and, by selling land and with the help of donations, rebuilt the 1,100 year-old Buddhist Kongoji Temple on higher ground. Its statues have also been painstakingly restored.

On Sunday, about 300 people gathered for the reopening. Monks from all over Japan chanted sutras for those who perished, Ms. Masuike said. “They prayed for the temple to stay here forever.”

1009,5 Stages of Grief - SAD!,"5 Stages of Grief – SAD!
% of readers think this story is Fact. Add your two cents.
(Before It's News)
Sigh…
This wasn’t good, you guys. From the coin-toss loss to Joe Flacco‘s post-game “I sucked,” nothing about this game felt good.
Let’s just try to get through this together and hopefully move on…
Denial
It was hard enough to swallow the Whippin’ at Wimbley last week. But to imagine the Ravens would then return to Baltimore to play their greatest rival in a matchup that is always a 1-score game, in a stadium where Pittsburgh hadn’t won since 2012… and the Ravens totally shat the bed?
There’s no way…
I just don’t understand how it’s possible that this defense went from world-beaters in Weeks 1 & 2, only to completely disappear in Week 3 and stay gone in Week 4… or how the offense has literally gone M.I.A. all season… or how the coordinators on both offense and defense fail to adjust… or how Joe can look just flat out clueless all game long…
Anger
Ya know what?
Screw it!
This team is getting exactly what they deserve, and it all starts at the top! The fun post-game stat thrown around was “Since SB XLVII 13/17 draft picks in Rounds 1-3 have been defense” So, essentially, the Ravens paid Joe Flacco like a franchise QB… then didn’t bother to help him succeed in any way possible!
Oh, I’m sorry! How could I forget Breshad Perriman!
How the hell do you expect the offense to do anything with a cast of retreads off the street, an offensive line that couldn’t block a Twitter account if they had a You Tube instructional video, and a coordinator who can’t make adjustments if his job depended on it (which it kinda does, Marty)?
Then again, there’s Joe… threw behind a wide open Perriman for a touchdown, then took time to stare down his receiver twice like a rookie QB, leading to two just flat out awful picks.
And the saddest part about that?
We’re used to that now in Baltimore. It’s become the norm…
And don’t forget the defense! Sure, the Steelers only scored 26, but they could’ve score 40+ as the Ravens defense was walked all over, all damn day long! They literally took it easy on the Ravens, dink and dunked, and ran clock. Pittsburgh didn’t have trouble scoring, they simply felt pity on Baltimore, knowing the Ravens sure as hell wouldn’t score. I’d be willing to be they had half a playbook they opted not to use, simply because they didn’t need to with the Ravens struggling so mightily…
The offense sucks, the defense sucks, the coaches are awful, and Justin Tucker missed another stupid-long field goal.
I hate this team.
Bargaining
The Ravens had a chance. One particular moment that changed the game…
Flacco had the ball in his hands just inside the Steelers Red Zone. He dropped back into a pocket that held longer than it had all day, and Joe saw a wide open Perriman about 3 yards shy of the end zone with room ahead of him…
…only to throw it behind him and over his head (nice two-inch vertical, BPerr!) for an incompletion, settling instead for a field goal.
At that point, everything began to unravel.
If only Joe had hit Perriman in stride, they’d put 7 on the board… Then again, if only the officials had deemed Eric Weddle‘s interception a clean one from the start, he could’ve had a touchdown of his own. Right there, the game would’ve been 19-14 instead of 19-9 heading into the 4th quarter. At that point, had Joe not thrown 2 extremely ill-advised, yet very typical Flacco picks, we had a chance to come out on top, instead of far shy of a win.
4 plays. 3 of them on Flacco’s shoulders.
If only we had a better quarterback, I suppose…
Depression
Anybody else already looking ahead to the draft? Trying to figure out out who will be available in the top-5 picks, and internally debating if the Ravens would be more likely to take a quarterback, Saquon Barkley, or Calvin Ridley? Or perhaps if they could trade away assets and grab multiple top-10 players?
If not, get ready to join the hype train, because this team isn’t going anywhere any time soon. They have far too many holes on the roster, too many injuries, too many question marks all around to be anything close to a functioning NFL team. The offense is just awful top to bottom. The defense has left the building. The odds this team is better than 4-12 by the end of the season are continuing to dwindle…
Hell, 2 more wins may even be a stretch, as Cincy is looking much improved, and really everybody else on the schedule other than Cleveland will give Baltimore fits.
So 3-13, and knowing Steve Biscotti? The coaching staff gets another free pass for the injury issues and they all stay, allowing for another year of subpar play.
Splendid.
Acceptance
Sigh…
Look, it is what it is, folks.
The Ravens aren’t a good team. They’re injury-riddled, the quarterback is struggling mightily, the offensive line is in shambles, the receivers can’t get open, the offensive coordinator can’t call a solid game, the defense is winded, the defensive coordinator never dials up pressure, the head coach has his own issues, and the lack of depth & talent on the current version of the 53 sans those on the IR is just a poor excuse for an NFL team, or a great version of a semi-pro team.
Either way, it simply is what it is.
If anything, we can hope to steal a few games, spoil some hot streaking team’s hope of a post season, and really just not suck any worse.
Maybe we’ll see a coaching change before the season is over. Maybe we see some of these young players blossom and give us hope moving forward. Maybe we’ll see a top-5 pick.
Not believing your team is a contender doesn’t mean you’re giving up, or any less of a fan. It simply means you’re a realist, and the bar is simply a bit lower.
Not like Cleveland low, but yanno. Still lower.

3431,Las Vegas shooting: Police in major switch of timeline,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption The attack, carried out from the Mandalay Bay hotel, killed 58 people
The gunman behind last week's Las Vegas massacre shot a security guard six minutes before the attack, police say, in a striking change to the timeline.
Police initially said the guard interrupted Stephen Paddock as the attack was under way.
The revelation raises questions as to why police did not pinpoint Paddock's location sooner.
But the Mandalay Bay hotel, where the massacre unfolded, questioned the new sequence of events.
""We cannot be certain about the most recent timeline,"" said Debra DeShong, a spokeswoman for MGM Resorts International, late on Tuesday.
""We believe what is currently being expressed may not be accurate.""
The attack left 58 people dead and was the worst in modern US history.
Security guard Jesus Campos was at first credited by authorities with distracting the gunman from killing more people.
But on Monday police revised their account of events to clarify that Mr Campos was shot in the leg and wounded at 21:59.
They said Paddock, who had placed security cameras outside his room, shot Mr Campos through the door of his suite, firing 200 rounds into the hallway.

According to police, the guard was investigating an alarm that went off in another room on the same floor when he heard a drilling sound from Paddock's room.
The gunman inserted spy cameras into the peep hole on the door of his suite, police have previously said.
Clark County Sheriff Joseph Lombardo also amended the date on which police believe Paddock checked into Mandalay Bay.

They initially said he had checked in on 28 September, three days before the shooting.
They now say he checked in on 25 September.
Paddock sprayed gunfire from the upper floors of the Mandalay Bay hotel on to a concert attended by thousands of people.
'Some things were bound to change'
Sheriff Lombardo said that police did not realise that the security guard had been shot until they arrived on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel.
That was the case even though the guard managed to alert the hotel's security team.
Mr Lombardo said new information had emerged during the investigation and that ""some things were bound to change"" given its complicated nature.
Police also say that the gunman, 64, was seen on numerous occasions in Las Vegas gambling heavily by himself the night before the shooting, which ended with him killing himself.
Paddock was dead by the time officers entered the room and it is not known why he had stopped shooting.
""This individual purposely hid his actions leading up to this event, and it is difficult for us to find the answers,"" Mr Lombardo told a news conference. Paddock's motives remain unclear.
Extensive research into the gunman's mental state found no explanation for such a violent turn of events, police say.
It is suspected Paddock scouted out other locations near open-air concerts in the weeks before the Las Vegas attack.",fake

3623,Google has found Russian ads related to 2016 election,"Google has identified tens of thousands of dollars in ad buys by Russian accounts that used YouTube or Google advertising to try to spread misinformation and sow discord in American politics, sources familiar with the company's investigation told CNN.
These accounts used YouTube, Google search advertising, Gmail advertising and Google's DoubleClick ad platform to push divisive campaigns based on issues ranging from race to immigration to gun rights at times leading up to the 2016 election.
Google has not identified how many of the accounts and ads are associated with the Internet Research Agency, the Kremlin-linked troll farm that bought ads on Facebook and Twitter.Â
The company had previously said it had found no evidence of this kind of activity.
It is possible that many of the accounts are not tied to the IRA, and that the scope of Russian meddling extends beyond what Facebook and Twitter have identified so far.
Related: Facebook: Russian ads reached 10 million people
Google also has two different sets of policies for dealing with who can create accounts and who can buy advertising, making it harder for the company to police accounts that simply created YouTube pages without paying money to advertise or have those pages promoted.
In a statement, Google spokesperson Andrea Faville said the company has ""a set of strict ads policies including limits on political ad targeting and prohibitions on targeting based on race and religion.""
""We are taking a deeper look to investigate attempts to abuse our systems, working with researchers and other companies, and will provide assistance to ongoing inquiries,"" Faville said.
The Washington Post was the first to report Google's discovery.
Like Facebook and Twitter, Google and its parent company Alphabet have agreed to testify at public hearings before the Senate and House Intelligence Committees on November 1, sources at all three companies told CNN. Google will also meet privately with the Senate and House Intelligence Committees prior to next month's public hearing, a source at the company confirmed.
Facebook, which identified 470 accounts linked to the Internet Research Agency, has shared its findings with both Twitter and Google, sources at all three companies said. Using that data, Twitter found roughly 200 accounts linked to the IRA.
Google is the largest seller of advertising online, with more than 40% revenue share for digital advertising in the United States. YouTube, which Google owns, is the largest online video service in the world.
Separately Monday, Microsoft said it is investigating to see if any similar ads were run through its services.
""We take reports of misuse of our platform seriously. We are therefore investigating and if inappropriate activity is found, we will take steps to minimize such misuse in the future,"" a Microsoft spokesperson told CNN.

Details remain thin, however: The government did not single out specific companies, detail how the tax would be applied or estimate how much money it would raise.
Bradley said the levy would start as a ""voluntary measure."" But she also told the BBC that the government could pass a law if the voluntary scheme doesn't work.
She said the initiative would be similar to an existing levy on gambling companies that funds anti-addiction programs.
""The internet has been an amazing force for good, but it has caused undeniable suffering and can be an especially harmful place for children and vulnerable people,"" Bradley said.
Facebook (FB, Tech30) said in a statement that it welcomes ""close collaboration between industry, experts and government to address this important issue.""
Twitter (TWTR, Tech30) did not comment on the proposal specifically, but said in a statement that it had dramatically increased the number of abusive accounts it removes.
The tech industry has come under increased scrutiny in Europe, where politicians and regulators are considering the role of social media in society.

But analysts say there's been more talk than action so far in Britain.
""Bashing tech giants is easy. Clear, good laws for the digital age are much more difficult,"" said Carl Miller, research director at the Centre for the Analysis of Social Media at Demos. ""Government, all too often, is taking the easy route here.""
The European Union gave tech firms an ultimatum last month, saying it would pass laws allowing it to impose punishments on companies that fail to tackle online hate speech.

LONDON (Reuters) - Nigeria’s Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, who has served as acting president for much of this year, said on Monday he had not given any thought to contesting the country’s next presidential election in 2019.
Nigeria has faced heightened uncertainty over whether President Muhammadu Buhari plans to contest the next election. Buhari, 74, took power in 2015 but has been absent for much of this year due to illness.
Osinbajo, a 60-year-old law professor, served as acting president during Buhari’s absences, succeeding in calming tensions in the oil-producing Delta region and pushing small steps to improve the business climate, including foreign currency reforms. Some business leaders say he could provide stability by running for president himself in Feb 2019.
Asked at the FT Africa Summit in London if he had considered running, Osinbajo said he hadn’t thought about it, adding: “None of that is on the cards”.
Osinbajo also said that militants in the oil-producing Niger Delta region no longer posed a significant threat to oil production.
He said Nigeria had lost as much as 1 million barrels per day (bpd) of oil production last year amid militant attacks on oil and gas infrastructure, which is concentrated in the southern Delta region. It was now pumping roughly 1.85 million bpd and climbing toward 2 million bpd. That is closer to its top production of around 2.2 million bpd.
Still, he added that Nigeria needed to diversify its oil-dependent economy and take advantage of the resource while it was still in high demand.
“We don’t have all the time in the world with oil,” he said. “We have to use oil while it makes sense to do so.”

The singer, who has had two long-running residencies in Vegas, the first in 2003, told the crowd proceeds from the night would go to the victims of Sunday's shooting at the Route 91 Harvest Festival and their families.
""Tonight is very different,"" Dion said ahead of her show, according to videos taken by fans . ""After Sunday night's incredibly tragic event, all of us here find ourselves asking a similar question. For you, it's, 'Do we still go to Celine's show on Tuesday night, only two days after the nightmare?' For me, it's, 'Can I still do my show? Should I still do my show only two days after the nightmare?' These are difficult questions.""
Dion said she ultimately decided to go on with her performances ""to show love and support for those who are affected.""
""On Sunday, we lost too many beautiful, innocent souls and so many are still suffering. But tonight, we are going to let these families know that we are supporting them and that we will help them through their tragic loss,"" she said. ""They are going to need a lot of love, a ton of emotional support, as well as a great deal of financial aid.""

1342,"After 'bloody mess' jab, Macron eyes training, job insurance reform","PARIS (Reuters) - France’s government and labor unions, united in seeking to cut unemployment but divided over how to do so, will seek common ground with a revamp of job training and unemployment insurance.
The government proposes spending an additional 15 billion euros on training over five years, with employers saying they cannot fill vacancies despite a jobless rate of close to 10 percent, higher than in many European countries.
President Emmanuel Macron also wants to bring the national unemployment insurance fund, currently jointly run by unions and employers, under the state’s control.
Macron, a former banker whose other labor market reform plans have been condemned by some trade union leaders as a deathknell for high French standards of labor protection, wants to make a professional training program less bureaucratic.
He also wants the state to have more say over how much the unemployed get in benefits and for how long, which is currently largely set by unions and employers,
On Thursday the government is due to open talks with union leaders before deciding how to overhaul training and unemployment insurance.
Training is already funded to the tune of some 30 billion euros annually, financed in part by a levy on wage-earners, but is widely criticized for not benefiting workers that need it most.
Meanwhile, unions and employers are protective of their decades-old grip over the unemployment insurance benefits system worth billions of euros.
Macron angered unionists last week with comments he made during a visit to a car parts factory, where scuffles erupted between police and workers protesting over job losses.
“Instead of kicking up a bloody mess, some of them would be better off going to see if they can get a job over there,” he said, alluding to vacancies that a nearby aluminum factory was battling to fill.
Opponents accused Macron of showing contempt toward the workforce.
Nonetheless, business owners say the skills gap is a problem.
“We just can’t get people into factories,” Pierre Tisseau, whose company makes house terraces in Cholet in western France, told Reuters.
Tisseau said he hoped reforms to professional training would help him fill vacancies he has struggled to plug since 2008.
The local branch of the Medef business federation in Cholet said 9,000 people were looking for work but that firms were finding it hard to fill 1,500 vacancies in sectors such as construction, transport and the agri-foods.
Macron defied street protests led by the Communist Party-rooted CGT union to drive through employment law reforms that critics say will weaken collective bargaining and give more power to companies to set out work conditions.",fake

3054,"On Putin's birthday, opposition activists protest, call for him to quit","MOSCOW/ST PETERSBURG (Reuters) - Police detained more than 200 opposition activists on Saturday for taking part in a wave of anti-Kremlin protests across Russia in support of jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny, ahead of a presidential election in March, a monitoring group reported.
Under grey skies and intermittent rain, over two thousand people gathered in central Moscow’s Pushkin Square and chanted “Russia will be free” and “Russia without Putin” before walking towards the Kremlin and parliament.
Police briefly detained a few people, but did not charge anyone. It was a different story at rallies in other cities however, and the OVD-Info monitoring group, a non-profit organization, said at least 262 people had been detained in 27 towns.
In St Petersburg, Putin’s home town, a Reuters witness saw riot police roughly detain at least 11 people. OVD-Info said at least 66 people had been detained in the city.
Navalny, who is serving a 20-day jail term for violating rules on public meetings, called the rally in Moscow and other cities to coincide with Putin’s 65th birthday.
Putin, who has dominated Russia’s political landscape for almost 18 years, is widely expected to run for what would be his fourth term.
Navalny hopes to run too, despite the central election commission declaring him ineligible due to a suspended prison sentence he says was politically-motivated.

One of the Moscow protesters held a homemade poster of Putin sitting on a mountain of banknotes, wearing a crown with the legend: “Happy Birthday you little thief!”
Others carried posters citing their right to protest, some waved Russian flags, and a few carried inflatable yellow ducks, a jokey reference to Navalny accusing Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev of owning a lavish estate with a duck house.
Medvedev called the claims politically-motivated nonsense.

In St Petersburg, some 1,500 activists waving red and white banners gathered in a square before heading for the city’s main street shouting “Putin is a thief” and “Free Navalny”.
PROTESTS MORE MODEST IN SIZE
The size of Saturday’s Moscow rally and others across Russia looked far more modest than Navalny-backed mass protests in March and June, which were widely recognized to be some of the biggest since 2012.
Many of the Moscow protesters were teenagers or in their twenties.
Slideshow (13 Images)
Carrying a yellow duck, Ulugbek Apsapayev, 17, said he had turned up because he wanted a better future for Russia.
“The duck is a sign that we support Alexei Navalny who also wants only good things for the country. But unfortunately we only have Vladimir Putin and his gang in power.”
Putin is popular across the country however, especially outside major cities where his strong leadership style and tough foreign policy stance go down well. He is expected to confirm later this year that he will run for another six-year term.
Opinion polls show he would comfortably beat Navalny if the opposition leader was allowed to run. Navalny says such polls are meaningless because there is no fair political competition.
Putin spent his birthday taking congratulatory calls from other world leaders, and chaired a security council meeting.
Authorities had refused to approve most of Saturday’s rallies, but Navalny says Russians’ right to protest is enshrined in the constitution.
A Reuters reporter at a rally in the Urals city of Yekaterinburg saw police detain at least eight people among a crowd of over 1,000 protesters.

268,"11 Gave Us the Police State With the ""Patriot"" Act, After Vegas Get Ready for ""USA Liberty"" Act","By Rachel Blevins
After 9/11, the United States government preyed on the fear felt by many Americans to justify the passage of the USA Patriot Act—a law that was supposed to prevent future terrorist attacks. Now, after the Las Vegas shooting, the government has another proposed law ready to go, and just as with the Patriot Act, it also infringes on Americans’ liberties, and does very little for their security.
The USA Liberty Act is the latest trendy name for a law that would reauthorize Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), which is set to expire on Dec. 31, 2017. According to the House Judiciary Committee, the act would preserve “the core purpose of Section 702: the collection of electronic communications by non-U.S. persons for use in our nation’s defense.”
However, it should be noted that while the purpose of FISA was reportedly only to allow surveillance on the communications of foreign targets who were suspected terrorists, it has been used to spy on the communications of innocent Americans—despite the practice being ruled illegal—and any reauthorization of the law will only allow the practice to continue under the guise of “preventing terrorism.”
The USA Liberty Act claims that it will “better protect Americans’ privacy” by requiring the government to have “a legitimate national security purpose” before searching an individual’s database. Then when they do have that purpose established, they will be required to “obtain a court order based on probable cause to look at the content of communications, except when lives or safety are threatened, or a previous probable cause-based court order or warrant has been granted.”
But what the USA Liberty Act does not advertise is the fact that it does not actually address the legitimate problems that exist with Section 702. The FBI’s “legitimate national security purpose” could be justified by just about any reason the agency chooses to give, and agents will only need supervisory authority in order to search Americans’ metadata.
One of the most important things to remember about Section 702 is that, as the Constitution Project noted, it gives domestic law enforcement agencies access to the data seized by the NSA, while allowing the NSA to “retain and disseminate Americans’ communications that may contain any evidence of any crime.”
In a press release on the new act, the House Judiciary Committee bragged about the “bipartisan success” of the USA Freedom Act in June 2015, claiming that it “ended the bulk collection of data, protected civil liberties and national security, and provided robust oversight and transparency of our vital national security tools.”
However, as The Free Thought Project reported in May 2015, the USA Freedom Act “doesn’t actually end or suspend the phone records program, but simply requires phone companies to hold onto these records rather than the NSA.” It also authorized, for the first time, “the NSA, FBI, and other government agencies to unconstitutionally collect data in bulk on potentially millions of law-abiding Americans,” and it let the NSA collect “cell phone records in addition to the landline call records.”
In the same way that the USA Patriot Act was the opposite of patriotic in 2001, the USA Freedom Act only took away freedom in 2015. Do not be fooled by the title—the USA Liberty Act in 2017 has nothing to do with expanding “liberty.”

117,Trump Administration Urges Congress To Renew Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA),"By Aaron Kesel
U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions is urging Congress to “promptly” reauthorize section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) scheduled to expire at the end of this year.
The Director of National Intelligence (DNI) Dan Coats also signed the letter, addressed to House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.
Section 702 of FISA “allows the Intelligence Community, under a robust regime of oversight by all three branches of government, to collect vital information about international terrorists, cyber actors, individuals and entities engaged in the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and other important foreign intelligence targets located outside the United States,” Sessions and Coats wrote.
They added: “Reauthorizing this critical authority is the top legislative priority of the Department of Justice and the Intelligence Community. As publicly reported by the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, information collected under one particular section of FAA, Section 702, produces significant foreign intelligence that is vital to protect the nation against international terrorism and other threats.”
FISA was enacted in 1978 as a response to illegal domestic surveillance operations revealed by two Senate committees in the 1970s, including President Richard Nixon’s use of federal intelligence agencies to monitor his political opponents. It was brought into law “to authorize electronic surveillance to obtain foreign intelligence information.”
The law requires the government to obtain a warrant from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court before setting up an electronic or physical wiretap targeted at foreigners and foreign agents.
Congress amended FISA in 2007 to let the government wiretap communications that either begin or end outside the United States jurisdiction without Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) approval; in a stronger 2008 overhaul, they further limited that power to non-U.S. persons. The last reauthorization of the act was in 2012, which set the current expiration date of Dec. 31, 2017.
The FISA law has long been criticized by privacy and civil liberties advocates like the EFF who say the order allows broad, intrusive spying without oversight. The section first gained renewed attention following the 2013 disclosures by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden that the agency carried out widespread monitoring of emails and other electronic communications through Prism, XKeyScore, Upstream and other NSA surveillance programs. In fact, the first Snowden leak was a FISC order issued to Verizon under Section 702 that required the company to turn over all of its calling records to the NSA.
In June earlier this year, President Trump’s homeland security and counterterrorism adviser Tom Bossert also urged Congress to review the piece of legislation before it expires on December 31st.

1299,"Vegas Shooter Filmed Himself During Slaughter, May Have Left A Note; Suicide Photo Emerges","Warning: Graphic Content Below
 
Millionaire Las Vegas shooter Stephen Paddock set up a camera inside his hotel room to capture his deadly shooting rampage on film, as well as various other surveillance equipment in the hallway to alert him as cops closed in on him. According to ABC, the shooter had at least one lens set up to tape himself as he fired hundreds of rounds on thousands of unsuspecting concertgoers several hundred yards below his Mandalay Bay casino suite. Also, knowing that the cops would eventually catch up to him, he also reportedly wired cameras in the hallway outside his room so he could see when the heat was getting close.
 
Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department Sheriff Joseph Lombardo confirmed that Paddock had cameras inside and outside of his hotel room during a late-afternoon press conference.
 
According to his brother, Paddock, 64, had made millions from real estate deals; he also owned two planes and several properties across the US, and seemed normal apart from his passion for gambling large sums. He’d also secretly amassed a massive arsenal of no less than 42 firearms with at least one of those an automatic, while another two had been modified with legal bump-stock devices that allows semi-automatic guns to give full-auto fire of up to 800 rounds a minute. Several had scopes, and packed military-grade ammunition.
 
Paddock took 23 of those guns into his Mandalay Bay suite over several days and set up two rifles on tripods at windows overlooking the Route 91 Harvest country music festival. According to the Daily Mail, Thousands of rounds of ammunition were also found in the suite, enabling him to fire repeatedly over the course of 72 minutes. His car had several pounds of a fertilizer used in bomb-making.
 
A look outside his room via ABC:
 
 
And inside:
 
 
And, as we now learn, he also reportedly set up a camera in his room, apparently to film the mass murder, and others in the hallway to capture police arriving. Before carrying out the shooting, he used a hammer-like tool to smash out two window in his room which he used to fire out of.
 
 
Paddock had lived in 27 residences in Nevada, Florida and Texas as an adult, but other than that he had apparently lived a quiet and unremarkable life – and the reason for the most deadly assault in American history is still a mystery. Explanations have been offered for his motive, but law enforcement has
 remained coy. It has been suggested debts, a relationship collapse, or
 his family history may have contributed to the his drive to kill.
 
The retired accountant had worked as an internal auditor at Lockheed Martin for three years in the late 1980s, and was a manager and investor in apartment complexes located in Mesquite, Texas and California, which made him millions, his brother said, according to the Las Vegas Sun. A federal spokeswoman he worked as letter carrier, IRS agent for nearly a decade in 1970s and ’80s
 
Local police said they had no run-ins with the man, not even traffic violations, and his brother described him as ‘just a guy who lived in Mesquite who drove down and gambled in Las Vegas and… liked burritos’. So the discovery that he had used 10 suitcases to methodically move an arsenal up into his Mandalay Bay room over the preceding weekend came as a shock to those who knew him.
 
Eric Paddock said he thought his brother was far from a gun fanatic. ‘He had a couple of guns but they were all handgun, legal… he might have had one long gun, but he had them in a safe,’ he said. He said he didn’t know about the 23 guns that were found in the hotel room.
 
 
Speaking to the WSJ, a law enforcement source said that they found at least one fully automatic rifle among the batch, which included AR-15-style rifles and AK-47-style rifles. As we reported this morning, it also later emerged that two other semi-auto guns had been legally modified with bump-stocks that allow them to function like fully automatic rifles, pumping out 400-800 bullets a minute.
 
Among the weapons found in the room were four Daniel Defense DDM4 rifles, three FN-15s and other rifles made by Sig Sauer. A handgun was also found.
 
 
Four DDM4 rifles were among the 23 weapons found in Paddock’s hotel room.
 
 
Three FN-15 rifles, as well as guns made by Sig Sauer, were found in his arsenal.
 
 A Colt AR-15 was also found in the room
 
 Stephen Paddock’s room was packed with 23 guns and lots of ammo
 
Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo said on Monday it wasn’t clear whether the full-auto gun was modified, or if it was originally made that way. He also said that the ammunition ranged in size from .308, usually used in hunting rifles, to .223, associated with AR-15s and other assault rifles – the latter being military-grade, the New York Daily News reported.
 
Eric said the revelation of his brother’s deadly plan, which saw thousands of rounds falling on a crowd of 22,000 people at a music festival below, was as unexpected as seeing a meteor suddenly landing on his street.
 
The shocks only grew in number Monday as police raided two of Paddock’s properties. The first was his Mesquite home in a sleepy retirement community, which he purchased for just over $369,000 in 2015 according to public records.
 
 He lived at the $400,000 property (pictured with crumpled garage door after police raid) with Danley
 
Some 19 additional firearms were in the house, along with the explosive Tannerite – which is used to make explosive targets for target practice – and several thousand rounds of ammunition, Lombardo said Monday. He added that electronic devices were also found, but that they are still being examined to determine their purpose. Photos of the property showed the garage door torn off its hinge and crumpled after the search.
 
Police also found the fertilizer ammonium nitrate – which can be used to make bombs – in Paddock’s car in Las Vegas on Monday.
 
A SWAT team also raided a second property owned by Paddock in Reno on Monday. Bomb experts were on hand, due to concerns over booby traps. Police have not yet revealed what, if anything, they found there. Speaking on Monday evening, police said that the scene was still being examined by detectives.
 
Although ISIS have repeatedly attempted to claim credit for the shooting, saying Paddock had recently converted to Islam, both his brother and authorities have dismissed the claims. He had ‘no religious affiliation, no political affiliation,’ Eric said, adding: ‘He just hung out.’
 
He also had no Army training, nor expressed any particular interest in guns, Eric added – though he admitted that, as he lives in Florida, he had not spoken much with his brother over the last year. ‘His life is an open book. It’s all in public record,’ he said. ‘Once again, there is nothing. He went to college. He had a job.’
 
Paddock had both hunting and fishing licenses according to public records, as well as his pilot’s license, but no criminal record in the state of Nevada. Only his gambling habit stood out as unusual; Stephen would play $100 hands of video poker, and ‘once texted me a picture that he won $40,000 on a slot machine,’ Eric said. Neighbors at one of his properties in Florida said that they had barely talked to him – that he gave them keys to check on the property, and would only turn up every three months or so. When he did, they said, he would rarely be seen because he stayed up late at night playing poker online.
 
Law enforcement officials said that in recent weeks he had made a number of transactions in Las Vegas that were in the tens of thousands of dollars. On some days he spent more than $30,000, and on others more than $20,000, according to an individual who had seen Paddock’s Multiple Currency Transaction Reports. It’s not known whether he made money back on any recent bets, or lost it.
 
In his private life, Paddock enjoyed country shows on the Las Vegas Strip – such as the one he eventually attacked. Paddock’s time in Las Vegas wasn’t totally without event, however; in 2012 he filed a lawsuit against Cosmopolitan Hotels & Resorts following an incident that occurred at their Las Vegas casino. Paddock spent two years in court fighting his case after submitting his initial complaint citing ‘Negligence – Premises Liability.’
 
It was ultimately dismissed with prejudice in late 2014, and exact details of the case were not available on the Clark County Courts website.
 
Paddock was also the son of Benjamin Hoskins Paddock, a serial bank robber who ended up on the FBI Most Wanted list back in 1969 when he escaped from federal prison in Texas while serving a 20 years sentence. The FBI kept him on the list for the next eight years, and he was eventually found one year after he was removed from the list in 1978 while outside an Oregon Bingo hall. The agency said that the fugitive had been ‘diagnosed as psychopathic’ and also had possible ‘suicidal tendencies.’
 
The attack ended when the police breached the door to his room on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort just after 10pm on Sunday night, by which time Paddock had committed suicide. The result is shown in the photo below.
 
 
Finally, as the Star reports, the shooter may have left a suicide message: a note left by the gunman may offer clues to his reasons for slaughtering country music fans at the Route 91 Harvest Festival. The police have repeatedly said investigations are ongoing and have yet to make public any details.

The answer is yes.
The recent news that Amazon is giving refunds to huge numbers of people who fear they might have bought fake glasses for viewing the solar eclipse has thrown a spotlight on the fact that Amazon is full of fake products. Have even a quick glance at the process – or rather the lack of one – that Amazon uses to vet sellers, and this will come as no surprise.
However, the rise of fake products on Amazon causes some confusion among free-market liberals like myself. I have no problem with people selling stuff, of course, and think they should be free to do so without government interference.
That said, I’m forced to admit that in some cases, government guidelines should be respected, and Amazon should do more to crack down on unscrupulous sellers.
This is especially true when it comes to items bought to be used with firearms. Amazon is full of “fake” – for which read “cheap Chinese copy” – holsters, ear protection, and even gunsmithing tools.
For a lot of products, buying cheaper Chinese copies of American-designed items is not a huge problem. After all, they are cheaper, and the majority of things we buy do not need to “perform” in hostile environments.
For gun accessories, however, things are different. Guns are, let us remember, inherently dangerous devices, and if your holster fails you run the risk of your weapon falling out, and shooting yourself in the leg. To take another example, the government mandates that protective hearing devices sold for shooting need an ANSI certificate. Without this, there is no way of knowing that the ear protection you are buying will actually protect you, and you could damage your hearing before you realize you have bought a fake.
The Scale Of The Problem
The scale of this problem is huge. Reliable numbers are hard to come by because of course, Amazon tries to keep it out of the public domain. However, some independent reports suggest that up to 70% of the items sold by third-party sellers on Amazon are fake. That’s right, 70%.
These items are typically bought on Chinese versions of Amazon, such as AliBaba, where Chinese knock-offs of Western brands are rife. Third-party sellers then list them on Amazon, sometimes with misleading descriptions that make them appear legitimate.
The problem has grown so large because a lot of these listings fall into a legal gray area. In outright copyright infringement is proven, then Amazon can take action and remove fake items. However, in many cases sellers are clever about listing fake items in ways that do not fall foul of copyright law. In these instances, Amazon can do nothing.
Amazon’s defense here is that they are merely facilitating people buying and selling products between themselves. In the absence of gross copyright violations, therefore, the responsibility for spotting fake products lies with the consumer. That’s you.
What Is To Be Done?
As I said above, stories like this create something of a moral quandary for me. I think that people should be free to buy and sell whatever they want, without the interference of the government. And, I have to admit, that right should extend to “fake” items.
Ultimately, I think that these poor-quality products should be allowed to compete with American-made ones. In that spirit, and though some people are calling for it, I do not think that Amazon should interfere in this matter.
This leaves us, the consumers, with the responsibility for spotting fake products, and not buying them. For most people, this should not be too difficult, because there are a few key things to look out for.
The first, pretty obviously, is the price. If a product is listed on Amazon for 50% of the price it normally retails at, it is probably a Chinese copy. If a seller has a low rating, which on Amazon means less than 3.5 stars, then it’s likely they have had complaints in the past. Also look out for the seller’s name – if they are listed as “generic”, and not the name of the company who produces the item, they could be a fake seller.
Of course, my belief in the free market also extends to you, the buyer. You are free to buy these “fake” items if you like, and for some people, the reduced cost of them can make them a legitimate option. I would just say that, when buying accessories for shooting, respect the fact that you are using a deadly weapon, and buy your accessories accordingly.

2832,Commonwealth Games 2022: Birmingham bid 'not fully compliant',"Weightlifting would be held at Birmingham's Symphony Hall under the city's plans
The deadline for bids to host the 2022 Commonwealth Games has been extended after Birmingham's application was judged to be ""not fully compliant"".
Birmingham was the only bidder before the original 30 September deadline.
Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia, Victoria in Canada and a potential Australian entry had been thought to be possible bidders but none came forward.
Now Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) president Louise Martin has announced a new deadline of 30 November.
Durban originally won the bidding process in 2015, but the South African city was stripped of the event in March because it did not meet the criteria set by the CGF.
Martin congratulated Birmingham on a ""comprehensive"" application, but said more time should be given to assess plans.
While she did not indicate what might be missing from the English bid in its current state, the CGF is thought to want more information on government support, and the athletes' village.
""We have carefully reviewed the bids and updates received as part of the ongoing 2022 candidate city process and have agreed - noting the challenging timescales and no fully compliant bid - that further time should be given to all interested parties to enable the submission of fully compliant proposals,"" she said.
Birmingham beat Liverpool in September to be Britain's candidate city and its bid has been backed by the government.
Commonwealth Games England chief executive Paul Blanchard said he remained confident the West Midlands city has the ability to host the event.
""It was a huge effort to put such a comprehensive bid together in such a short timescale,"" he said.
""We've always said that even though Birmingham was the only city to submit a bid there would still be a few hurdles to clear before a decision was made on formally awarding the Games.""
Media playback is not supported on this device 'Commonwealth Games in my home city would be amazing'
The cost of staging the event is expected to be at least £750m, which would be the most expensive sports event in Britain since the London 2012 Olympics.
Describing its plan as a ""compelling and low-risk bid"", a Birmingham 2022 spokesperson said: ""We expected a period of discussion and negotiation with the CGF following submission and we await further clarification from the CGF about the next steps.""
Birmingham's proposal to create the UK's largest permanent athletics stadium, supplemented by four indoor arenas, is central to its bid.
Liverpool mayor Joe Anderson questioned the government's decision to back the Birmingham bid.
""Our bid was compliant, so there are definitely questions to be asked of DCMS (Department of Culture, Media and Sport) about how a non-compliant bid was allowed to be submitted,"" he told the Liverpool Echo.
""This was the government's chosen bid for the international competition and we always believed that Liverpool's transformational and exciting bid would be more successful at that level with the Commonwealth Games Federation.""
Analysis
BBC sports editor Dan Roan
The federation's decision to reopen the 2022 bidding process has caused surprise and embarrassment within government - and the Birmingham 2022 team - both of whom believed they had done everything asked of them, but have now been told their bid is not compliant.
It is understood that Games bosses want further assurances over government guarantees and that land for the athletes' village has been secured, but some observers will wonder why such issues were not ironed out before the bid was submitted. Others feel this is just a means of attracting a second bidder, and give the process some much-needed credibility.
Either way, most insiders still seem confident that Birmingham will end up hosting the Games in 2022, despite the latest twist.

The best way to describe the win over JAX is an ugly, entertaining roller coaster ride. The Jet OLine was the major factor in this physical, “phone booth” game let’s take a look:
– A scrappy, feisty and resilient effort because there were plenty of opportunities to hang their heads. Is this team developing an identity?
– Have we seen the last of Matt Forte? With the dynamic performances of Bilal Powell and Elijah McGuire can the coaching staff really take reps away from them and give them to a 31 year old RB? What a pleasure to have RB’s that are always a threat to break off 50+ yard runs.
– Excellent game by the entire OLine as they dominated the JAX front and generated over 200 yards on the ground. Don’t let the sack stats fool you, at least 2-3 of those were because Josh McCown held the ball too long. And don’t forget Brent Qvale was subbing for Brandon Shell, credit to Steve Marshall (OLine coach) for having the backups ready to play.
– David Bass with another excellent game as he continued to bring edge pressure. He had a sack a TFL and did a good job setting the edge in the run game. Lorenzo Mauldin needs to take note as he recovers on IR.
– Kony Ealy with a huge impact game as he had 4 pass blocks and an INT that set up a FG.
– Leonard Williams with a nice game clogging up the run lanes and breaking down JAX OLine schemes multiple times.
– Josh McCown ended up with good “game manager” stats but he has to show better decision making. He held the ball too long on a number of occasions which led to sacks. And to me the scoop & score that made it 20-17 was his fault because he rushed the pass to Powell. After the 40+ yard bomb to Robby Anderson there was no need to rush the next play. Be conservative and run the clock there was no way Blake Bortles was going to generate two scores in the 4th quarter.
– Lachlan Edwards with a rollercoaster ride of a game. The lows were the short punt in OT that put JAX on the edge of FG range. And not being aware at the end of the first half that he needed to be on the field for the FG attempt which led to a delay of game penalty. Edwards was celebrating one of his highs, the fake punt pass as the clock was ticking down. The other high was the 70 yard punt which pinned JAX back inside the 5 yard line.
– Props to Chandler Catanzaro for the game winning FG but you can’t miss the kick at the end of the first half.
– Good follow up game by Demario Davis as he continued to be physical and laid some serious licks on Chris Ivory & Leonard Fournette.
– The self-inflicted wounds have to be eliminated because this team isn’t good enough to overcome them on a regular basis. Penalties in FG range, holding the ball too long for sacks and not being aware that you’re needed on the field can’t happen.
– Robby Anderson was relatively quiet because of the excellent play by AJ Bouye & Jalen Ramsey. But his speed is ridiculous because on the 40 yard bomb he torched Bouye with a simple stutter move.
– Blake Bortles stinks and his coaching staff knows it. They play around him hoping he doesn’t screw up the game.
– The Jets should send Marquise Lee a game ball as he had a huge drop in OT. And he then mishandled Edwards punt which put them inside the 10 yard line.

CycleBar Westgate West will host Ride for Isla, a charity ride to benefit the Osteogenesis Imperfecta Foundation, on Oct. 7.
San Jose, CA, October 03, 2017 — CycleBar Westgate West will host Ride for Isla, a charity ride to benefit the Osteogenesis Imperfecta Foundation, on Oct. 7.
The 50-minute ride will be held at noon Saturday, Oct. 7 at CycleBar Westgate West with CycleStar instructor Pegah Olfat.
Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) is a genetic bone disorder characterized by fragile bones that break easily. It is also known as “brittle bone disease.” The term literally means “bone that is imperfectly made from the beginning of life.” A person is born with this disorder and is affected throughout his or her lifetime.
Pegah is also the sponsor of the ride. Her best friend’s daughter Isla was diagnosed with Type V OI in July. There are eight types of OI and Type V is the rarest.
“Because there are fewer than 20,000 US cases per year, this disease is considered very rare,” said Olfat. “Please Ride for Isla and your donations will go to further research for Osteogensis Imperfecta!”

2995,"Special Report: In Kim Jong Un's summer palace, fun meets guns","SEOUL (Reuters) - In the seaside city of Wonsan, North Korean families cook up barbecues on the beach, go fishing, and eat royal jelly flavor ice cream in the summer breeze. For their leader Kim Jong Un, the resort is a summer retreat, a future temple to tourism, and a good place to test missiles.
He is rebuilding the city of 360,000 people and wants to turn it into a billion-dollar tourist hotspot. At the same time, he has launched nearly 40 missiles from the area, as part of his accelerated tests of North Korea’s nuclear deterrent.
“It may sound crazy to outsiders to fire missiles from a place he wants to develop economically, but that’s how Kim Jong Un runs his country,” said Lim Eul-chul, an expert on the North Korean economy at Kyungnam University in South Korea.
This combination of tourism and nuclear weapons is emblematic of Kim Jong Un’s strategy for survival, say researchers and people familiar with the project.
North Korea’s development plans for Wonsan have mushroomed since they were first announced in 2014. Examined here in detail for the first time, they run across 160 pages in nearly 30 brochures produced by the Wonsan Zone Development Corporation in Korean, Chinese, Russian and English in 2015 and 2016.
Tourism is one of a shrinking range of North Korean cash sources not targeted by United Nations sanctions, and the brochures advertise to foreign investors some $1.5 billion worth of potential ventures in the Wonsan Special Tourist Zone, an area covering more than 400 square km (150 square miles). Kim has already constructed a ski resort and a new airport there.
According to one brochure, the Zone includes approximately 140 historical relics, 10 sand beaches, 680 tourist attractions, four mineral springs, several bathing resorts and natural lakes and “more than 3.3 million tons of mud with therapeutic properties for neuralgia and colitis.”
The projects that Kim is inviting investors to help build include a $7.3 million department store, a $197 million city center development, and a $123 million golf course (including a $62.5 million fee to lease the land).
Earlier this year Kim sent 16 of his officials to Spain to get ideas for Wonsan. They visited Marina d‘Or, one of the Mediterranean country’s biggest holiday complexes, and the Terra Mitica (Mythical Land) theme park in Benidorm. Terra Mitica caters to fans “of extreme sensations,” according to its website.
“They saw such places with their own eyes and filmed some of them,” said a spokesman at the North Korean embassy in Madrid. Both parks confirmed the visits; a spokeswoman for Terra Mitica said the North Koreans were impressed by its themes including the ancient civilizations of Egypt, Greece and Rome.
No major foreign partner has said they will back Kim’s Wonsan projects. The new airport, completed in 2015, has yet to open to international flights. America recently banned its citizens from visiting North Korea. International sanctions now ban all joint ventures with the state.
Even so, the plan is strategically vital for Kim, say former North Korean diplomats. When he came to power in 2011, he inherited a society officially run by the military but whose people survived largely on black market dealings. On paper, North Korea is a state-run economy; but in fact, seven in 10 North Koreans depend on private trade to live, according to Thae Yong Ho, North Korea’s former deputy ambassador in London, who staged a high-profile defection with his family in 2016.
Kim is perceived by outsiders as all powerful, but North Korea’s free marketeers make him more vulnerable than he seems, Thae told Reuters. The leader is looking for a way to harness both military and market forces to survive.
Nuclear weapons are one part of his answer – because Kim hopes they will cost less to maintain than North Korea’s conventional heavy weapons. Projects like Wonsan are the other part. He wants to cut the share of funding he gives to the military and allocate more money to the civilian economy.
“Kim Jong Un knows that he can only control society and guarantee his long leadership if his role and influence in the economy is increased,” said Thae.
“FRIENDLY”
North Korea wants to attract more than 1 million tourists every year in the near term and around 5 million to 10 million tourists “in the foreseeable future,” the Wonsan brochures say. The Wonsan Zone Development Corporation, the North Korean state body which oversees the project, did not respond to requests for comment.
There are no up-to-date statistics on current visitors to North Korea. China said more than 237,000 Chinese visited in 2012 but it stopped publishing the statistics in 2013. For comparison, 8 million Chinese visited South Korea in 2016.
The Korea Maritime Institute, a think-tank in the South, estimates that tourism generates about $44 million in annual revenue for North Korea – about 0.8 percent of the country’s GDP. About 80 percent of all North Korea’s foreign tourists are Chinese, it says. Westerners and Russians make up the rest.
Related Coverage North Korea's unhappy mix of tourists and military
The Wonsan brochures are welcoming. “Officials and residents of this zone have a good understanding of tourism and are friendly toward tourists,” one says.
The brochures also disclose some unusual details about vacation habits in the totalitarian state.
Not far from the proposed $123 million golf course, the plans show an existing compound. It is labeled in the brochure as the summer retreat of the State Security Department or “Bowibu” – the entity which runs North Korea’s six prison camps and conducts nationwide surveillance of ordinary citizens.
Just next door to that beachfront property, the Daesong General Bureau – the body also known as “Office 39” that procures luxury goods for the Kim family – has its retreat.
A third compound is reserved for the Korean National Insurance Corporation, a state insurance company that the European Union says is involved in insurance fraud.
All three entities are subject to international sanctions because of their role in funneling cash into Kim’s nuclear and missile programs.
For Kim’s security forces, though, Wonsan is about more than fun in the sun.
Kim brought his top military brass to Wonsan in 2014. On the white sandy beach of his palace compound, he ordered his highest admirals to strip into bathing costumes and, as a test of their ability, swim 10 km around the bay, state TV showed. It filmed him at a desk on the sand, shaded by a white parasol.
In April this year, Kim used the beach near Wonsan’s new airport to unleash an artillery drill described by state media as the country’s largest ever. In it, “300 large-caliber self-propelled guns” opened fire at a white target painted on a small island 3 km away.
The bombardment, broadcast on state TV, turned that island into a dusty moonscape.

PLASTIC FLOWERS
Wonsan holds symbolic power for the Kim dynasty: It was there that Kim Jong Un’s grandfather Kim Il Sung, who helped found North Korea at the end of Japanese colonial rule in 1945, first landed with Soviet troops to take over the country.
Statues of North Korea’s two former leaders stand on the quayside, where tourists are expected to bow and buy plastic flowers to offer them. Next door to the Kim family palace, the Songdowon Children’s Camp has welcomed “Young Pioneers” from Soviet-backed countries for decades, according to state media.
When the young Kim was picked as heir to Kim Jong Il in 2009, he had few achievements to his name, noted Kim Young-Hui, who heads a team of North Korea researchers at Korea Development Bank in Seoul. If he can develop Wonsan – the place where his grandfather helped bring North Korea into existence – it will seal his image as a master builder.
“He has strong political reasons to develop Wonsan,” she said. She is a native of the city and defected to South Korea in 2002.
People from Wonsan, even those who have defected, say they have largely happy memories of the place. Wonsan’s karaoke bars and billiard clubs have a more reliable supply of electricity than much of North Korea, they say. They recall young couples roller skating in a big square near the Wonsan waterfront.
The city has a special place in Kim’s heart, says Michael Spavor, a Canadian consultant who shared Long Island Iced Teas with Kim on board one of his private boats in 2013, after they had been jet-skiing in the bay.
“He told me about ... redeveloping and improving the whole city for the people and ... attracting international tourists and businessmen to the area,” said Spavor, who runs the Paektu Cultural Exchange, which conducts economic research in North Korea.
“NO BELT-TIGHTENING”
Official history has not disclosed Kim’s birthplace, but many people from Wonsan believe he was born there, partly because he spent his early years at the palace.
Slideshow (29 Images)
An anecdote from that time gives a flavor of life inside the Kim family residence. One day, the Japanese family chef, Kenji Fujimoto, recounted in his memoirs, the future leader made an unusual remark.
“Hey, Fujimoto!” a young Kim said to the chef. “We ride horses every day, go rollerblading, play basketball, and in the summer we jet ski or play in the pool. But how do ordinary people live?” Fujimoto, who published the book in 2010, now runs a sushi restaurant in Pyongyang and could not be reached.
For years under Kim Jong Il, North Korea, backed by the Soviet Union and China, had officially provided everything for its people.
The political model then was known as “songun” – military first, which held that the Korean People’s Army was the first in line for resources and the infallible provider to fix the country’s economic problems. The “million-man army” would swap Kalashnikovs for shovels and set to work building roads, dams and housing.
After the Soviet Union collapsed in the 1990s, the entire nation, then 21 million people, suffered a famine that Kim Jong Il was eventually to call the “Arduous March.” The state was no longer able to provide food, or work. Between 200,000 and three million people died.
To survive, ordinary people were forced to look beyond the marshaled ranks on display at parades, and hustle for scraps on private markets, bribing officials to turn a blind eye to any illegality. For most people – including the military – it was hunger or trade.
When Kim the younger came to power, he said the time had come to “enable our people... to live without tightening their belts any longer.”
In 2013, he shifted the political rhetoric. His policy line, called “byungjin” or parallel development, harked back to his grandfather’s era. It also signaled the side-by-side advance of North Korea’s nuclear deterrent and a strong economy.
MAKE MONEY IN WONSAN
The latest available figures say North Korea spends a bigger share of its GDP on the military than any country in the world – an average of 23 percent between 2004 and 2014, according to the U.S. State Department.
The Wonsan brochures promise healthy profits, including internal rates of return of between 14 percent and 43 percent. The $7.3 million Wonsan Department Store, for example, allows for foreign investors to hold a stake of up to 61.3 percent. In return, it says, investors can expect to make $1.3 million net annual profit.
The brochures offer preferential conditions for foreign investors, saying their rights are protected by the state and they can remit funds abroad without any limitations. Land is available to them to lease, not to own, for 50 years, but investors can trade the leases.
Some of the projects are less generous. One offers the opportunity to cash in on the popularity of North Korean beer with an initial $2.4 million investment in a new Wonsan Brewery. The proposal says foreign investors will be subject to a 15 percent transaction tax, a city management tax, an auto tax, plus other deductions. Then there is income tax at 14 percent. These deductions will nearly halve the projected annual profit, to $154,711.
For domestic investors North Korea officially has no tax, but experts say the state raises funds by collecting about 70 percent of the profits of state enterprises.
A few of the proposals stretch the idea of tourism. They include an Offshore Farm to produce seafoods “of great economic value on an industrial basis, so as to satisfy the demands of tourists and export the products to the foreign market,” a lighting factory, a furniture factory, and a renovated Wonsan Fishing Tackle factory. Its output will include 10,000 deep sea floats, 750 tonnes of ropes and 2,500 “lifesaving jackets for swimming.”
Since the plans were drawn up, the United Nations has tightened sanctions on North Korea to include a ban on seafood exports and curbs on joint ventures.
According to a brochure from 2015, foreign investor interest in the Wonsan project was “growing day by day.”
But a Westerner who attended an investment conference in Wonsan in 2015 said North Korean officials showed little understanding of investors’ needs. About 200 people, Chinese and Westerners, heard about investment prospects in the zone and were taken on a tour of the area.
“I thought I might be a witness to some actual pragmatism,” said Simon Cockerell of Beijing-based Koryo Tours. “But they simply went on about how amazing the opportunities were and couldn’t admit any weaknesses or that there may be any issues at all with the area or any of their plans.”
Han Jin-myung, a North Korean diplomat who was stationed in Vietnam until 2015 before defecting to South Korea, said he had been tasked with promoting the Wonsan scheme abroad and had little success: “We just ended up selling North Korean herbs and medicines instead.”",fake

63,"Disney, Hillary Clinton and the Obamas Condemn Weinstein","Former President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, also released a statement about Mr. Weinstein, saying that “any man who demeans and degrades women in such fashion needs to be condemned and held accountable, regardless of wealth or status.” The Obamas’ older daughter, Malia, was an intern at the Weinstein Company this year.

The Weinstein Company’s board said in a statement on Tuesday that it was “shocked and dismayed” by the allegations. “These alleged actions are antithetical to human decency,” the board said. One-third of the company’s all-male board had resigned on Friday.
Also on Tuesday, Georgina Chapman, Mr. Weinstein’s wife, told People magazine that she was leaving him. And the University of Southern California’s School of Cinematic Arts said it had decided to reject his earlier pledge to fund a $5 million endowment for female filmmakers.
Mr. Eisner and Jeffrey Katzenberg, who was then in charge of Disney’s movie divisions, bought Miramax in 1993 for $80 million. At the time, Miramax was becoming a superpower in the art film business by turning offbeat, inexpensive movies into mainstream hits. It was in 1992, for instance, that Miramax released the micro-budgeted thriller “The Crying Game,” which collected $62 million at the box office, or $110 million in today’s dollars.
On Tuesday, Mr. Katzenberg released an email that he sent to Mr. Weinstein on Sunday and that said he was “sickened” by the allegations. “There appear to be two Harvey Weinsteins … one that I have known well, appreciated and admired and another that I have not known at all,” Mr. Katzenberg’s email said.

Robert A. Iger, Disney’s current chief executive, said in a separate statement, “Harvey Weinstein’s reported behavior is abhorrent and unacceptable, and it has no place in our society.” Disney sold Miramax in 2010 for $660 million.
The flurry of comments came five days after a New York Times investigation chronicled a hidden history of sexual harassment allegations against Mr. Weinstein, including settlements paid, often involving former employees, over three decades. On Sunday, the Weinstein Company fired him, citing “new information about misconduct by Harvey Weinstein.”
In response to the allegations, Mr. Weinstein has acknowledged that his behavior “caused a lot of pain.” But a spokeswoman, Sallie Hofmeister, also said he “unequivocally denied” any allegations of nonconsensual sex.
Disney’s purchase of Miramax included provisions that shielded Miramax from corporate interference. The Weinsteins were given the ability to “greenlight” films with budgets of tens of millions of dollars without approval from Disney. Miramax also got to retain its own chief financial officer, head of human relations and general counsel.
According to reports at the time, the brothers demanded the autonomy, arguing that their films — which would include rough-and-rowdy titles like “Pulp Fiction,” released in 1994 — could not be incubated inside a corporate environment.
While with Disney, Miramax released more than 300 movies, which generated $5 billion in North American ticket sales and tallied at least 220 Academy Award nominations and 53 wins, including best picture Oscars for “Shakespeare in Love,” “The English Patient” and “Chicago.”

But Disney also clashed bitterly with the Weinsteins, who took advantage of their autonomy to start an expensive magazine, Talk, without approval and to move forward with the political documentary “Fahrenheit 9/11” despite being told that Disney would not distribute it. At the time, executives at Disney said Miramax had hidden its financing of that film by not including it on monthly reports about films in development; Miramax officials countered that they were aboveboard.",fake

845,Seeing India Through a Contemporary Lens,"He took as much from the West as he did from traditional India. He was deeply versed in the devices of modernist photographers, especially Mr. Friedlander’s, in which foreground elements, such as poles and trees, and reflective surfaces, such as shop windows and plate-glass doorways, are employed to fragment the image and convey the jumbled sensations of life.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
In his street photography, though, there is a telling difference from the pictures of Mr. Winogrand or Robert Frank. The American photographers depicted crowds of atomized individuals. When Singh looked about him in India, he found intimate moments of human interaction — a boy carrying a baby, a barber cutting a client’s hair — within the wider flux of teeming humanity. “What was amazing in the last decade of Raghubir’s life was the modern vision he developed, with such a deep understanding of India, which was in his blood,” said Ketaki Sheth, one of the younger Indian photographers whom Singh mentored.
Sometimes, Singh’s photographs function as commentary. A picture taken outside the former Victoria Terminus in Mumbai (then Bombay) shows men in jeans and chinos hurrying to work, while in the foreground a vendor is holding a mosquito net that frames a view of its imposing stone lion. “To me, it is a complete sentence — all the men are in Western dress and they think they are catching the British lion in a mosquito net,” said Ilan Averbuch, a sculptor who was a close friend of Singh’s. A photograph of a wrecked truck and an oblivious cowherd recalls the Bruegel painting of the fall of Icarus, about which W. H. Auden wrote a famous poem; but unlike Bruegel’s disaster, which unfolds as a speck in the sky, Singh’s downed truck takes up more than a third of the frame, pushing up to the picture plane and dwarfing the man and his cattle. In India, catastrophe is always in your face, but it can be — must be — sidestepped.
In his final completed project, on the boxy Ambassador car that was ubiquitous during the period he traveled in India, the doors, windows and rearview mirrors of the vehicles divide and complicate the image. “His work became more abstract,” said Gwen Darien, an art historian and patient-rights advocate who was his partner during the last year of his life. At the time of his death, he was about to travel to Chicago, where his first American museum retrospective had just opened at the Art Institute of Chicago. “I think he was at a significant turning point,” Ms. Darien said. “It was a new place of his engagement with other photographers and the public. It is so heartbreaking that that was the moment when he died.”
One of his last, unfinished projects was a series of what we now call selfies in different settings. Mr. Roma said he thought these self-portraits differ in motivation from the well-known self-portraits of Mr. Friedlander (who is Mr. Roma’s father-in-law). “Lee is projecting himself on the landscape,” he said. “Raghubir was almost doing the opposite, projecting the landscape onto himself.” Singh was contemplating the impressions left on him by the many places he happened to visit, and the singular place from which he hailed. “He always claimed that he was shaped by Rajasthan,” said Akeel Bilgrami, a professor of philosophy at Columbia University. A 1998 self-portrait in Rajasthan illustrates that. Bespectacled and quizzical, Singh fills much of the frame, but he is out of focus. The courtyard and servant in the traditional house behind him are rendered sharp and clear.",fake

2543,Grand Final 2017: Leeds Rhinos' journey from relegation danger to Old Trafford glory,"Media playback is not supported on this device McGuire stars as Leeds make Grand Final history
How quickly the mighty can fall. And how quickly they can rise again.
Shortly after Leeds Rhinos had registered a record eighth Grand Final win by beating Castleford Tigers 24-6 on Saturday, Brian McDermott was asked whether it was the best of his four Old Trafford triumphs as Leeds head coach.
""I'm not sure about it being the best Grand Final win, but it's the best story,"" he replied.
""This win is not the coaches' win or the players' win. This win is for the club.""
The reason? For that, you have to start by going back to the 2015 Grand Final.
A domestic treble was completed with victory over Wigan, the Rhinos becoming only the second team to achieve the feat in the Super League era - a fitting finale for three club legends, Kevin Sinfield, Jamie Peacock and Kylie Leuluai.
Starting again without that experienced trio in 2016 proved even trickier than some onlookers imagined and a wretched run of form early in the season left champions Leeds outside the top eight after 23 games, contemplating the unthinkable.
""The media would be asking all sorts of questions and they aren't easy questions to answer,"" said McDermott. ""Sometimes I'd pinch myself and think: 'Am I really answering questions about relegation?'""
The Qualifiers were negotiated successfully, meaning Leeds would take their place among the elite again in 2017.
'Difficult conversations' after thumping at Cas
Then came another low point.
Castleford thrashed Leeds 66-10 in their fourth match of the season and, in the aftermath, chief executive Gary Hetherington sent out an open letter to supporters.
""We are not stubborn enough to believe no change is always the best option,"" it read.
""This month is an important one with games against Catalans, Wakefield, Huddersfield and Wigan, and at its end we will be in a much better position to make an accurate judgement on the performance of all our players, coaching staff and senior management, including myself.""
McDermott said publicly that he was in agreement with the timing and the content of the letter.
He recalled: ""When we got pumped by Cas, I spent all weekend on the phone to Gary.
""He was asking what we were were going to do, saying this wasn't good after 2016 and we needed answers - and they're not easy conversations to have.
""The board, the fans and people outside the club will have asked questions and wanted answers, but the answer always was to calm down, not flap and hold your nerve.
""I had a really difficult conversation with [captain] Danny McGuire as well and I don't think either of us got it right - but the answer was to hold your nerve.""
How did the Rhinos respond? By winning all four of those aforementioned games.
""I've said it a few times since I've been at Leeds - all the staff members give you a thumbs up all the time, no matter how bad it gets,"" added McDermott, who has been in charge since 2011.
""The level of support from everybody at Leeds has been strong this year. That's why the club owns the Grand Final win.""
'Strong group' secure Old Trafford success
Danny McGuire and Rob Burrow lifted the Super League trophy in their final game for Leeds
Leeds ended the season second in Super League, 10 points behind runaway league leaders Cas.
However, the Rhinos always seem to come good at the end of a campaign - and so it has proved again.
It was far from a classic Grand Final on a wet night in Manchester, but Leeds were the better side and deservedly gave departing veterans Danny McGuire and Rob Burrow the perfect farewell.
""We've had so many big moments as a club when we've had to hold our nerve,"" said McDermott.
""To get the Grand Final is an achievement. To win it - that's when I get lost for words, it's crazy. And not just win it by a wafer-thin margin - I thought we were pretty dominant.
""When a group of people go through so many emotions together like we have over the past 18 months, you become a very strong group.
""Castleford have been more skilful than us this year, they've put in better shows than us - but I'd question anyone who'd say they've had more commitment than us, certainly towards the back end of the season.
""Grand Finals are won on many different facets, and one of them is a sheer bloody-mindedness not to lose.""",fake
301,"North Korean ship loaded with 30,000 grenades seized by US en-route to Egypt","More than 30,000 rocket-propelled grenades have been discovered on board a freighter named the Jie Shun, bound from North Korea to Egypt where it was to be accepted by shadowy ‘business’ figures in the North African country.
 
The enormous weapons haul was uncovered after the United States received intelligence that a massive shipment of grenades was traveling from North Korea to Egypt under Cambodian colors. Intelligence services working for the United States warned the Egyptian government about the ship, and their law enforcement agents sprang into action. They claim that the weapons haul had been hidden discreetly underneath huge bins of iron ore within the bowels of the ship.
 
A swiftly executed investigation which was led by the United Nations found that the weapons had been sent from Pyongyang as part of a deal with Egyptian business executives who had ordered millions of dollars’ worth of cheap weaponry from the hermit kingdom.
 
Representatives from the United States have accused the Egyptian government and law enforcement agencies of turning a blind eye deliberately to the nefarious transaction. They have claimed that the Egyptians failed to act until they were prompted by the US intelligence services to intercept the ship and confiscate the cargo. This is a claim that the Egyptian Embassy in Washington has fervently denied, claiming that the country had been completely transparent throughout the entire event and that “Egypt will continue to abide by all Security Council resolutions and will always be in conformity with these resolutions as they restrain military purchases from North Korea.” Despite the protestations of the Egyptian government, the United States does not appear to believe them and has halted and delayed £224million ($300million) in military aid to the country in response.
 
According to David Thompson, who is a senior analyst and an investigator for the Centre for Advanced Defence Studies in Washington claimed that North Korea has been using the funds accrued from these kinds of weapons shipments to finance the country’s highly controversial nuclear ambitions. In the past, it is known that North Korea has done similar deals with countries such as Iran, Burma, Cuba and at least two different international terrorist organizations. The country has also been known to finance itself in the past by drug trafficking and recent reports also suggest that agents for Pyongyang have been involved in the wide-scale theft of bitcoin.
 
It is not known whether North Korea received the money promised to them by the Egyptian business executives for the weapons shipment. According to experts, the hermit kingdom has been particularly desperate for funds in the past couple of months owing to the fresh raft of UN sanctions against the country and the potential of a full-scale conflict with the United States looming on the horizon.

683,Progressive Mayor of San Juan Turns Recovery Effort Political,"Progressive Mayor of San Juan Turns Recovery Effort Political
(Before It's News)
By Rich Mitchell
The liberal mayor of San Juan, Puerto Rico, Carmen Cruz, this week turned the massive recovery effort in her state into a political opportunity.
CDN – http://www.conservativedailynews.com
Cruz said on Friday that she wanted to “make sure somebody is in charge that is up to the task of saving lives” after FEMA asked her to list her priorities so that they could properly direct aid. Her response is as expected from a progressive – a politically motivated, irresponsible display of someone with the inability to lead.
“Well, where have you been?” she exclaimed. “I have been very respectful of the FEMA employees. I have been patient but we have no time for patience anymore.” Although it is unclear how impatience helps considering the scope of the disaster due to the failure of local and state government to upgrade the infrastructure on the island in decades past.
President Donald Trump responded to Cruz, pointing out her lack of leadership.
“Such poor leadership ability by the Mayor of San Juan, and others in Puerto Rico, who are not able to get their workers to help,” he tweeted. The president pointed out that leaders like Cruz pound their desks and demand action instead of getting out into the community and encouraging it.
This kind of language has a negative effect on the community and the 10,000 federal and military members in the territory. It is important to encourage locals to get out and help with the recovery as many did when Hurricane Harvey submerged much of Houston, Texas. Vitriolic criticism is demoralizing and her comments are in direct opposition to the territory’s Governor who clearly understands that encouragement and hopefulness are more helpful than dramatic, desperate rants on television.
“We’re very pleased with the communication with the president, with the administration…we’re working as one team,” Governor Ricardo Rossello told CBS News.
The Trump administration’s latest action, waiving the Jones Act, came just hours after Puerto Rico’s governor requested it. While the waiver won’t improve the aid effort, it shows the responsiveness of the federal government to Puerto Rico’s needs.

990,Lilly's breast cancer drug fails to help lung patients,"(Reuters) - Eli Lilly and Co said its recently approved breast cancer drug failed to meet a late-stage trial’s main goal of improving overall survival in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.
The news comes as a blow to the drugmaker, which has suffered setbacks on two potential blockbuster treatments over the past year - the delay of a rheumatoid arthritis drug, as well as the failure of an experimental Alzheimer’s treatment.
A positive data in lung cancer patients would have given the drug, Verzenio, a competitive edge over rival breast cancer treatments such as Pfizer Inc’s Ibrance and Novartis AG Kisqali.
The drugmaker said on Tuesday that the late-stage trial was testing Verzenio in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer with mutation of the KRAS gene, whose cancer has progressed despite initial therapies.
The drug, whose chemical name is abemaciclib, was being compared with Roche’s erlotinib, sold under the brand name Tarceva.
Verzenio belongs to a newer class of oral medicines called CDK 4/6 inhibitors that block cancer cells’ ability to divide and proliferate.
Last month, the FDA approved the drug to treat advanced breast cancer that has progressed following prior treatment.
Verzenio, however, showed some evidence of improvement in the latest trial’s secondary goals such as progression-free survival in patients and overall response rate, Lilly said.
The company currently has several ongoing trials evaluating Verzenio in non-small cell lung cancer, including a combination trial with Keytruda or chemotherapy, and does not plan to discontinue them, Guggenheim analyst Tony Butler wrote in a client note.
Lung cancer is by far the largest oncology market in the United States with Merck & Co Inc’s Keytruda leading the space.
Keytruda is an immuno-oncology drug, which works by taking the brakes off the immune system and allowing the body’s natural killer cells to home in on tumors.
Lilly’s shares fell 1.2 percent to $85.99 in afternoon trade on Tuesday.
The company last month laid off 8 percent of its employees in order to save around $500 million a year and made significant changes to its management.",fake

1840,Brazil detains Italian fugitive Battisti leaving country,"Italian former leftist guerrilla Cesare Battisti leaves the headquarters of Federal Police in Sao Paulo March 13, 2015. REUTERS/Nacho Doce
BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian highway police on Wednesday detained Cesare Battisti, an Italian former left-wing guerrilla convicted of murder in his country, as he was attempting to cross the border into Bolivia in a taxi, federal police said.
Battisti was apparently trying to leave Brazil after Italy reportedly asked Brazil’s government to revoke his asylum status and extradite him to serve his prison sentence.
He was stopped by highway police as he was about to cross the border in a Bolivian taxi and was held for possession of a “significant” quantity of undeclared foreign currency, the federal police said in a statement.
Battisti faced life in prison in Italy, where he was convicted of four murders committed in the 1970s, when he belonged to a guerilla group called Armed Proletarians for Communism. He escaped from prison in 1981 and lived in France before fleeing to Brazil to avoid being extradited to Italy.
Battisti’s lawyer, Igor Sant‘Anna, told Reuters that he had sought a habeas corpus injunction last week due to the risk that President Michel Temer’s government could agree to Italy’s request. Habeas corpus is a legal procedure that keeps a government from holding a person without showing cause.
The police statement said he was being held for breaking currency rules.
O Globo newspaper reported last week that Italy had asked the Temer government to review the status of Battisti, who was granted refugee status by former leftist President Luis Inacio Lula da Silva on his last day in office in 2010.
Lula had refused an Italian extradition request, a decision that upset relations between the two countries.",fake

In a statement Friday, the board of the Weinstein Co. said, ""We strongly endorse Harvey Weinstein's already-announced decision to take an indefinite leave of absence from the Company, commencing today.""
The board said his return depends on his ""therapeutic progress,"" the outcome of an independent investigation and ""Harvey's own personal decisions.""
Bob Weinstein, Harvey Weinstein's brother and the company's co-founder, and COO David Glasser will run the company in Harvey Weinstein's absence.
""We take extremely seriously the accusations published in yesterday's New York Times about our Company's co-chairman Harvey Weinstein,"" the company's board said in a statement. ""It is essential to our Company's culture that all women who work for it or have any dealings with it or any of our executives are treated with respect and have no experience of harassment or discrimination.""
The statement was signed by the board of The Weinstein Company -- Robert Weinstein, Tarak Ben Ammar, Lance Maerov and Richard Koenigsberg.
The Weinstein Co. has retained John Kiernan of Debevoise & Plimpton LLP, to conduct an independent investigation into what the company called ""very serious accusations.""
Weinstein's suspension comes after The Times published an article Thursday that revealed the powerful film producer has faced several accusations of sexual harassment spanning nearly three decades.
Weinstein issued a statement in wake of the story in which he apologized for his behavior and announced he'd be taking a leave of absence to deal with the ""issue head on.""
""I cannot be more remorseful about the people I hurt and I plan to do right by all of them,"" Weinstein said on Thursday.

2856,Hurricanes take their toll on US jobs market,"Image copyright Getty Images
US employment fell in September for the first time since 2010 as hurricanes Harvey and Irma took their toll on the jobs market.
The Labor Department said 33,000 jobs were lost amid a record drop in employment in the leisure and hospitality sector.
It blamed the two storms, which struck Texas and Florida in late August and early September, for the slide.
Economists had expected a rise of 90,000 jobs last month.
However, Harvey and Irma did not affect the unemployment rate, which slipped to 4.2% - the lowest since February 2001.
The US Labor Department uses separate surveys to capture payrolls data and the unemployment rate.
Economists said the discrepancy between the two September reports suggests the jobs decline does not indicate a long-term trend.
Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial Services said: ""Although the headline number for September is loss of jobs, the first in seven years, the labour market remains in good shape.""
The strongest job gains last month came in health care and the transportation and warehousing industries.
But employment in the leisure and hospitality sector shrank significantly, while job figures in many other industries, including construction and government, were largely unchanged.

The US has been experiencing one of the longest stretches of job creation in its history, with the economy adding a monthly average of more than 170,000 over the past year.
Economists have said that pace is unsustainable and predicted it would slow. But the wage gains they said should accompany tightening in the labour market have been elusive.
The September report showed that average hourly earnings rose 0.5% from August and have now risen 2.9% over the past 12 months.
ThinkMarkets analyst Naeem Aslam said the earnings figure showed ""that job market slack is fading"".
Others said the figure was likely to have been skewed by the unusual hurricane-related job decline in the low-wage food industry.
Rate moves
Even if wage inflation is weaker than the report suggests, economists said they did not see anything in the September report to dissuade the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates before the end of the year, as expected.
Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics said: ""Unemployment is what matters, and this report therefore makes a December rate hike even more likely.""
Revised jobs estimates for July and August showed US employers added 38,000 fewer jobs than previously reported.
But Mr Shepherson said he expects recovery to begin in October, with a bigger rebound in November.",fake

2771,Wildfires prompt evacuations in California's wine country,"(Reuters) - Wildfires swept through California’s wine country on Monday, forcing thousands of residents in Napa and Sonoma counties to flee and destroying hundreds of homes and businesses, state officials and local media reported.
At least six wildfires, some out of control, engulfed the region in thick, billowing smoke that drifted into San Francisco and Oakland and prompted California Governor Jerry Brown to declare a state of emergency for Napa, Sonoma and Yuba counties.
More than 1,000 residents had been evacuated, CalFire spokesman Will Powers said in a telephone interview. The blazes had damaged critical infrastructure and threatened thousands of homes, the governor’s office said.
The San Francisco Chronicle reported thousands of people had been evacuated and hundreds of buildings and homes were destroyed.
There were no reports of fatalities or serious injuries.
Patients at Kaiser Hospital in Santa Rosa were being removed early Monday morning, according to NBC Bay Area reporter Laura Garcia. “Gurneys being brought out, people in wheelchairs and walkers loaded in cars,” Garcia wrote on Twitter.
Officials said strong, dry winds were fanning the flames and asked residents in mandatory evacuation zones to leave immediately for local shelters, according to reports on a local NBC TV news affiliate.
San Francisco authorities issued an air quality alert due to smoke from the blazes, warning residents to close windows, limit outdoor activities and keep pets inside, according to text messages sent by the city’s emergency notification system.
Since Sunday, firefighters have been battling a 200-acre (81 hectare) wildfire in Napa County, about 70 miles (113 km) north of San Francisco in an area known for its vineyards, according to the state Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.
The “Atlas Fire” was burning in the hills above Napa County and had damaged several buildings. As of Monday morning, firefighters had made no headway containing it.
At least three other fires were burning near Calistoga, a small Napa Valley city known for its wineries, forcing evacuations from homes, shopping centers and hospitals, according to the Napa County Sheriff’s Office.
In Sonoma County, fires also forced all schools in Santa Rosa City to close for the day.

2164,US soldiers killed in ambush in Niger,"Three US soldiers have been killed and two others wounded in an ambush in Niger near the border with Mali, the US Africa Command has said.
Another soldier from a ""partner nation"" had also died in the attack, it said - without specifying their nationality.
The US soldiers had been providing advice and assistance in Niger's counter-terror operations and come under ""hostile fire"", it said.
Islamist militants, including al-Qaeda fighters, operate in the region.
They are most active in neighbouring Mali, where French troops intervened in 2013 to prevent them from advancing on the capital.
The Boko Haram group, based in Nigeria to the south, has also staged several attacks in Niger.
US President Donald Trump has been briefed by his chief-of-staff, John Kelly, about the attack, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said.
Image copyright EPA/US ARMY Image caption These Nigerien soldiers took part in a US training exercise earlier this year
The attack happened 200km (124 miles) north of Niamey, the capital of Niger, the US Africa Command statement said.
The two injured US soldiers had been evacuated to the Landstuhul Regional Medical Centre in Germany and were in a stable condition, it added.
According to the New York Times, those killed were special forces soldiers and were the first Americans to die as a result of hostile fire since the US Africa Command deployed in Niger.
Earlier, an official from Niger's Tillaberi region told Reuters that five Nigerien soldiers were among the dead.
It is not clear who fired on the soldiers.
Militants belonging to al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) - an affiliate of al-Qaeda - are active in the region and are known to have conducted cross-border raids.
Scale of jihadist threat
By Tommy Oladipo, BBC Africa security correspondent
This attack will draw attention to the presence of US troops, not just in Niger but in other countries too. In a letter to Congress in June, President Trump confirmed there were 645 military personnel deployed to Niger to support counterterrorism missions there.
The US has long maintained that its troops play a ""train, advise and assist"" role with its partners, whether in the Sahel or the Horn of Africa. Its acknowledgement that the troops in south-west Niger were carrying out a ""joint patrol"" with local forces is being explained as the US providing ""security assistance"" but it is not clear how broadly this assistance is defined.
The attack also highlights the scale of the jihadist threat in Niger, a vast nation with a varied jihadist presence - Boko Haram in Nigeria, militants linked to both al-Qaeda and so-called Islamic State in Mali, and uncertainty from unstable Libya in the north.
For as long as the regional jihadist threat remains, the US and other Western powers will continue to strengthen their presence on the ground. Their target, the jihadists, will also be motivated to take them on.",fake
2655,Red Sox Rouse Themselves to Beat Astros and Avoid Another Playoff Sweep,"David Ortiz was the one constant for those three teams, and his retirement at the end of last season took away some of the Red Sox’s distinctiveness. They had a successful regular season, winning 93 games and the American League East title, but little stood out about this edition of the squad.
Price, himself, was often more of a distraction in 2017 than anything else, being hampered by elbow problems and creating a disturbing confrontation with the Red Sox announcer Dennis Eckersley over his commentary on the team. The pressures of trying to live up to the seven-year, $217 million contract that Price signed with Boston before last season appeared to be getting to him.
In September, the Red Sox, with Price again available to pitch, decided to use him out of the bullpen rather than as part of the rotation.

He pitched effectively for two and two-thirds innings in Game 2 of this series, although it ended up a blowout loss for Boston, as did Game 1. And Sunday’s Game 3 seemed about to follow the same path. Before the journeyman starter Doug Fister could get a second out for the Red Sox in the top of the first, Houston was already ahead, 3-0, with two of the runs scoring on a homer by Carlos Correa.
But the Red Sox lineup, led by Hanley Ramirez, who vowed to cut off his dreadlocks if Boston rallied to win the series, quickly answered. The rookie third baseman Rafael Devers blasted a long drive over the bullpen in right-center field for a two-run homer in the third inning, putting the Red Sox up by 4-3 — their first postseason lead since Game 1 of last year’s division series.
At that point the Red Sox handed the ball to Price and asked him to keep Houston in check.
He did, hurling four shutout innings and allowing only four hits. He also struck out four Astros, with Red Sox fans reacting each time as if Price were the second coming of Pedro Martinez.
Price did not get the victory, which means his career postseason won-loss record remains an unsightly 2-8, but by the time he was done for the day, Boston had an insurmountable 10-3 lead and a renewed sense of determination.
Price refused to rule out pitching in Game 4 despite his 57 pitches on Sunday. Farrell was clearly hoping that some of Price’s performance might rub off on Rick Porcello, who will be the Game 4 starter for Boston and who followed up his Cy Young season of 2016 with a deflating 11-17 record this year.
“Go out and do his job,” Farrell said of Porcello. “Go out and locate.”
They were feisty words from the manager at the end of an emotional afternoon as the Red Sox, motivated by resentment and pride, were able to make this into a real series after all.",fake

868,Students skate 352 miles during Chinese holiday week,"Image copyright SINA WEIBO Image caption Two students travelled 352 miles (567 kilometres), the same distance from London to Sheffield and back
A couple of Chinese students opted to avoid traffic jams during the Golden Week holiday by travelling 352 miles (567 kilometres) to their destination by roller skate, it's reported.
According to Beijing Youth Daily the two university students set off from Jining College in eastern Shandong province on 1 October and spent five days travelling by roller skate along the motorway to Beijing, where they had plans to spend their autumn break.
The Golden Week holiday sees millions of Chinese travel to their hometowns and villages to spend time with their relatives, but they usually choose conventional road, rail and air journeys.
The pair carried some clothes and basic food and water in backpacks, and chose to eat and sleep at places they came across at the roadside. English language newspaper China Daily says that they collectively wore out 12 bearings on their shoes during their journey, which is the same distance as travelling from central London to Sheffield and back.
Copycats discouraged
""Our families were concerned about our safety,"" one of the students told Beijing Youth Daily. ""But before we set out, we sought the advice of professionals on where not to go, and how to stay safe.""
Jining College confirmed the students' safe arrival by posting pictures of them on their official Sina Weibo microblog.
But state media have discouraged other students from copying their method of travel. Beijing Traffic Police told China Daily that the students violated traffic rules, and that others looking to carry out similar journeys could face fines.
Nevertheless, the students insist that they have no regrets about carrying out this journey. ""This trip was interesting and meaningful. We just took advantage of this holiday and were able to realise a dream.""

453,"Villagers in India's Rajasthan reclaim common land with maps, petitions","Villagers in Barundani look at a map that demarcates their common lands in the western state of Rajasthan, India. Sept. 6, 2017. Thomson Reuters Foundation\\Rina Chandran
HASTINAPUR, India (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - It took residents of Hastinapur village in the Indian state of Rajasthan three years of poring over maps, demarcating boundaries, and numerous petitions and visits to local officials to regain control of their traditional common land.
But the wait - and the effort - were worth it, they say.
The 35 hectares (87 acres) of land now registered to the community have changed the lives of the 50 families because they are now able to safely graze their cattle, meet most of their need of fodder and firewood, and supplement their incomes.
The lush green grounds teeming with native trees and scrub were once arid, encroached by a neighboring village. They are testament to the success the state has had with restoring the commons even as industrial demand for land rises.
“Before we got back the land, the women had to walk some distance to graze the cattle, cut firewood, and we had to buy additional fodder,” Gopal Jat, a village elder, said as he sat in the shade of a leafy jamun tree.
“Now we can graze our cattle without worries, the women and children need not go anywhere else for fodder or firewood, and we earn some money from selling produce. It took time, but this is our land now, no one can take it from us,” he said.
Commons make up more than a third of India’s total land area. They include grazing grounds, some forest land, ponds, rivers and other areas that all members of a rural community can access and use.
They provide food, water, fodder, firewood and livelihoods to rural communities, particularly the poor, while also helping recharge groundwater and maintain the land’s ecological balance.
As the population grew and demand for land rose, commons were taken over for industrial and development projects, including roads, mines, power plants and homes.
“Access to the commons and its resources has long been a customary right of rural communities,” said Shantanu Sinha Roy, a manager at advocacy Foundation for Ecological Security (FES) which helped Hastinapur regain control of its commons.
“But that right has been increasingly denied. When communities regain control, their livelihoods improve, and the land regains its original character, with the soil and water conserved,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
INSECURE RIGHTS
The majority of land conflicts in India are related to common land, according to a study by the Tata Institute of Social Sciences.
Common land in India has deteriorated by about half over the last five decades because of encroachments, insecure tenure rights for local communities and a lack of trust in communities in managing them, according to data from FES.
Many were classified as “wastelands” or government land and diverted for quarrying, biofuel cultivation, mines and other commercial purposes, displacing and depriving local communities.
About half the country’s rural households rely on forests and common land for their livelihood activities, and the loss of commons has hurt farmers, weavers and potters, and triggered migration to the cities for jobs.
The 2006 Forest Rights Act and an older law to protect land of indigenous people recognized their and forest dwellers customary rights to forest land and commons.

Environmentalists - and even musicians - are appealing for the protection of common land to safeguard livelihoods and protect against climate-change impacts.
But states can deny these rights, or change the classification of commons and take them over, particularly in resource-rich areas it deems critical for development.
“States do not distinguish between common land and other lands, and rarely respect customary usage or communities’ claims over common lands,” said Shankar Gopalakrishnan at rights group Campaign for Survival and Dignity.
“When these lands are taken, the effects include pollution, damage to the water table and changes in the ecosystem that result in loss of livelihoods with no compensation,” he said.
“SPECIAL” CONDITIONS
Slideshow (3 Images)
The Supreme Court in 2011 recognized the importance of commons to rural economies, and ordered states to remove encroachments and hand over management to village councils.
Rajasthan, where commons make up 40 percent of total land area, was the first state to draft a policy for commons.
The western Indian state called for the demarcation of commons, management by the community, engaging the help of research firms and non-profits, ensuring sustainability, and ending privatization except in “very special and exceptional” conditions.
As of 2015, about 340,000 acres of commons were managed by 1.5 million people in Rajasthan, according to FES, which is using satellite imagery to map the commons in three states.
In villages that have regained their commons, distress migration has been stemmed, water tables have risen and no new mining projects have been announced, Roy said. .
But progress elsewhere has been limited.
“The Supreme Court judgment didn’t significantly change the situation on the ground, as states shifted the onus for implementation to communities and non profits,” said Kanchi Kohli at thinktank Centre for Policy Research in Delhi.
“Commons are less of a concern for the state than other land-related issues. Within communities too, management can be complicated by caste politics and social hierarchy,” she said.
In Hastinapur and in Barundani, about 35 km (22 miles) away though, the families all come together not just to use the commons, but also to care for them and guard the land from encroachers, said Roy.
The fight for the commons has also empowered women in one of the most traditional parts of the country where women cover their heads, and normally do not speak in front of men.
“When access to water and firewood was limited, women bore the brunt of it. They were also not consulted on matters in the village,” said Roy.
“Now, they sit in on meetings, they are part of the decision making on the commons and other matters. The economic value of the commons is important, but there are also social and ecological aspects that are equally important,” he said.",fake
460,Questions to Ask if You Still Believe the Official Narrative,"By Tony Cartalucci
The attacks of September 11, 2001 (9/11) left nearly 3,000 dead in NYC, Washington D.C. and over Pennsylvania. The attacks transformed America into a deepening police state at home and a nation perpetually at war abroad.
The official narrative claims that 19 hijackers representing Al Qaeda took over 4 commercial aircraft to carry out attacks on New York City’s World Trade Center and the Pentagon in Washington D.C.
The event served as impetus for the invasion and occupation of Afghanistan which continues to present day. It also led directly to the invasion and occupation of Iraq. Attempts to cite the attack to precipitate a war with Iran and other members of the so-called “Axis of Evil” (Libya, Syria, North Korea, and Cuba) have also been made.
And if this is the version of reality one subscribes to, several questions remain worth asking.
1. Can the similarities between 9/11 and plans drawn up by the US Department of Defense (DoD) and Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) in 1962 under the code name “Operation Northwoods” be easily dismissed?
The US DoD and JCS wrote a detailed plan almost identical to the 9/11 attacks as early as 1962 called “Operation Northwoods” where the US proposed hijacking commercial airliners, committing terrorist attacks, and blaming Cuba to justify a US military intervention.
Far from a fringe conspiracy theory, mainstream media outlets including ABC News would cover the document in articles like, “U.S. Military Wanted to Provoke War With Cuba,” which would report:
In the early 1960s, America’s top military leaders reportedly drafted plans to kill innocent people and commit acts of terrorism in U.S. cities to create public support for a war against Cuba. Code named Operation Northwoods, the plans reportedly included the possible assassination of Cuban émigrés, sinking boats of Cuban refugees on the high seas, hijacking planes, blowing up a U.S. ship, and even orchestrating violent terrorism in U.S. cities. The plans were developed as ways to trick the American public and the international community into supporting a war to oust Cuba’s then new leader, communist Fidel Castro.
A full PDF copy of the document is available via George Washington University’s archives and states specifically regarding the hijacking of commercial aircraft:
An aircraft at Eglin AFB would be painted and numbered as an exact duplicate for a civil registered aircraft belonging to a CIA proprietary organization in the Miami area. At a designated time the duplicate would be substituted for the actual civil aircraft and would be loaded with the selected passengers, all boarded under carefully prepared aliases. The actual registered aircraft would be converted to a drone.
The document also cites the USS Maine in describing the sort of event the DoD-JCS sought to stage, a US warship whose destruction was used to maliciously provoke the Spanish-American War. It should be noted, that unlike the DoD-JCS document’s suggestion that airliner-related casualties be staged, the USS Maine explosion killed 260 sailors. It is likely that DoD and JCS would not risk engineering a provocation that leads to major war but allow low-level operators left alive with the knowledge of what they had participated in.
Considering that the US sought to deceive the public in order to provoke an unjustifiable war that would undoubtedly kill thousands or tens of thousands of innocent people, and that other proposals did include killing innocent people, it is worth considering that US policymakers would also be just as willing to extinguish innocent lives when staging the hijacking of aircraft to provoke such a war.
2. Why did US policymakers draw up extensive plans to reassert US global hegemony – including regime change in Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen – without any conceivable pretext until 9/11 conveniently unfolded?
In 2000, US policymakers from the Project for the New American Century (PNAC) sought a sweeping plan to reassert America as a global hegemon. In a 90-page document titled, “Rebuilding America’s Defense: Strategy, Forces and Resources For a New Century” (PDF), a strategy for maintaining what it called “American military preeminence” would be laid out in detail.
It involved global moves the United States – in 2000 – could never justify, including placing US troops in Southeast Asia, building a global missile defense network prohibited by treaties signed during the Cold War, and the containment of developing nations that would eventually end up rolling back US global hegemony in the near future, including Iran, Iraq, China, North Korea, Libya, and Syria.
The report noted the difficulties of proposing and executing the transformations necessary to achieve the objectives laid out in the document. It would be explicitly stated that:
Further, the process of transformation, even if it brings revolutionary change, is likely to be a long one, absent some catastrophic and catalyzing event – like a new Pearl Harbor.
In fact, the entire body of the document is an uncanny description of the post-9/11 “international order,” an order unimaginable had the events of 9/11 not transpired.
It should also be remembered that wars predicated on 9/11 like the invasion and occupation of Afghanistan, were admittedly planned before 9/11 took place.
The Guardian in its 2004 article, “Bush team ‘agreed plan to attack the Taliban the day before September 11’,” would report:
The day before the September 11 attacks, the Bush administration agreed on a plan to oust the Taliban regime in Afghanistan by force if it refused to hand over Osama bin Laden, according to a report by a bipartisan commission of inquiry. The report pointed out that agreement on the plan, which involved a steady escalation of pressure over three years, had been repeatedly put off by the Clinton and Bush administrations, despite the repeated failure of attempts to use diplomatic and economic pressure.
While it seems inconceivable that the American or global public would tolerate the multi-trillion dollar 16 year war that the invasion of Afghanistan has become without the attacks on 9/11, such a war was admittedly in the making – in fact – years before 9/11 unfolded.
Similarly, the invasion of Iraq in 2003 was strongly linked to the aftermath of 9/11, but was likewise decided upon long before 9/11 unfolded.
CNN in its article, “O’Neill: Bush planned Iraq invasion before 9/11,” would report:
The Bush administration began planning to use U.S. troops to invade Iraq within days after the former Texas governor entered the White House three years ago, former Treasury Secretary Paul O’Neill told CBS News’ 60 Minutes.
This echoes similar statements made by US Army General Wesley Clark who repeatedly warned that the US sought globe-spanning war post-Cold War to assert its hegemony over the planet, and fully sought to use 9/11 as a pretext to do it.
General Clark would list seven nations slated for regime change post 9/11, including Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen – all nations now either at war or facing war with the United States and its proxies – or in the case of Libya – entirely divided and destroyed in the wake of US military operations.
3. If primarily Saudi hijackers with Saudi money and Saudi organization perpetrated the attacks of 9/11, why has the United States waged war or threatened war with every nation in the Middle East except Saudi Arabia and its allies?
Not only has the United States made no moves against Saudi Arabia for its apparent role in the 9/11 attacks – spanning the administrations of US President George Bush, Barack Obama, and Donald Trump – the United States has sold Saudi Arabia billions in arms, provided military support and protection to Saudi Arabia’s military and government, partnered with Saudi Arabia in its ongoing conflict with Yemen – all while US government documents and leaked e-mails between US politicians reveal Saudi Arabia is still a state sponsor of Al Qaeda – the organization officially blamed for the 9/11 attacks.
Indeed, a 2012 US Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) report would explicitly admit:
If the situation unravels there is the possibility of establishing a declared or undeclared Salafist principality in eastern Syria (Hasaka and Der Zor), and this is exactly what the supporting powers to the opposition want, in order to isolate the Syrian regime, which is considered the strategic depth of the Shia expansion (Iraq and Iran).
The DIA memo then explains exactly who this “Salafist principality’s” supporters are:
The West, Gulf countries, and Turkey support the opposition; while Russia, China, and Iran support the regime.
This “Salafist principality” is now known as the “Islamic State,” an affiliate of Al Qaeda still operating with significant state sponsorship everywhere from Syria, Iraq, and Libya, to the Philippines and beyond.
Coincidentally, Saudi-armed and -funded terrorists in the Philippines has served as a pretext for US military assets to begin expanding their presence in Southeast Asia, just as the aforementioned 2000 PNAC document had sought.
Additionally, in a 2014 e-mail between US Counselor to the President John Podesta and former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, it would be admitted that two of America’s closest regional allies – Saudi Arabia and Qatar – were providing financial and logistical support to the Islamic State.
…we need to use our diplomatic and more traditional intelligence assets to bring pressure on the governments of Qatar and Saudi Arabia, which are providing clandestine financial and logistic support to [the Islamic State] and other radical Sunni groups in the region.
While the e-mail portrays the US in a fight against the very “Salafist” (Islamic) “principality” (State) it sought to create and use as a strategic asset in 2012, the fact that Saudi Arabia and Qatar are both acknowledged as state sponsors of the terrorist organization – and are both still enjoying immense military, economic, and political support from the United States and its European allies – indicates just how disingenuous America’s “war on terror” really is.
If the US truly believed Al Qaeda carried out the deadly attacks of 9/11, why does it count among its closest allies two of Al Qaeda’s largest and most prolific state sponsors?
Together – by honestly answering these three questions – we are left considering the very real possibility that 9/11 was not a terrorist attack carried out by foreign terrorists, but rather an attack engineered by special interests within the United States itself.
If we reject that conclusion, we must ask ourselves why the US DoD and JCS would take the time to draft plans for false flag attacks if they did not believe they were viable options US policymakers might seriously consider. At the very least we must ask why those at the DoD and JCS could be caught signing and dating a conspiracy to commit unspeakable terrorism to justify an unjust war and not only avoid criminal charges, but remain employed within the US government.
We must also ask ourselves why US policymakers would draft long-term plans for reasserting American global hegemony without any conceivable pretext to justify such plans. Even in the wake of 9/11, the US government found it difficult to sell the invasion of Iraq to the American public and its allies. Without 9/11, such salesmanship would have been impossible. In Syria – with 9/11 disappearing into the distant past – US regime change efforts have all but stalled.
Finally, we must find adequate explanations as to why those sponsoring the supposed perpetrators of 9/11 have remained recipients of unwavering American support, weapon sales, and both political and military protection. We must attempt to answer why militants fighting in Syria under the banner of Al Qaeda have been able to openly operate out of NATO-member Turkey’s territory for the past 6 years, side-by-side US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) personnel who are admittedly fueling the conflict with weapons, money, and training “accidentally” ending up in Al Qaeda’s hands.
It is clear – that at the very least – the official narrative in no shape, form, or way adds up. If the official narrative doesn’t add up, what does?

But could all legends be but an exageration of a simpler story? Something our ancestors wrote down as a twisted interpretation of an average situation?
 
Many paranormal hunters think that these stories have a literal sense to it, and that the world is far bigger and filled with wonders of the unknown.
 
Something intriguing that happened recently was the sighting of a mythical being called the 'Skin Walker'. Many conspiracy theorists claim that this shape shifting witch was really caught on camera and that it's evidence that myth is not an exageration of our known reality, but a forgotten reality.

But just a couple of weeks after his emotional stand against the latest Republican effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act, Kimmel is back stage center, this time in the renewed debate about gun control. Kimmel's impassioned, tearful plea for action on guns after his hometown of Las Vegas was ravaged by a killer wielding an arsenal was the centerpiece of a universal cry of despair that marked the response to the tragedy among late-night television hosts Monday night.
And Kimmel is, indeed, being showered in praise by gun control advocates for taking the outspoken stand he did in his opening monologue.

If they were going to pummel him on social media for taking a stand after nearly losing his newborn son, they surely weren't going to allow him a shred of credit for putting his human face on the gun-control debate.

Welcome to politics in the Trump era, Jimmy.
The truth is, Kimmel has been acutely aware that putting himself out there on both these issues meant sticking his head straight into the political maelstrom that afflicts the nation at this moment in history. He told people, including me, that he expected heavy blowback from conservative and pro-Trump voices.
But he didn't choose either fight as much as they chose him. As a late-night host, Kimmel has never sought the mantle of political activism; events have thrust that upon him.
Before the frightening experience surrounding the birth of his son, Billy, Kimmel did not belong in the company of the most vociferous late-night political satirists, like Stephen Colbert, Seth Meyers, Samantha Bee and John Oliver. He took plenty of shots at the Trump Administration, but less in outrage than stupefaction. He never set out to score political points, only to get laughs.
Kimmel was sucked into the political maelstrom by the commitment that Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican, made: That for him to support it, any new health-care bill would have to pass the ""Jimmy Kimmel test."" When Cassidy's own bill clearly did not do that, in Kimmel's view, Kimmel felt honor-bound to speak out on behalf of families whose lives would be forever altered (and perhaps damaged) by the law.
Then this week's mass murder happened to take place in Kimmel's hometown. Again, an emotional connection became too powerful a force to be ignored. When Kimmel appeared Monday night, choked up by the images of slaughter he had seen, he again conveyed a message in terms most people not stuck in ideological cement shoes could understand.
He was effective for a reason that is completely antithetical to the charges of Hollywood elitism that many on the right have hurled at him. Kimmel simply sounds like a regular guy making reasonable points -- because he is a regular guy. Probably more than any other current late-night host, Kimmel projects solid working-class and family values. He seems to most viewers a guy who could share a beer and slice of pizza with anybody.
So when he is on the edge of emotional breakdown over his fears for his newborn son, or the massacre of innocent people in his hometown, it does not come across to most viewers as Hollywood activism; it comes across as human activism.
It is telling that the blowback fired at Kimmel on social media over his commentary on Las Vegas was an orgy of what-about-ism: How come he didn't take umbrage about so many gun deaths in Chicago? What about all the babies being aborted? Why no tears for Islamic terror attacks? Surely Kimmel was getting more talking points from Chuck Schumer (he acknowledged talking to the Senate Minority leader during the health-care debate). And what about how he has beefed up his own security detail with guys who likely carry guns?
Related: Did Jimmy Kimmel kill the health care bill?
That absolutely none of the attacks addressed the issues Kimmel raised is par for the course in this debate. That some points are absurd -- he needed more security because of threats from people who opposed his views, and when did he say no security professional should be responsibly armed? -- is evidence that coherence has no place in ideological warfare.
His critics also don't acknowledge -- or simply don't care -- that he has had a real personal stake in the positions he has taken; instead they trot out the familiar trope about ""Hollywood elitists"" and how out of touch they are with real people. But Kimmel's public image is antithetical to elitism; he presents as entirely down to earth, even salt of the earth.
Certainly, Kimmel made many tough points in his editorial monologue Monday night. He suggested the politicians who have opposed what he believes is responsible gun regulation and instead constantly resort to offering thoughts and prayers ""should be praying to God to forgive them for letting the gun lobby run this country, because it's so crazy.""
But he also cited his own experience seeing how fires in Las Vegas when he was 13 had led to a terrible death toll -- and then real change that has resulted in laws insisting on increased fire protection. ""Why would we approach this differently?"" Kimmel asked. ""It's a public safety issue.""
None of the tweets and articles in conservative media denouncing him addressed that point.
In the short term, the outspoken stands Kimmel has taken on these hot-button issues have clearly raised his profile, and maybe his ratings. The tearful monologue he delivered Monday soared well past 3 million views on YouTube Tuesday.
But Kimmel surely meant it Monday when he said: ""I want this to be a comedy show. I hate talking about stuff like this. I just want to give you something to laugh about at night.""
Lately, he's been giving a bit more than that.",fake

842,Giant Glowing Spiral Shocks Residents In Russia,"Readers from all over Russia are reporting in that they have seen strange lights and objects in the skies, and many have sent in pictures, and even video, evidence of the event.
 
There are many pictures of this unidentified object - which many described as a bright flash, followed by a trail of smoke and a clear disturbance in the sky. Witnesses say that they saw what appeared to be a small, brightly lit structure, like a small vessel, leading the trail. Almost like a crashing ship that had caught on fire.
 
The pictures come from many different angles and appear to support what those on the ground are describing. The disturbance left in the atmosphere can only be described as eerie and unearthly.
 
Military Says It Was Test Launch

<img src=""http://strangesounds.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/mysterious-glowing-object-explodes-in-Russian-sky-4.jpg"">
 
Unsurprisingly, the Russian government soon put out its official explanation for what had happened and assured those concerned that it was merely a rocket test.
 
This is probably the most overused explanation for UFOs, and many did not believe it. However, even if it was a test, that is still a cause for great concern. Why would the Russians be testing a new ballistic missile? What are they planning on using it for? Do they anticipate a war soon? Given recently intensifying conflicts with The United States and North Korea, any sort of military showmanship or testing should be a concern. If this was a weapon test, then it would seem the Russians have developed some sort of new, presumably very powerful, weapon. Could this be a shot in a new Cold War as relations between Moscow and Washington worsen?
 
Whether the object in these photos and videos was of extraterrestrial origin, or only a disturbing sign of modern world tension, this is cause for grave concern.

3629,Beck: My last album won Kanye over,"Image copyright Eliot Lee Hazel
""Hello, it's Beck..,"" drawls a Southern Californian voice down the phone from a hotel room somewhere in leafy Kent.
Having shaken off the LA jetlag that threatened to ruin a joyous secret gig near London Bridge on Sunday night, the 47-year-old is on fine form ahead of his appearance on Later... with Jools and happy to look back and laugh about Kanye West interrupting his Grammy Award acceptance speech.
The rapper famously stormed the stage in 2015 after Beck's last record, Morning Phase, pipped Beyonce's self-titled one to best album, adding later that ""Beck needs to respect artistry.""
Beck Hansen - to give him his full name - is in an elite club of only two singing stars who have suffered at the hands of a Kanye awards bash tantrum, along with Taylor Swift at the 2009 MTV VMAs. But that's no reason why the three of them can't be friends or even work together in the future, right?
""Yeah, I don't know - maybe!"" he jokes. ""It's the music business. You're walking right into centre of the whole thing - it's a circus.
""We were laughing about it. She'd had dinner with Kanye after the Grammys thing happened and Morning Phase came on in the restaurant they were in and he stopped the conversation and said: 'What is this? This is good.' She was smiling and said: 'This is Morning Phase!'.
""So even when he went on that whole thing I didn't take it personal... Ultimately he had let me know that he liked the record.""

Beck will be seeing a few more ""friends"" at a second surprise London gig in Camden on Thursday ahead of the release of follow-up album Colors on Friday.
But before that he takes time out to talk Kanye/Taylor and how completing his ""painstaking"" new LP was ""like finishing a marathon"", plus why on earth MC Hammer is signing copies for him.
He also reveals what it was like touring with the huge but friendly U2 ""machine"" and what ""a thrill"" it has been to see album co-writer/producer Greg Kurstin (Adele, Foo Fighters, Liam Gallagher) ""gently take over the world!""

That was a great secret show on Sunday, despite you saying the band were all jet-lagged at the start.
Thank you very much, it was a great night. The crowd helped us, we couldn't have had a better crowd.
You've announced another one for Thursday night. Do you like keeping secrets and pulling surprises?
We were originally just coming here to do some TV and radio but I insisted on playing. We haven't played here in over a year and it just doesn't feel like we can come here without playing a gig. It's like visiting your friends.
How was the reaction to new stuff?
I was surprised, it was great. They were singing the backing vocals! One of the songs on the new record, there's a part where there aren't enough of us in the band to sing the backing vocals and the crowd just starting doing it - it was beautiful.
You covered Gary Numan and The Clash at the gig, plus you perform on the same bill as Robert Plant on the Jools Holland show. Do these classic British artists hold a special place in your heart?
Absolutely. They're so formative, for myself, the people in my band, everyone I grew up with. We were completely influenced by the 60s and 80s waves of British (and Irish) musicians. We even just toured with U2 so that influence is still there.
Tell us about touring with Bono and the guys.
It was a great experience, the audiences couldn't be more warm. It was interesting because there was a more elevated feeling of people being passionate about being there and wanting to engage with the music.
The band and their crew are incredibly kind, thoughtful, warm and generous and the doors are open and they want to hang out and engage. Everyone is working hard and there's lots of commotion but it's very calm and very friendly. For such a huge machine it was striking how human and open and relaxed it was.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Beck's ""label mate"" MC Hammer
You've had another musical legend, MC Hammer, signing copies of your new album. He's calling it a 'great party record'.
I think it's great to have him christen the record. We're label mates now. I met him last year at the celebration of the anniversary of Capital Records in Hollywood. It was actually an idea of a friend of mine at the label. There's a scene in Step Brothers where he gets somebody to sign a samurai sword and he's like, 'Why did you get him to sign the samurai sword?' and he says: 'It's the only thing we had!'.
How important is the whole packaging and promotion of the modern album to you?
For better or worse I'm involved in the whole thing. I'd love nothing more than to call someone up and say: 'Hey, can you throw something together and make it great? Or I'll just come by and maybe sing a little something'. I'm more of a hands-on artist in every way.
I have a lot of talented people and musicians I get to work with. Like Greg Kurstin, who wrote and produced the record with me - he's now a storied producer. He was touring with me maybe 15 years ago and we've been in bands together for years.
I wanted to make a record in the spirit of the songwriting team. The more I look back on it, my favourite songs are from bands that had two great songwriters in them. I was trying to create a version of that for myself.
But we're all like family and it's been a thrill for me to watch Greg gently take over the world!
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Adele and Colors co-writer Greg Kurstin, who is ""gently taking over the world""
The last album Morning Phase won the Grammy. How do you top that?
Well, this record started before the last one came out. We wrote the songs in 2013/14, so my idea at the time was to make a record that was very up and had a lot of light in it and positive feeling. I'd been for many years making much more experimental, abstract, darker, moodier music.
I guess a lot has changed during that time, particularly in America. Does this record reflect that?
Not really. These songs were already set in stone, long before the secretion of unfortunate events and tragedies - it's a truly tumultuous time. But I don't think these songs reflect that at all. This is just the record I wanted to make five years ago, it's not really a reaction to anything.
Is it a relief now that it's finally coming out?
More like a collapse! Like the finish line at the marathon. I can't feel my legs! But I've been juggling a lot of things. We've been touring constantly. I've been collaborating with The Chemicals and Flume and helping other people write. I worked on the Pink and Lady Gaga records. All kinds of things. Like I did a charity thing with McCartney. It's been an amazing period of time where these opportunities are coming up - so I've been trying to juggle it but keep my eye on the record.
What are your feelings now looking back on 'that' Grammy Awards night in 2015?
It was such a mixture of shock and amazement. For me the joy was watching all the people that I've worked with for so long all get to share in this victory; the musicians who played with me all these years, the engineers that I've spent 15,000 hours with trying to find this unachievable sound.
Then externally there was this circus of media and the things that Kanye was saying and Beyonce fans who were angry and that's something that you don't ask for. But it's like: 'What did you expect?'. Ha! You know, it's the music business. You're walking right into centre of the whole thing - it's a circus.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Kanye and Taylor Swift: New BFFs
Along with Taylor Swift, you're in an elite club of two people that Kanye has interrupted at big awards nights. Will we ever see the two - or all three of you - working together? Did someone say supergroup?
Yeah, I don't know, maybe! We'll see. I actually performed with her. She invited me out to one of her concerts and we did one of my songs. We were laughing about it. She'd had dinner with Kanye after the Grammys thing happened and Morning Phase came on in the restaurant they were in and he stopped the conversation and said: 'What is this? This is good'. She was smiling and said: 'This is Morning Phase!'. So even when he went on that whole thing I didn't take it personal and he reached out after. Everyone's entitled to their own opinion. Ultimately he had let me know that he liked the record.
Finally, can I ask you about the recent tragic shootings at a music festival in Las Vegas. Are you conscious of this while on stage yourself or do you have to block those things out?
It's the last thing I'm thinking about on stage. But when I hear about it - it's all I'm thinking about. Because that's my work environment, as a musician you can put yourself there and it's horrible. Any of these shootings, whether at a concert or an airport, it's unfortunately the world we live in and you have to keep living and engaging.
Starting with Later with...Jools?
Yeah, we've done it several times and there's nothing like it. The novelty of sharing a stage with all the other musicians. It's funny and also just a humbling appreciation of all the talent there.
Colors is out on Friday and you can watch Beck's appearance on Later... with Jools on BBC Two on Saturday at 22.30 BST.

1758,Digging Up the Dead: Probing the Ruins of Mosul,"Ivor Prickett spent months on assignment for The New York Times in Mosul, Iraq, documenting the battle to recapture the city from Islamic State militants and the aftermath. See more of his reports from a city in ruin here.
— “This is the other arm. Was she wearing a black abaya?” Daoud Salem Mahmoud shouted as he lifted the bone from the rubble and held it out to the small group looking on. A piece of cloth still clung to the sinews. “This one is a black abaya.”
Mr. Mahmoud and a small band of men had picked carefully through the remains of a demolished city street of Mosul, digging through personal belongings and the crumbled walls of family homes.
The work was slow and laborious. They were searching for the dead.
Two months after the ferocious, nine-month battle to liberate Mosul from Islamic State militants, much of the city lay in ruins. Government forces supported by coalition planes had carried out repeated strikes, and the militants had fiercely defended their positions. Thousands may have died in the fighting, many lying uncounted beneath the rubble.
Iraqi Civil Defense workers searching for the bodies of a family killed in airstrikes in June.
Civil Defense workers digging out the bodies of two people killed in their home during an airstrike.
Carrying a body out of a home.
Now that the fight has moved on, the city has turned it attention to recovering those bodies to return them to their families. That task has fallen to the city’s Civil Defense workers, mostly trained as firefighters and rescue workers.
The are focused on the devastated Old City district, where Islamic State fighters made their last stand. The workers move cautiously to avoid leftover bombs and unexploded suicide belts. In August, one of their officers was killed and three crew members were wounded when they disturbed explosives.
It took most of the day for a rotating crew of more than 10 men using an excavator to retrieve just two bodies. The men have months of work ahead of them.
This day, the crew worked slowly and methodically as Sondus Mazaal, her husband and her elderly aunt Nadhira Aziz waited anxiously for any signs of their relatives or their personal belongings.
Mrs. Aziz, the homeowner, sat in a plastic chair 15 feet from the excavator. At times she was engulfed in dust whipped up as the driver dumped mounds of stone and parts of her house beside her, but she refused to move.
She directed the driver and shouted at the men on the ground to retrieve books and bags that she saw poking out of the debris. By the end of the day she was surrounded by a pile of tattered belongings that she wanted to bring with her. When the men said they were unable to bring all of the belongings with them she almost refused to leave.
Nadhira Aziz watched as Iraqi Civil Defense workers dug out the bodies of her sister and niece from her house in the Old City where they were killed by an airstrike in June.
There are still dangers.
A week earlier, the men said, someone shot at them and immediately fled. It was hard to fathom how an ISIS fighter might still be alive months after the battle had ended, and in an area that was largely razed, but the men were on high alert.
The sprawling ancient quarter is now largely sealed off from residents who used to live there, but soon after the crew arrived on this recent morning, some of the group began shouting.
They had come across a young man hiding in a partially collapsed building. He had managed to survive in an area cut off from the rest of the city months after the fight had ended. He denied being an ISIS fighter. But he was found with a mobile phone, some money and four automatic rifle magazines.
A man suspected of being an Islamic State militant was found hiding in the rubble.
Sondus Mazaal directed a recovery crew to the locations of the buried bodies of her mother and sister.
An Iraqi Civil Defense worker who had been digging for the bodies of two civilians throwing an unexploded suicide belt into the Tigris.
The men handed him over to the federal police unit stationed nearby and continued their work.
They haven’t been paid in months, but see this as their duty to the community, said Rabia Ibrahim Hassan, who is leading the recovery efforts. “We will continue until we have finished our work here,” Mr. Hassan said.
Earlier in the day, Mrs. Mazaal had confirmed that the arm bone belonged to her sister. Now, after hours of digging, the crew found her mother in what was once a basement.
Iraqi Civil Defense workers recovered the body of Sondus Mazaal’s mother, who was killed by an airstrike in Mosul’s Old City in June.
Much of the room was still intact, a shelving unit standing along one wall. Her body was almost fully intact, but heavily decomposed after months buried under debris.
Three men worked delicately, digging by hand to remove the mortar and twisted metal around her body. They wanted to remove her body as carefully as possible.
It took most of the day for a rotating crew of more than ten men using an excavator to retrieve just these two bodies. The men have months of work ahead of them.
There was no time to grieve as the men carried the three bodies through the destroyed streets over piles of masonry, past uncleared improvised explosives.
They are also being asked to retrieve those who were hastily buried during the months of fighting before their families fled.
Five members of Fouad Mohammed Sadi’s family died during one week in June. As the push to retake the Old City was in full swing, his wife, his 10-year-old daughter and his brother’s wife were killed when their house was hit by what he believed was a heavy artillery strike aimed at targeting ISIS militants in the area.
“They told us to stay at home and then they bombed us,” Mr. Sadi said.
Mr. Sadi and his brother survived and early the next morning, under continued shelling, buried the bodies before they fled. Mr. Sadi has one remaining daughter and they now live with relatives on the east side of Mosul.
He returned with the Civil Defense to the spot where he had buried his family to exhume their bodies from the shallow grave on the outskirts of the Old City and give them a proper burial.
Leyla Hasan Said sat beside the bodies of five of her relatives and others belonging to another family after workers recovered their remains.
Iraqi Civil Defense workers and Mr. Sadi’s relatives carried the bodies of his wife, daughter and sister-in-law through his heavily destroyed neighborhood in the Old City.
Mr. Sadi wept as helped to lower the bodies of his wife, daughter and two brothers into the ground.
Under Mr. Sadi’s direction, the team of ten men dug into the rocky ground. It didn’t take them long to hit the wooden panels Mr. Sadi had used to crudely cover the bodies. The men removed the remains and placed them in white body bags, as Mr. Sadi leaned in to try and identify his family. There was no time to grieve as the men carried the three bodies through the destroyed streets over piles of masonry, past uncleared improvised explosives.
Mr. Sadi’s two brothers were killed that same week in June, when their home was brought down by an airstrike aimed at targeting ISIS militants in the area. On the same day he dug up the bodies of his wife and daughter, he watched as the Civil Defense workers recovered the remains of his two brothers from what was left of their house.
Before the sunset, Mr. Sadi buried them in four graves, side-by-side in a cemetery in western Mosul.
He never broke down, but he wept quietly throughout the day as he kept himself busy directing the workers.
As he placed the bodies of his wife and daughter into the ground, he dropped his head and stood inside the grave for a moment. It seemed like he might never come out of the hole.
But he still had to bury his brothers.",fake
3663,DOJ grows frustrated with tech firms over encryption,"Story highlights Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said technology companies enable criminals with encryption technology
Negotiations between law enforcement and industry leaders has not been effective, he said
Washington (CNN) A top Justice Department official on Tuesday criticized technology companies that ""enable criminals and terrorists"" with encryption software and foreshadowed a new government approach to the issue that has increasingly frustrated law enforcement.
""When investigations of violent criminal organizations come to a halt because we cannot access a phone, lives may be lost,"" Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said in a speech at the US Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md.
""The approach taken in the recent past -- negotiating with technology companies and hoping that they eventually will assist law enforcement out of a sense of civic duty -- is unlikely to work,"" he said.
Though he did not outline future steps, Rosenstein, seemed to be taking up the mantle of a fight propelled by former FBI Director James Comey in the last administration.

3598,Week 4 Rankings (2017): Top 50 Wide Receivers,"Week 4 Rankings (2017): Top 50 Wide Receivers
(Before It's News)
by Ray Kuhn
When it comes to wide receivers there is a lot to look at. Targets, actual on field production, the skill of the offense around them, game flow, and their defensive match-up are just some of the factors that need to be factored in. There is also a high degree of variability, as one play in either direction could swing the results on any given day. With that in mind let’s take a look at how our options rank for this week:
Antonio Brown – Pittsburgh Steelers – at Baltimore Odell Beckham – New York Giants – at Tampa Bay A.J. Green – Cincinnati Bengals – at Cleveland Jordy Nelson – Green Bay Packers – vs. Chicago Bears Keenan Allen – San Diego Chargers – vs. Philadelphia Michael Thomas – New Orleans Saints – at Miami Mike Evans – Tampa Bay Buccaneers – vs. New York Giants Julio Jones – Atlanta Falcons – vs. Buffalo DeAndre Hopkins – Houston Texans – vs. Tennesee Doug Baldwin – Seattle Seahawks – vs. Indianapolis Larry Fitzgerald – Arizona Cardinals – vs. San Francisco Brandin Cooks – New England Patriots – vs. Carolina Jarvis Landry – Miami Dolphins – vs. New Orleans Tyreek Hill – Kansas City Chiefs – vs. Washington Demaryius Thomas- Denver Broncos – vs. Oakland Dez Bryant – Dallas Cowboys – vs. LA Rams Stefon Diggs – Minnesota Vikings – vs. Detroit Golden Tate – Detroit Lions – at Minnesota Alshon Jeffrey – Philadephia Eagles – at LA Chargers Devante Parker – Miami Dolphins – vs. New Orleans Davante Adams – Green Bay Packers – vs. Chicago Sammy Watkins – Los Angeles Rams – at Dallas Rishard Matthews – Tennessee Titans – at Houston T.Y. Hilton – Indianapolis Colts – at Seattle Kelvin Benjamin – Carolina Panthers – at New England Amari Cooper – Oakland Raiders – at Denver Pierre Garcon – San Francisco 49ers – at Arizona Emmanuel Sanders – Denver Broncos – vs. Oakland Randall Cobb – Green Bay Packers – vs. Chicago Chris Hogan – New England Patriots – vs. Carolina Jamison Crowder – Washington Redskins – at Kansas City Adam Thielen – Minnesota Vikings – vs. Detroit Marquise Lee – Jacksonville Jaguars – at New York Jets Michael Crabtree – Oakland Raiders – at Denver Tyrell Williams – San Diego Chargers – vs. Philadelphia Terrelle Pryor – Washington Redskins – at Kansas City Martavis Bryant – Pittsburgh Steelers – at Baltimore Jeremy Maclin – Baltimore Ravens – vs. Pittsburgh Sterling Shepard – New York Giants – at Tampa Bay DeSean Jackson – Tampa Bay Buccaneers – vs. New York Giants Willie Snead – New Orleans Saints – at Miami Brandon Marshall – New York Giants – at Tampa Bay Jermaine Kearse – New York Jets – vs. Jacksonville Devin Funchess – Carolina Panthers – at New England J.J. Nelson – Arizona Cardinals – vs. San Francisco Allen Hurns – Jacksonville Jaguars – at New York Jets Kenny Golladay – Detroit Lions – at Minnesota Nelson Agholor – Philadelphia Eagles – at LA Chargers Mohamed Sanu – Atlanta Falcons – vs. Buffalo Jordan Matthews – Buffalo Bills – at Atlanta
Notes:
With the acquisition of Jay Cutler a greater emphasis was placed on DeVante Parker due to his big play ability. To start the season Jarvis Landry has been valuable, and I would expect to see that continue this week. Cutler has targeted Landry 26 times over the past two weeks, and the slot receiver has been a PPR machine. After catching 13 passes for 78 yards to begin the season, Landry had a down week against the Jets as he caught just six passes for 48 yards. While that is not going to win your league, it is still a solid floor. In Week 1 the Saints (Landry’s opponent) allowed 157 yards to Adam Thielen. who happens to be Landry’s counterpart. New Orleans also allows the 10th most points to opposing wide receivers, so it should be a good week for Landry owners.
It took three weeks, but Julio Jones is already nursing an injury. Currently it is a lower back injury we have to monitor, and while Atlanta is not concerned I wouldn’t be surprised to see him miss a day of practice this week. Jones had his best week of the season against Detroit with seven receptions, and so far this year he has 265 yards on 16 catches. What is holding Jones’ value back is that he has yet to find the end zone. As we enter Week 4 the problem is that Jones’ opponent (Buffalo) hasn’t allowed a receiving touchdown this year. By no means would I think about benching Jones, or not considering him a WR1, but he wouldn’t be my first choice when filling out my DFS lineup.
Last season DeAndre Hopkins was one of the bigger disappointments of the season, and with a rookie quarterback he wasn’t really on my radar all that much for this season. Houston has not wasted any time in looking Hopkins’ way so far this season, and in three games he has been targeted 37 times which he has turned that into 21 receptions, 204 yards and 1 TD. With DeShaun Watson eclipsing 300 yards passing yards last week, Houston’s offense isn’t a complete liability and that helps Hopkins’ value. This week you also have to like Watson’s match-up as he faces the Titans who have allowed five touchdowns and the fourth most points to opposing receivers so far.
One top receiver who doesn’t have as good of a match-up this week is Mike Evans. Evans has caught seven passes in each of his two games for a combined 160 yards and a touchdown, but this week he has to face a tough Giants’ defense. Last week New York held Philadelphia’s receivers to just 105 yards, and they have the fourth best defense against wide receivers in the league. This isn’t enough to keep me from playing Evans this week in every seasonal format, especially since he did pick up 67 receiving yards on Xavier Rhodes last week, but it is enough to downgrade him.
After missing the first three weeks of the season due to his suspension, Willie Snead returns to action this week. He is joining a New Orleans’ offense that seemed to show some life against Carolina last week, and the Saints get to face Miami and their scuffling defense. The sample size is small, just two weeks, but the Dolphins are in the bottom five of the league in net passing yards allowed. Last season Snead caught 72 passes for 895 yards and 4 TD, and I would expect him to jump right back into New Orleans’ offense, though you might want to exercise a little patience just in case it takes him a week to work off the rust.
One of the bigger disappointments so far this season is Terrelle Pryor. Pryor wasn’t a first or second round pick, but he was taken early enough that he began the season cemented into your starting lineup. Instead it has taken a little longer than expected for Pryor to develop chemistry with Kirk Cousins. After being targeted 11 times in Week 1, Pryor has four targets in each of the next two weeks, and overall he has 10 catches for 116 yards. While I ultimately think Pryor will regain his value, it might be better if he does it this week on the bench instead of in your starting lineup against the Chiefs.

PARIS (Reuters) - Apple (AAPL.O) boss Tim Cook went out of his way on Monday to single out a small French firm involved with innovative features in the latest iPhones ahead of meeting with President Emmanuel Macron, who has called for a tougher line on technology company taxes.
The Apple chief executive paid a surprise visit to Eldim, a Normandy-based firm that has tested optical technology used in the facial recognition system inside new top-of-the-range iPhone X smartphones due out next month. Prices start at $999.
Face ID, as the iPhone X feature is known, will replace the fingerprint sensor for unlocking the phone and features in Apple’s campaign to distinguish the phone from rival devices.
“Bravo for your work!”, Cook said on his official Twitter account in French. A picture of him chatting with Eldim employees was also posted.
Cook later met Macron, who has called for Apple and other tech companies such as Amazon.com to pay more in taxes in Europe.
“Bravo to Europe for acting with determination to get tax rules and justice respected,” Macron said in a tweet last week praising European Union officials for taking member-state Ireland to court to reclaim 13 billion euros ($15.3 billion) in back taxes from Apple.
CONSTRUCTIVE TALKS

A French presidency official said Macron and Cook did not rake over the past and described the talks about regulating digital platforms and tax policy as constructive and forward-looking.
Asked if they had discussed France’s proposal to tax the revenue of big tech companies and not profit, the Macron adviser said: “They didn’t go into specifics.”
“The tone was very open. This wasn’t a posturing competition.” Tech giants were under pressure from shareholders worried about reputational damage over how the companies arrange their taxes, the official added.
Eldim, located outside Caen, near the northern coast of France, had worked with Apple on research projects for nearly a decade before gaining recognition for its optical work on behalf of Apple, the world’s most highly valued company.
“They (Eldim) certainly have a top-notch technology,” said industry analyst Thomas Husson of Forrester Research. “Facial recognition is one of iPhone X’s differentiating features.”
Apple is normally highly secretive about the suppliers it uses to develop new phones, computers and other devices.
A spokeswoman for Apple declined to comment.
Franco-Italian chipmaker STMicroelectronics (STM.PA), one of Europe’s larger technology companies, is widely understood to be a supplier of sensors for the Apple iPhone 7 and forthcoming iPhone devices, but is barred by Apple from saying so.",fake

“has led to an AL East title. If it results in a deeper run through October, the Red Sox can give some credit to the Yankees for giving them the push they might have needed to keep them sharp down the stretch,” reported Fox Sports This “not gunna give up attitude”reported Fox Sports So the unintended consequences of pushing hard but falling short? We made the Red Sox stronger and this idea makes me sick.
“The Yanks pushed the Sox all season long. They won 11 of 19 head-to-head matchups, and since their last meeting, way back on Sept. 3, New York went 17-7, forcing Boston to keep its foot on the gas right up until the final series of the regular season.” According to ESPN
So whatever doesn’t kill us will make “our opponents” stronger is the new axiom for me to contemplate as we head into a Tuesday night one game Wild Card at Yankee Stadium. Let’s win, pick up our pride and move on to play another series. Until we meet again, Red Sox.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India’s prime minister sees scope for further reform of the country’s energy sector and has received “focused suggestions” from some of the world’s leading energy companies, the office of the premier said on Monday.
Under Narendra Modi, the world's third-biggest oil consumer is trying to use its market size to strike better deals with oil exporters and attract investment into India's exploration and refining industries. (reut.rs/2kxQxUi)
Executives from companies including Rosneft, BP, Exxon Mobil, Reliance Industries, Saudi Aramco, Royal Dutch Shell, Vedanta, Schlumberger and Halliburton met Modi as the industry gathered in New Delhi for the three-day India Energy Forum, which finishes on Tuesday.
“Participants appreciated the pace and drive with which Prime Minister Modi has brought about reform in the energy sector,” Modi’s office said in a statement after the meeting.
“Subjects such as the need for a unified energy policy, contract frameworks and arrangements, requirement of seismic data sets, encouragement for biofuels, improving gas supply, setting up of a gas hub and regulatory issues came up for discussion.”
The statement said that many suggestions at the last meeting in 2016 have helped guide Indian policy-making and that Modi said he appreciated the “focused suggestions” made this year and that “scope for reform in many areas still exists”.
Modi was quoted as saying he looked forward to “various opportunities” for cooperation between India and Saudi Arabia, the second biggest oil exporter to the country behind Iraq.
State-run Saudi Aramco, which on Sunday launched a new office near New Delhi, is in talks with several Indian refiners for a possible joint venture by next year.
Its Chief Executive Amin Nasser told the conference after the Modi meeting that India’s oil demand would double by 2040 to about 10 million barrels per day, making it the world’s largest market for the fuel and a priority for the company.
In the meeting, Modi thanked Russian President Vladimir Putin and Rosneft for their support to India’s energy sector. The two leaders were instrumental in helping to seal Rosneft’s $12.9 billion acquisition of India’s debt-laden Essar Oil, strengthening ties between the world’s largest oil producer and the fastest-growing fuel consumer.
In another vote of confidence for India’s energy sector, BP and Reliance have previously said they would jointly invest $6 billion to boost India’s gas output. A BP executive said on Monday that the company was “excited about gas, upstream and digital innovation in India”.
Alay Patel, a senior analyst with consultancy Wood Mackenzie, the global president of which also met Modi, said that India’s domestic energy production outlook was positive thanks to steps such as a simplified licensing regime and clarity on contracts.
“But more is needed,” said Patel. “Allowing marketing and pricing freedom for all gas production, regardless of shore status and contract vintage, would incentivize companies to develop gas in the less explored basins.”",fake

2000,Virtual F1 racers set for their own Abu Dhabi final,"LONDON (Reuters) - Formula One will see at least one world champion crowned in Abu Dhabi next month, even if Lewis Hamilton wraps things up long before on the track, after 20 virtual racers secured their slots for the sport’s inaugural E-sports series final on Tuesday.
The 40 hopefuls on stage at London’s Gfinity Arena had won through from 63,827 entrants worldwide competing on PlayStation4, Xbox One and Windows PC platforms.
The semi-finals, around virtual Silverstone and Interlagos circuits, were live-streamed through social media and f1esports.com.
“A lot of us have come from sitting in our rooms, playing on our consoles and platforms and we’re now in front of everyone here on these stages and performing,” said British qualifier Harrison Jacks.
Abu Dhabi hosts the final round of the real Formula One championship on November 26, but Mercedes’ Hamilton looks likely to clinch his fourth title before then after building up a 59 point lead over Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel with four races remaining.
The first Formula One Esports World Champion will be crowned at Yas Marina on November 24 and 25.
India’s ex-Formula One and Le Mans 24 Hours driver Karun Chandhok said there was plenty of joking about a gamer one day ending up on the real starting grid but there was a serious side to that.
“Today, if you look at it, the cost of going karting is very expensive, sometimes prohibitively,” he told viewers.
”For somebody who is between 12 and 16, the opportunity to hone your craft on games and simulators can be a good step into the world of motor racing.
“We’ve seen people go to Le Mans, we’ve seen people race in GT racing who’ve come from games. I don’t think you can take someone from a gamer straight to being a grand prix driver but they could get a step onto the ladder,” he said.
Formula One’s commercial managing director Sean Bratches said when the Esports series was launched that it represented “an amazing opportunity for our business: strategically and in the way we engage fans.”
U.S.-based Liberty Media, who took over Formula One in January, have targeted gaming as a growth area to drive revenues and connect with younger audiences.
Some of Formula One’s participants are already embracing the world of eSports, with McLaren executive director Zak Brown saying all teams could eventually have their own virtual counterpart.",fake

We live in a time when there are too many things kids can do to entertain themselves while remaining inactive: television and movies, smart phones, video games and social media and of course what my kid loves to do…sleep!
So how can you get your kids to jump off the couch, put down whatever electronic device they’re holding, and join you for a bit of good old fashioned exercise?
The Right Approach
Encourage your kids to exercise! Experience tell us the best way to get your kids to exercise is to set a positive example. So you have to get the party started…grab your FlexFit Mat, lay it out in the living room floor, and invite your kids to join you. Whether or not they do so (they probably won’t at first), make sure you run through some exercises of your own.
Young children love to spend time with their parents, and the more they see you exercising without them, the more they will want to come and join you. For older kids, you might have to work better Jedi mind tricks on them and make it challenging. Competition works great: see who can do the most sit-ups, push-ups, or plank the longest (hint: let them win a few times). Keep a chart in the kitchen with daily results and create an end-of-summer reward.
Make it Fun!
When your kids finally do join you, be sure to make your workout as fun as possible! You could get ambitious like this dad who created a American Ninja Warrior obstacle course for his daughter in the backyard!
For the parents that don’t have the time or resources to make their own mini Mount Midoriyama at home, try setting up a series of exercises that tell a story, or turn on some music and invent a new dance, or create your own iron-kid contest. Use your imagination! After a while, you might be surprised to see how much your kids look forward to working out with you.",credible
2602,The Plan to Beat Pittsburgh,"The Plan to Beat Pittsburgh
(Before It's News)
Offense
Open-Space Tackling Drill
The theme of the Steelers’ clash with Chicago was their shoddy tackling. Time and time again, the Pittsburgh backers and defensive backs struggled to contain what should have been minimal gains in the open field. The Bears didn’t challenge the Steelers downfield because they didn’t have to. Short dump-offs and underneath crossers got the job done.
Now, for a Ravens’ offense that lives off the check down, this seems to be the perfect scenario. However, there are two issues. The backs and receivers simply haven’t been making defenders miss tackles with any level of consistency. And as we saw last week against the Jaguars, opposing linebackers are all over the short underneath passes the Ravens run. The Jacksonville LBs sat on those routes in third-down passing situations.
That’s not to say there isn’t an opportunity to exploit the Steelers’ shaky open-field tackling. But offensive coordinator Mart Mornhinweg has to be better. Like a two-man pick-and-roll basketball scheme, he needs to give his playmakers a chance to work off picks and clear outs to break loose. In particular, he needs to get speed receivers Mike Wallace and Breshad Perriman in the open field, working underneath on slants and crossers that get them matched up with the Pittsburgh defensive backs in trail coverage.
The Steelers were also gashed by tailback Tarik Cohen in space. Naturally, that sets up well for Buck Allen, but Allen really isn’t a shake-and-bake back like Cohen; he’s more of a slasher. Give him the ball in space through coordinated screens and underneath routes that enable him to follow blockers and he’ll have a better chance to gain yards in the open field.
Livin’ on the Edge
The Bears’ ground game against Pittsburgh wasn’t overly sophisticated. They mostly did their damage off cutback runs in which the Steelers front line was washed down chasing the playside, only to lose backside contain. Chicago set up that cutback action by running left and cutting back inside. The left-side perimeter run game was so successful it forced the Steelers to overcommit at times and they couldn’t maintain their gap integrity.
To this point, we’ve seen plenty of the outside zone stretch run (to the weakside) from the Ravens’ run-game arsenal. Baltimore had success creasing the Browns two weeks ago with off-tackle runs. However, the mix of backside cutbacks hasn’t been as prevalent – the backs have mostly stayed frontside to ride out their outside blocks.
Mixing in backside cutback opportunities certainly makes sense in light of the Steelers’ struggles to handle those types of runs. But the counters should be plentiful with the tight ends actively involved on perimeter wham and pull blocks. Overall, run-game coordinator Greg Roman has done a nice job using his tight ends as motion and pull blockers on lead iso runs.
Alex Collins should be the feature guy when the Ravens are in run mode from their base sets. Collins has a lightning burst to the edge. He’s their best bet to stress the Steelers’ perimeter run defense.
Flip the Script
Mornhinweg’s early down play-calling patterns were…curious…to the least. You would think the first-down production would be atrocious given how many three-and-outs the offense had in the early part of the game against Jacksonville. But on three of their first four drives, the offense had gains of four, five, and four yards. That’s optimal for first-down production.
So what happened on second down? The Ravens threw the ball and had incompletions. They went to the gun and tried to spread out the Jaguars and their passing attack sputtered. Even in a key third-and-two conversion opportunity, Mornhinweg opted to throw the ball instead of trying to run it.
Granted, this is a small sample size to harp on. And the defense was buried by scores each time the offense was forced off the field so that didn’t help with the game script. But Mornhinweg needs to reign in the open formations from the gun in those short-yardage conversion situations and give his depleted offensive line a chance to compete. The offense needs to be able to stay on the field to keep the Pittsburgh offense on the sidelines.
Defense
Cloud Coverage Mashups
Last Sunday, the Bears’ defensive focus was to eliminate the big play from the Pittsburgh offense. They deterred Ben Roethlisberger from airing it out deep using a mix of Cover 3 coverages (three deep, four under), with an assortment of “cloud” coverage mixed in.
In the “cloud” setup, the safeties roll to the deepest thirds of the field along with one of the corners (typically the right corner). The left corner will jam and pass off the opposing receiver to the strong safety. This type of “cloud” is geared to take away the 9-route – in Pittsburgh’s offense, that means Martavis Bryant. The Bears stifled Bryant all day, as the dynamic WR finished with just 30 yards receiving.
In the past, Dean Pees has used his own variations of zone coverage to keep Roethlisberger from airing it out deep. If he employs the same “cloud” coverage that the Bears used, the safeties can’t make mistakes in their assignments as they did against Jacksonville. In addition, tackling will need to be at a premium. But if they can maintain their back-end discipline, this is a coverage scheme that can keep Pittsburgh bottled up.
Dime Defense
The toughest part about facing the Steelers is figuring out the right personnel package to line up in from the opening snap. Given that Pittsburgh lines up in so many four-receiver sets, defenses are basically forced to keep a nickel defense on the field at all times, which is tough because the Steelers instantly gain the edge to face a lighter front and run the ball with Le’Veon Bell. However, teams also need to have an answer for Bell’s ability to detach from the formation and line up as a wide receiver. If you play a 4-2 front with two inside linebackers on the field, Bell will have the mismatch in one-on-one situations outside or he’ll eat up soft zone coverage underneath.
That’s why the dime defense (featuring Anthony Levine as an ILB) would be the Ravens’ best personnel bet in this matchup. Yes, the Ravens would sacrifice some of their brute strength against the run. But the reality is Kamalei Correa and Patrick Onwausor haven’t exactly been enforcers, and both players are liabilities in coverage because they’ve dropped too deep and missed tackles.
The Ravens will need Levine’s versatility to match up against Bell and talented rookie slot man JuJu Smith-Schuster. With six DBs on the field, C.J. Mosley would also be freed up to rush and spy Big Ben.
Delayed Blitz Action From Static Looks
There’s always a classic cat-and-mouse game between Pees and Roethlisberger in obvious passing situations. Pees has confused Big Ben at times, using his amoeba looks in which the front defenders are all standing up aside from one down lineman. From this look, defenders will bluff out of the blitz or come, but it’s been tough for the future Hall-of-Famer to discern who’s coming and who’s bluffing.
These defensive fronts have better potential for breaking through against spread looks like the four-wide packages the Steelers run. Overload blitzes are especially effective, and the Bears were able to get home a few times to pressure Big Ben.
However, to this point in the season, Pees hasn’t been showing as many of those exotic standup formations. He flashed some of those looks against the Bengals but has dialed out of it when facing the Browns and Jaguars’ spread looks. The result has been a static defense that doesn’t move around before the snap.
The Bears had success using a static pre-snap approach in which the defenders didn’t move until after the ball was snapped. Once the ball was snapped, defensive coordinator Vic Fangio did a nice job of using delayed blitz action to attack Pittsburgh’s open sets.
Pees can continue to run static looks, but he should incorporate delayed blitz action after the snap. When you consider that Bell is so involved as a receiver out of the backfield, there will be some chances to attack the Pittsburgh front five after they’ve declared their blocking assignments.
One-on-One Matchup to Watch
There are other corners in the NFL who get the notoriety that Smith doesn’t get. But when he’s healthy, he’s a shutdown corner, plain and simple. Against Brown, Smith has had some of his best performances, holding the best receiver in the game to 61 yards and 85 yards in their last two encounters. Brown is used all over the field, so it’ll be tough for Smith to track him on every play. But when they’re matched up outside the numbers, Smith will need to pin Brown to the sideline and use his length to disrupt the wideout’s timing.

1570,Trump suggests challenging TV network licenses over 'fake news',"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump suggested challenging licenses for NBC and other broadcast news networks following reports by NBC News that his secretary of state had called him a “moron” after a discussion of the U.S. nuclear arsenal.
“With all of the Fake News coming out of NBC and the Networks, at what point is it appropriate to challenge their License? Bad for country!” Trump, a Republican, wrote in a post on Twitter on Wednesday.
Trump and his supporters have repeatedly used the term “fake news” to cast doubt on media reports critical of his administration, often without providing any evidence to support their case that the reports were untrue.
Trump kept up his criticism of the media in an appearance with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, saying: “It is frankly disgusting the press is able to write whatever it wants to write.”
In a tweet late on Wednesday, Trump said: “Network news has become so partisan, distorted and fake that licenses must be challenged and, if appropriate, revoked. Not fair to public!”
Any move to challenge media companies’ licenses, however, would likely face significant hurdles.
The Federal Communications Commission, an independent federal agency, does not license broadcast networks, but issues them to individual broadcast stations that are renewed on a staggered basis for eight-year periods.
Comcast Corp, which owns NBC Universal, also owns 11 broadcast stations, including outlets in New York, Washington, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Boston, Dallas and Chicago.
A Comcast spokeswoman referred questions to NBC, which did not immediately respond.
ABC, owned by Walt Disney Co, declined to comment.
Shares in media companies fell, potentially reflecting concerns the war of words could worsen. Comcast was down 0.8 percent, while Disney shed 1.4 percent. CBS Corp fell 1.2 percent and Twenty-First Century Fox slid 2.8 percent.
Recon Analytics analyst Roger Entner called the market response a “short-term irrational knee-jerk reaction” and said Trump faced essentially insurmountable hurdles to getting licenses pulled.
A spokesman for FCC Chairman Ajit Pai did not immediately comment.
Gordon Smith, the chief executive of the National Association of Broadcasters, defended the media’s free speech rights.
“It is contrary to this fundamental right for any government official to threaten the revocation of an FCC license simply because of a disagreement with the reporting of a journalist,” Smith said in a statement.
The NBC logo is picture atop their office building in San Diego, California September 1, 2015. REUTERS/Mike Blake - GF10000189520
ABC, owned by Walt Disney Co, declined to comment.
Numerous Democrats criticized Trump and urged Pai to denounce Trump’s comments.
Senator Ed Markey wrote Pai on Wednesday asking him to “withstand any urges from President Trump to harm the news media and infringe upon the First Amendment,” a reference to the U.S. Constitution’s free speech and press freedom guarantee.
Democratic U.S. Representative Frank Pallone said Trump “seemed to threaten broadcasters’ licenses only because he disagreed with their reporting. This threat alone could intimidate the press and lead to skewed and unfair reporting.”
FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel responded to Trump by tweeting a link to an FCC fact sheet. “Not how it works,” she said on Twitter.
‘FAIRNESS DOCTRINE’
When reviewing licenses the FCC must determine if a renewal is in the public interest, according to an agency fact sheet on its website.
The FCC said in the fact sheet it expects “station licensees to be aware of the important problems and issues facing their local communities and to foster public understanding by presenting programming that relates to those local issues.”
The agency does not issue similar licenses for cable networks such as CNN and MSNBC, or regulate internet news or other websites.
The FCC has said the First Amendment “expressly prohibits the commission from censoring broadcast matter” and that its role “in overseeing program content is very limited.”
In the early 1970s, then-President Richard Nixon and his top aides discussed using the FCC’s license renewal process as a way of punishing the Washington Post for its coverage of the Watergate burglary that ultimately brought down his presidency.
NBC News has reported on tensions between Trump and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, and has said Trump sought a dramatic increase in the U.S. nuclear arsenal during a meeting with national security advisers in July. NBC reported Tillerson made his “moron” comment after that meeting.
Trump on Saturday also suggested he should get “equal time” because of what he described as late-night television hosts’ “anti-Trump” material.
The FCC’s equal time rules apply in limited cases to air time for political candidates and not to criticism of elected leaders.
Trump may have been referring to the “Fairness Doctrine” that was designed to ensure broadcasters present opposing viewpoints about public issues. Republican President Ronald Reagan’s administration eliminated it in 1987.",fake
2522,"As Trump deals with a tragedy, Putin and Kim regroup","Nic Robertson is CNN's international diplomatic editor. The opinions expressed in this article belong to the author.
(CNN) Whatever Stephen Paddock intended when he decided to go on a murderous rampage in Las Vegas on Sunday night , it probably wasn't to stop Donald Trump focusing on North Korea.
In a few brief but deadly minutes, Paddock broke countless hearts. It was the most deadly gun attack in US history, leaving 58 people dead and more than 500 others injured.
But he also unwittingly diverted President Trump's attention from North Korea's Kim, who Trump has taken to calling little ""Rocket Man."" And it created an opening for Russia President Vladimir Putin.
Had Sunday night's appalling events not happened, Trump would have remained mired in self-consuming controversies of his own making.
His divisive statements on the NFL and the National Anthem as well an ugly spat with Puerto Rico's mayor both threatened to spill into the following week. On top of that, he seemed to be spoiling for a showdown with his Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson.
As Paddock was preparing to unleash mayhem, Trump appeared to be preparing for war with North Korea and his top diplomat.
Melania Trump has previously reminded reporters that when cornered, her husband fights. So from where he was standing, we can only guess his world looked full of corners -- and Tillerson was in one of them.
America's top diplomat was on the way back from more North Korean diplomacy in Beijing. He'd flown to the other side of the world for about an hour of face time with Chinese president Xi Jingping. Trump, meanwhile, was pacing the relaxing confines of his Bedminster golf resort, apparently ill at ease with Tillerson's efforts.
JUST WATCHED Kim Jong Un: What we know about him Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Kim Jong Un: What we know about him 01:43
Trump unleashed a furious Twitter fusillade , taking what may have been a private disagreement with Tillerson inescapably public.
""I told Rex Tillerson, our wonderful Secretary of State, that he is wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man...Save your energy Rex, we'll do what has to be done!""
It came on hard on the heels of Tillerson declaring that ""lines of communication"" -- diplomatic channels direct to North Korea -- were active.
State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert tried to cool things off by tweeting that North Korea ""will not obtain a nuclear capability. Whether through diplomacy or force is up to the regime.""
And that's where the spat stood before Sunday night.
In Moscow, though, Putin was moving forward, hosting one of Kim's diplomatic point men.
In a year when Putin has been racking up influence as Trump discards overseas clout in favor of ""America First,"" Paddock's massacre created more opportunity.
With Trump distracted and his North Korea policy public and flailing, Putin saw a unique opportunity to fish for influence in Russia's Far East.
His tiny border with Kim is insignificant when measured against the thousands of miles and myriad nations the Russian Federation abuts. But as a potential chink in the armour of international sanctions for Kim, it opens a door to leverage and influence that Putin might not have seen as so important this time last year.
In his quest for global relevance for Russia, Trump's forced pause on North Korea has let Putin fast forward a little.
For Kim, DC's distractions could have been a chance to mull the Trump/Tillerson rift.
And it seems that he too sees in a distracted Washington fertile ground to exploit. The Pentagon has picked up information suggesting that Kim is readying another missile launch for next week on Columbus Day -- a date no doubt picked to tweak Trump's temper further.
It seems that the attack has served America's enemies well: indeed, it appears to have helped them advance their agendas.
It would be easy to argue they might have done that anyway. But it took until Wednesday for Tillerson to play down speculation of his damaging rift with Trump.
It came after he'd received the explicit public backing of Secretary of Defense, James Mattis, upon whom Trump seems to rely. But not before Tillerson was forced to deny claims that he called Trump a ""moron"" over the summer.
If the White House and State Department are now on the same page -- as they insist and as Tillerson's several pointed references about serving at the President's pleasure seem to suggest -- he is not out of his corner yet: ""I serve at the appointment of the President and I am here for as long as the President feels I can be useful to achieving his objectives.""
Perhaps Trump is sensing his foes circling -- by the end of the week, he put himself back in play by meeting his Generals Warning of a ""storm coming"".
The rhetoric is all well and good, but the fact that the crucial relationship between the President and Secretary of State was up for discussion at all doesn't bode well for the US. And Putin and Kim know it.",fake

by Ray Kuhn
We are now officially in the last week of the season, and at this point, you either want the season to end immediately, or you are hoping it continues just long enough for you to get into first place. Either way, we have you covered here as we take a look at some of the performances that stood out from a busy Monday around the league:
1) Judge Makes History…
Aaron Judge made sure to avoid any drama, as he both tied and broke the rookie record for home runs on Monday. Judge is now at 50 home runs on the season, as he has proved his power is slump proof. Following the All-Star game, Judge weathered quite the dry spell, but his returned in a big way. It’s not like he lost his power, but Judge batted .185 in August with just three home runs. We know that Judge can handle adversity, as he has followed his worst month up with his best. So far this month, Judge is hitting .307 with 13 home runs and 26 RBI. While you are going to have to live with some slumps as the strikeouts will never go away, it was good to see Judge bounce back strong.
2) Sims Picks up the Win…
After previously being a top pitching prospect, Lucas Sims hit some rough patches in the minor leagues, and was then overtaken by some of the Braves’ new acquisitions. The right-hander though, is still just 23 years old, and in 20 games (19 starts) this season at Triple-A, he had a respectable 3.75 ERA and 1.14 WHIP prior to his promotion. On Monday, Sims took advantage of a struggling Mets team as he picked up his third victory of the season. Sims limited New York to two runs on five hits and two walks in 6.2 innings. The start dropped Sims’ ERA to 4.85 as he works to solidify his role for next season. Sims needs to work to keep the ball on the ground, only 37.3% ground ball rate, and he only is striking out 6.95 batters per nine innings. The sample size is small, but the results (4.71 FIP) are still not there. I would keep an eye on Sims, but keep your expectations low.
3) Another Young, Victorious, Pitcher…
Pitching for the Nationals, spots generally don’t open up too frequently in the rotation. That is why it is so important for AJ Cole to take advantage of his opportunity. While Cole is considered a prospect, expectations and excitement aren’t through the roof. In his eighth start of the season, Cole held the Phillies to one run on six hits and two walks to pick up his third victory. This is now the third season Cole has spent time with Washington, making eight starts in each of the last two seasons, and at 25, he seems to be settling into that swing role that doesn’t hold much fantasy value. That is what a 4.10 ERA and 1.57 WHIP will do to you.
4) Donaldson Goes Deep…
Yes, Josh Donaldson did miss a chunk of time due to injury. And the third baseman is batting just .266 this season, even after a three hit effort last night. But no, I’m not sure we get to call the season a disappointment. Donaldson hit his 31st home run of the season on Monday, and he went on to drive in three runs which gave him 75 RBI. I know those aren’t the numbers you had penciled in when you drafted Donaldson, but injuries do happen, and he appears to be perfectly healthy to end the season. Donaldson is one of those players who could give you a little value on draft day, especially the earlier you draft.
5) Gonzalez Drives in Three…
Who really thought that Marwin Gonzalez would lead the Astros in RBI this season? At the beginning of the season, the assumption would be, that a lot of things would have to go wrong for that to happen. Instead, Houston is just two games behind Cleveland for the best record in all of baseball, and Gonzalez has 85 RBI. The super utility man, he played three positions last night, drove in three runs on Monday, with one coming on his 23rd home run of the season. Gonzalez is now at .302 on the season, and the 4.10 pitches per plate appearance he is seeing is a career high (3.69 last season). Who said you need a position to be an effective fantasy baseball contributor? In Gonzalez’s case, just have five positions.
6) Shields Has a Strong Outing…
Yes, I know, it is still James Shields. At one point though, Shields was a sought after pitcher who wasn’t just a punchline. Somewhere in the past few years, Shields lost his way, and his fantasy value evolved into someone to target with your bats. On Monday, the right-hander picked up just his fifth victory of the season with seven innings of two run ball. Shields allowed just four hits and two walks while striking out eight. But if you needed any reminder that this was still the Shields you had become accustomed to, the start lowered his ERA to 5.23. In five starts this month, Shields has a 3.94 ERA, and while I’d consider him at arms length in certain situations, he still has a way to go before I’m counting on him in 2018.
7) Bryant Gets Closer to .300…
With three hits last night, Kris Bryant is now sitting at .297 on the season with just a few games left to play. While the third baseman is having a solid season, it is not a performance worth of your first round pick. Bryant’s solo shot last night was his 29th home run of the season and just his 73rd RBI. Even in a down year, it is nice to see Bryant flirt with .300, and most likely finish with 30 home runs, but we are left wanting more. In fact, this will give Bryant a new career high batting average as he looks to bounce back in the power department next season. While you can likely downgrade him by a few picks in next year’s draft, I wouldn’t make any rash decisions.
8) Hundley Drives in Four…
When it comes to that second catcher spot, there aren’t many places fantasy owners don’t look. Stuck behind Buster Posey this season, Nick Hundley managed to put together some solid production in the 274 at bats he was given. Hundley went deep last night, his ninth home run of the season, and drove in four runs. That gave the catcher a .252 batting average with 34 RBI as he begins to look for a job for next season. When he is in the lineup, Hundley does have some power, and the batting average isn’t a complete liability. Keep an eye on where Hundley ends up for the 2018 season.
9) Haniger Goes Deep, Twice…
With two separate injuries, 2016 could have gone better for Mitch Haniger. But when he has been in the lineup, batting second, the outfielder has lived up to the “sleeper” expectations placed on him at the beginning of the season. Haniger went deep twice last night, a solo shot and a two run homer, to give him 16 home runs on the season in 346 at bats. He is hitting a solid .277 with 46 RBI, and the Mariners have to like what they are seeing out of their right fielder for next season. Don’t let the numbers fool you, as he likely would have come closer to 25 home runs had he played a full season.
10) Forsythe Drives in Four…
The Dodgers can afford to cast a wide net when it comes to veteran additions, and so far, it hasn’t quite worked out with Logan Forsythe. He has struggled in Los Angeles and never really got going. Last night, he filled in at third base, and went three for three with a walk while missing the cycle by a triple. It was just the sixth home run of the season for Forsythe, who despite his four RBI, is at just 36 on the season in 348 at bats. Perhaps he is a veteran bounce back candidate next season if he lands a starting role, but for now, he is more of a utility man.

2009,Brazil studying extradition of Italian ex-leftist guerilla Battisti,"FILE PHOTO: Italian former leftist guerrilla Cesare Battisti leaves the headquarters of the Federal Police in Sao Paulo, Brazil March 13, 2015. REUTERS/Nacho Doce/File Photo
BRASILIA (Reuters) - The Brazilian government is studying whether to extradite Cesare Battisti, an Italian former left-wing guerrilla convicted of murder in his country, Justice Minister Torquato Jardim said on Friday.
Battisti is under arrest in the Brazilian frontier town of Corumbá where he was detained on Wednesday as he tried to cross into Bolivia in a taxi, apparently fearing that Brazil’s government would revoke his asylum status at Italy’s request.
Late on Friday, Battisti’s lawyers said he had been granted habeas corpus, a court injunction ordering his release, and that they were trying to get him freed as soon as possible.
Battisti faces life in prison in Italy, where he was convicted of four murders committed in the 1970s, when he belonged to a guerilla group called Armed Proletarians for Communism. He escaped from prison in 1981 and lived in France before fleeing to Brazil to avoid being extradited to Italy.
Brazil’s Supreme Court authorized Battisti’s extradition in 2009, but he was not sent back to Italy because former leftist President Luis Inacio Lula da Silva granted him refugee status on his last day in office in 2010.
Lula’s refusal to extradite Battisti upset relations between the two countries. But that is likely to change with Michel Temer, the center-right president who took office last year when Lula’s handpicked successor, Dilma Rousseff, was impeached.
“No decision has been taken yet. The matter is being studied because the Italian government has repeatedly asked that he be sent back to Italy,” Justice Minister Jardim told reporters during a conference at the Rio de Janeiro bar association.
Brazilian police said Battisti was being held for breaking currency laws due to the “significant” amount of cash in euros and dollars that he had at the border crossing.
If Brazil decides to send Battisti back to Italy, there is no need for a new extradition request by Rome because the earlier one approved by the Supreme Court is still standing, Brazilian officials said.

By Donn Marten
When the Tampa Bay Buccaneers finally cut ties with Roberto Aguayo, the former FSU Seminole kicker whose mighty mortar kicks didn’t translate to the big league, the team figured that its kicking problems were behind them. Enter Nick Folk. The veteran kicker was to have been the steady foot that the team has lacked since they dumped both Matt Bryant and Connor Barth – both of whom are still kicking in the NFL. The erratic Aguayo was dumped as the organization admitted that it blew up by trading up to draft him in the second round of the 2016 draft. But Folk soon proved that he wasn’t the answer and after a horrific dumpster fire of a game on a nationally televised Thursday night matchup with the struggling New England Patriots, has likely played his last game for the Bucs. It was an ugly game in which even a mediocre performance from the team dressed in red-devil uniforms for the NFL’s Color Burst promotion could have delivered another blow to the reeling Patriots dynasty. But Folk’s three missed field goals and nine points were more than the difference in a 19-14 Patriots win. Not that he was the ONLY problem. …

3157,College Football: Mel Kiper and Todd Mcshay’s List of Most Exciting Players to Watch,"College Football: Mel Kiper and Todd Mcshay’s List of Most Exciting Players to Watch
(Before It's News)
.
It has been argued that scouting takes the joy out of football. Sometimes it is fun to simply watch a game unfold and to enjoy the athleticism of the players without losing oneself in their potential as future NFL stars.
Mel Kiper and Todd McShay spend their days looking at young talent, and they know how to spot a future NFL star. However, the players they have listed below have less to do with how they would have impacted the college football lines for Week 5 games and more to do with the fun they bring to the game.
If you are looking for talented athletes that are merely fun to watch, consider these guys:
+Saquon Barkley
As far as PSU Running Backs are concerned, Saquon is something special, at least on the college level. Forget about Leonard Fournette, this is a 230-pound player that makes lateral cuts he shouldn’t be capable of. With amazing breakaway speed, Saquon makes waves in every game in which he plays.
+Baker Mayfield
This Oklahoma QB’s future in the NFL is a little uncertain. But when you see him run around for fifteen seconds only to throw the ball downfield, you will quickly forget about all the whining surrounding his small size and lacking arm strength. You know he will be in the Heisman conversation this season.
+Sam Darnold
This USC QB is the total package. Not only is he a team player, availing his receivers the opening to make plays but he has a way of using his physical prowess to extend plays, utilizing the entire field and countering any argument being made about his interceptions.
Darnold doesn’t look anything like a sophomore when he’s on the field.
+Damien Harris
Everyone that kept crying about this Alabama RB not being on par with 5-star recruits like Josh Jacobs has been forced to eat their words. Harris doesn’t look like he’s anything special until you see the consistent reliability he brings to the table. Harris always performs at his best regardless of the conditions or the challenger.
+Christian Kirk
It isn’t just his stats (19 catches, 250 yards, 4 touchdowns) that make this Texas A&M WR such a catch. Besides speed and agility, Kirk is always willing to go over the muddle.
+Devin Bush
This Michigan LB is following in the footsteps of his father (who was scouted in 1995) by lining up all over the field, making so many plays and proving to his naysayers why he might be better than Maurice Hurst. You won’t find that many sophomores that hit so hard.
+Roquan Smith
This Georgia ILB has been compared to C.J. Mosley and Coach Kirby Smart agrees. Georgia’s defense is pretty loaded and yet Smith has found a way to stand out.
+Hercules Mata’afa
This Washington State DE is versatile. That is his strength. Comparable to the likes of Deone Bucannon and already boasting 4.5 sacks so far in the new season, the athlete has shown an incredible ability to play on his feet and on the edge.
If you’ve been paying close attention to college football, then you know that there’s a lot of talent to marvel at, from Ben Banogu of TCU to Deatrick Nichols of South Florida and Elijah Marks of Northern Arizona.
But the names above tend to stand out for Kiper and McShay.

3104,The Young White Sox: Looking At Yoan Moncada & Others Getting An Opportunity,"The Young White Sox: Looking At Yoan Moncada & Others Getting An Opportunity
(Before It's News)
by Eric Stashin (aka The Rotoprofessor)
The White Sox are a team playing for the future, and they have been taking these final few weeks to analyze some of the younger players on their roster. Tim Anderson has gotten a lot of the attention, with a red hot September, but he’s not alone. Let’s take a look at a few of the youngsters getting an opportunity and trying to decide if they have any appeal:
Yoan Moncada – Second Baseman
We all know the hype that’s surrounded Yoan Moncada, as well as the disappointment that he’s been. That’s until recently, as he’s hitting .306 with 5 HR, 11 RBI, 16 R and 2 SB over 17 September games. Now the question is if he’s finally figured something out, or if this is nothing more than a flash in the pan.
The big question has always been his ability to make contact, and while he’s “improved” in September it’s not like his 29.1% strikeout rate is going to impress anyone. That said his Whiff% for the month shows a bit of promise:
Hard – 8.82%
Breaking – 12.07%
Offspeed – 30.00%
Obviously there’s still work to be done against offspeed pitches, but his marks against other pitches brings hope that he can continue making contact and further improve his strikeout rate. If that’s the case there’s little question that the power and speed plays, and he should continue to be a productive option moving forward.
It will be interesting to see how he closes out the season, but ride the hot streak for now.
Adam Engel – Outfielder
The youngster is getting regular playing time in the Chicago outfield, though he hasn’t taken advantage hitting .189 with 2 HR and 1 SB over 74 AB in September. For a player expected to provide some speed, he’s struck out a ridiculous 35.5% for the month and that cripples his value. There’s a good chance the White Sox look towards another option over the final week of the season, and Engel is easily ignored.
Yolmer Sanchez – Third Baseman
He’s finishing strong, hitting .275 with 3 HR and 3 SB over 69 AB in September. There’s nothing awful about his strikeout rate (23.4%), though he’s posted a 50.0% fly ball rate for the month. He’s not a tremendous power option, so it’s a bit of a scary number (and makes it unlikely that he can maintain his current .327 BABIP this month). Obviously anything can happen over the course of a week, so if you need to ride him go for it (especially since he sees a lot of time hitting atop the order). However it’s a trend to keep an eye on as we head into ’18.

The episode broadcast on Dec. 15, 2012, which followed the shooting massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut, opened with the New York City Children’s Chorus singing “Silent Night.”
Weekend Update’s Bit of the Week
The co-anchors Colin Jost and Michael Che both delivered pointed comic monologues that advocated for gun control.
Mr. Jost opened the segment by saying, “The investigation into the tragedy in Las Vegas this week has sparked a larger debate in America, between people who want common-sense gun control, and people who are wrong.”
He continued:
This shouldn’t be a partisan issue. The guy had 47 guns. No one should own 47 of anything. If you own 47 cats, you are not a responsible pet owner, you’re a crazy cat lady. And unlike with guns, the government will actually come and take your cats away because everyone agrees that’s insane. Also, this guy bought 33 of his guns in the past year, and that didn’t set off any kind of alert? If I buy $100 worth of Chick-fil-A, I get a text message from my bank that says, ‘Did you just purchase $100 worth of Chick-fil-A? Please, Colin, tell us this is fraud.’ How is no one keeping track of how many guns people own? There is a real law in Texas that says it’s illegal to own more than six dildos. And I get why. No one needs that many. If you have more than six dildos, it’s a clear sign you are training for something awful.
Mr. Che asked, “Why is it so hard to get gun control in this country?” His monologue continued:
“Who are these delicate snowflakes that we can’t just tell: ‘No, you’re not allowed to have 40 guns anymore, Earl. From now on, you can have one gun, max. And six bullets.’ If you can’t hit what you’re shooting with six bullets, then you don’t need to be shooting at it. Learn karate or use your words. I’m sick of this narrative that Americans just love guns so much. It’s not true. Seventy-eight percent of Americans don’t even own a gun. And 3 percent of Americans own 50 percent of all the guns in the country. That’s the problem: that whiny 3 percent that needs to feel secure all the time. That’s why I think we should do a buyback program. For every gun you trade in, we give you one half-inch of penis enlargement. That’s fair. If you trade in 10 guns, you get five more inches. And if women want to trade in their guns, don’t. Keep your guns. You’re probably going to need it to fight off all those men in spandex showing off their brand-new eight-inch penises.”
Mr. Che joked, “Speaker of the House Paul Ryan said that he wants Congress to look into some proposals for gun control. But first he wants to look into this briefcase from the N.R.A.” Here, an onscreen graphic showed a National Rifle Association briefcase full of money.
Missing Subject of the Night
“S.N.L.,” which was hosted by the “Wonder Woman” actress Gal Gadot, conspicuously avoided the subject of Harvey Weinstein, the powerful film producer who is facing decades’ worth of sexual harassment accusations. The apparent reluctance of the late-night shows to address the issue — as of Friday night, only “The Daily Show” had made a single oblique reference to the accusations — has rankled some critics of these programs, who say it is hypocritical of them to have mocked figures like Bill O’Reilly and Roger Ailes of Fox News and even Mr. Trump for sexual harassment accusations while ignoring a prominent, politically liberal transgressor.
Kate McKinnon’s Role of the Week: Doing the ‘Gins-burn’
During “Weekend Update,” Ms. McKinnon reprised her role as Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, whom she plays as a kind of saucy insult comedian. Talking about a gerrymandering case that the United States Supreme Court is considering, Ms. McKinnon said of Republicans, “Hello, we see what you’re doing. It’s like they’re at a cocktail party, they’re taking all the shrimp. And all the Democrats are left with is the sweaty cheddar. By the way, sweaty cheddar is what they called Steve Bannon in college. Ouch! That’s a nasty Gins-burn.”
Addressing Ms. Ginsburg’s own longevity, Ms. McKinnon said: “Joke’s on you. I made a deal with our female God that I would trade height for years. So in 2095 I’m going to be the size of a Playmobil, but I’ll still be kicking ass and taking Boniva.”
Pete Davidson’s Joke of the Night
In a “Weekend Update” routine, Mr. Davidson discussed his recent disclosure that he had been given a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder, which he described as a form of depression. He talked about strategies he could use to keep himself healthy, among them: “If you’re in the cast of a late-night comedy show, it might help if they, you know, do more of your sketches,” he said. “The show is, like, eight hours long and there’s, like, 50 sketches a week. It seems weird you wouldn’t use one of them to fight mental illness, but I guess that’s not your style.”
When Mr. Jost suggested to Mr. Davidson that he should write more sketches, Mr. Davidson answered: “That won’t work. My sketches suck because they’re all written by a depressed person.”",fake
3166,Freedom Exists Under Natural Law,"By Rosanne Lindsay
To know freedom is to know Nature. Living in harmony with Nature leads to peace, prosperity, knowledge, truth, action, and freedom. Nature reflects the order of the universe. Living in opposition to Nature leads to war, control, ignorance, fear, stagnation, and enslavement.
Today, America, The Land of the Free and Home of the Brave, finds herself in shackles and homeless. The foundation of American freedom is cracked. New restrictive mandates form the walls of a prison cell which we have built through our own apathy and ignorance. The original Charters of Freedom: The United States Constitution, The Bill of Rights, and The Declaration of Independence were written to reflect Inherent Rights of the individual. Yet these documents are being ignored by the very government created to uphold them because, by themselves, they are only metaphorical shields.
Why are we losing freedom?
Because we have forgotten where our rights come from. Human rights are natural and inborn, granted by the Creator. They come from our humanity under the Laws of Nature. Natural Law and Justice is, and always has been, the primary fundamental force in the universe. It is a body of Universal Spiritual Laws which governs Consciousness. Consciousness creates through each of us using free will. We are consciousness.
We have stopped taking action to secure freedom. We thought that when we created government in America as a Constitutional Republic, individuals would be recognized to hold certain inalienable rights; rights which are not transferable and which can never be revoked, regardless of what the majority wants, or who holds power. However what we have agreed to is a Democracy.
A Republic is where the people control the government. A Democracy, is where the Government controls the people.
When Rights Are Legalized
Rights granted and legalized by governments are not rights at all. In fact, they are privileges that can be altered restricted, and taken away by legislation or Executive Orders.
These privileges are codified (codes) in legalese. Legalese is the language of statutes, which redefines words as tools to expand the scope and power of the State. Under statutes, a “person” is a legal fiction, not a human being with free will. At the same time, a “corporation” is defined as “a number of persons united in one body, so it can acquire wealth, expand, and enjoy other rights.” Note: a corporation is incapable of loyalty or love. Governments also regulate behavior through licensure. A license is permission to do something otherwise deemed to be illegal.
A government that gives itself power by its own authority is a rogue government and must be restrained, or else the trend is toward a concentration of power where laws are homogenized and standardized to one-opinion rule -a monarchy. Unless we can wake ourselves up, the United Nations (UN) International treaties (UNCRC), intend to “reduce inequality” by implementing new norms of global socialism and corporate fascism as part of their Post-2015 Sustainable Development Goals.
What is Freedom?
To go to the next level in human evolution is to return more deeply into Nature. That is where freedom lives. Freedom is our ability to:
express without limits,
to seek truth and understanding,
to access the foods of our choice,
to choose what we allow into our bodies and our minds,
to grow our own foods and plant medicines,
to speak our truth,
to raise children without government interference,
to choose love instead of fear,
to choose healing over treatment,
to embody and integrate the Charters of Freedom,
to claim responsibility for individual choices, and the consequences of those choices.
How few of us have made our individual declaration of independence, and until we do that, we are not free.– Edwin Manners
The American Declaration of Independence reminds us,
When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature’s God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.
When governments ignore the will of the people and “go rogue” for the benefit of the few at the expense of the many, it is time to remember from where true freedom comes. Our system derives from our free will and consent.
The Polarity Principle
There are two belief systems representing the polarity existing on Planet Earth. Under the Polarity Principle everything has poles or pairs of opposite charge:
One belief system says that a human being is separate from all others, designed to control others when they cannot or do not reason for themselves. This belief derives from man-made written codes that must be learned.
Another belief system says that each human is a cell of the collective web, and that all humans are connected as one entity, one interconnected humanity. This belief derives from Natural Law. Natural Law is not written, but intuitive and knowable by simple observation, reason, common sense, and deduction. ‘By your action, ye shall be known.’
On a free-will planet, everything is presented as an offer to contract and it is always up to each of us to consent or to withdraw consent. Silence is acquiescence. Ignorance of the law is no excuse in the Age of Information.
Legal Vs. Lawful
There is a difference between legal and lawful. Legal pertains to the letter of law, whereas lawful pertains to the spirit of law. Legal matters reflect statutes between government entities and the color of law (i.e., the appearance or semblance, without the substance), whereas lawful matters reflect common law, the law of the land—the law of the people—and are actual in nature, not implied. Going forward, if we are to be free, we must resist playing a game of wits in a corrupt system that seeks to destroy Inherent Rights.
Instead, we must take back the language and determine who we are. Are we a “person-corporation” or a soul embodied? Do we have free-will or do we ask for permission from an outside authority? Do we consent to the dictates of a rogue government or do we withdraw consent? Do we own our bodies or does the State? Do we recognize inalienable rights and act on them? Do we reclaim our sovereignty as free-will beings? It is time to redefine the words we live by to work in our favor.
The Firearms Survival Guide (Ad) True Freedom for all should be seen as the goal of Spiritual development. Such a state can only manifest as a result of human society’s adherence to Natural Law. – Mark Passio, Natural Law, the Real Law of Attraction
Follow Intuition
As part of nature, we must connect to Nature to experience freedom. As Within So Without. When we follow government dictates as truth, we lose touch with our own intuition. We lose connection with our true nature. As long as we remain distracted, debating the details of the system (war, mandates, rigged elections, the NFL, science, abortion, self-identification), we are directionless, lost in a maze of confusion. By consenting to a system of contradictions through our participation and acceptance, the system feeds off our energy.
If America is held up as an example of Freedom to the rest of the world, we must get our act together and identify with Natural Law. Through the power of our vision we become the architect of the life we want to create for ourselves and for our families. We only need to reclaim responsibility and act on it in order to see it emanate out to affect all life. Such is the Law of Nature.
In the American system no government is sovereign. The peoples of the states are the sovereigns. It is they who apportion powers between themselves, their state governments, and the federal government. In doing so they are not impairing their sovereignty in any way. To the contrary, they are exercising it.” – Tom Woods, Tenth Amendment Center

3815,Red Sox Fire Manager John Farrell,"Farrell managed the team to its eighth World Series title in 2013, his first season in charge of the club.
Farrell was 432-378 over five seasons with Boston. He began his coaching career with the Red Sox as a pitching coach from 2007 to 2010. Farrell was also a part of the team’s 2007 World Series title. He began his major league managerial career with Toronto and was 154-170 over two seasons.
“Despite an end to this season that we all wanted to be different, I am proud of this ball club and the resiliency shown,” Farrell said in a statement released by the Red Sox. “I have enjoyed every moment of this job — its peaks and its valleys. There are few, if any, positions in life that create so much passion on a daily basis.”
He also thanked the organization for its support “through a challenging and scary period in my own life,” referring to when his lymphoma was diagnosed in 2015.
“I remain forever indebted,” Farrell said.
Dombrowski wouldn’t go into specifics on his thought process, but said “a lot of different factors” went into the decision to make the move. He said that the team planned to move swiftly on its next hire and that the next manager would “most likely not” be a member of Farrell’s current coaching staff.
Dombrowski said it would be important to be comfortable in front of the news media and relatable to the team’s current young core.

Farrell leaves with a win total that ranks sixth in club history. He is second in postseason appearances (three) behind Terry Francona (five). He is also the only manager in club history to finish in first place in the division three times.
Farrell said after losing to the Astros that the team didn’t meet its goals but had some good young players to develop.

“We had a number of challenges thrown our way from individual injuries to performance,” he said. “But as a team they stuck together.”
The offense slumped after Ortiz retired, even though the team had baseball’s third highest payroll. Several players also had health issues, including second baseman Dustin Pedroia and pitcher Drew Pomeranz.
There also was an off-field incident in June when Price confronted the Hall of Fame pitcher and current television analyst Dennis Eckersley on a team flight.
Price was upset Eckersley didn’t make himself available to the players after what they felt were critical comments about the team. Farrell later said the team had “moved on” from the incident, but the way it lingered raised questions about his control of the clubhouse.
Dombrowski reiterated that the organization was past that incident and said his personal relationship with Price was “fine.”
But Dombrowski conceded that being able to thrive as a manager under Boston’s unrelenting spotlight is a must. He said he had talked to quality managers in the past that he respects that won’t manage in Boston.
It will make his search tougher, but he believes he can find the right person.
“You have to be prepared to take it,” Dombrowski said. “This is a great baseball city. But there’s a lot of scrutiny.”
He added, “I think it’s for some people and it’s not for others.”",fake

The first inning of last night’s eventual Wild Card victory was a disaster. Luis Severino just did not have it and no one expected him to perform the way he did, least of all Joe Girardi. He gave up three runs and Girardi had had enough. What happened next actually ignited a Yankee team that I have not seen since 2009. The Yankees used all of its moving parts to battle back and beat Minnesota in an 8-4 win.

Ceremony to Take Place During Halftime of Legends Homecoming Game with over 75 Jets Legends Expected to Attend
Three Jets to Receive Hall of Fame Ring of Excellence Pregame
September 26, 2017 – The New York Jets will induct former center and perennial Pro Bowler Kevin Mawae into the team’s Ring of Honor during the Legends Homecoming game presented by Toyota against the Jacksonville Jaguars on October 1st at MetLife Stadium. The induction ceremony, scheduled for halftime, is presented by BankUnited.
Mawae spent eight of his 16 NFL seasons with the Jets, starting all 118 regular season games he played with the Green & White. Additionally, Mawae’s seven NFL playoff appearances all occurred with the Jets, as he started two postseason contests in 1998, 2002 and 2004, and one in 2001.
During his career, Mawae was selected to eight Pro Bowls (1999-2004 with the Jets, 2008-09 with the Titans). Mawae also garnered first-team All-Pro recognition seven times (1999-2002 and 2004 with the Jets, 2007-08 with the Titans) and second-team All-Pro once (1998 with the Jets).
As part of Jets Legends Homecoming weekend, more than 75 alumni are expected to be in attendance, including Ring of Honor members Emerson Boozer, Wayne Chrebet, Joe Klecko, Marty Lyons, Curtis Martin, Don Maynard and Joe Namath. All Legends will be introduced on-field 30 minutes before kickoff.
Following introductions, Namath, Maynard and Martin will take part in a special ceremony. Having already received their Gold Jackets and bronze busts upon their enshrinement, they will receive their Ring of Excellence, created by Kay® Jewelers, in front of Jets fans. The Ring of Excellence is the third symbol of recognition by the Pro Football Hall of Fame.
To celebrate Legends Homecoming weekend and the Ring of Honor Ceremony, fans are asked to wear white as part of the Jets Annual Whiteout. The team will take the field in white uniforms and Jets Legends will wear white jerseys. Upon entering MetLife Stadium, all fans will receive a commemorative Mawae white rally towel presented by BankUnited.
In 2010, the team created the Ring of Honor to celebrate Jets greats and commemorate their place in team history. Mawae will become the 18th member of the New York Jets Ring of Honor joining Weeb Ewbank, Winston Hill, Joe Klecko, Curtis Martin, Don Maynard, Joe Namath (2010 Inaugural Class); Larry Grantham, Freeman McNeil, Gerry Philbin, Al Toon (2011); Mark Gastineau, Wesley Walker (2012); Marty Lyons (2013); Wayne Chrebet, Leon Hess (2014); Emerson Boozer, Matt Snell (2015).
BankUnited is a longtime partner of the New York Jets and the “Official Private Banking Sponsor of the New York Jets.”

After a win in week three, the Jets welcomed the Jacksonville Jaguars (2-1) in an attempt to go .500 for the season. RB Bilal Powell started in place of an injured Matt Forte. On a day when Kevin Mawae was inducted into the Ring of Honor, here is the good, the bad and the ugly…
THE GOOD
For the first time this season, the offense got off to a good start. First quarter totals included 4 first downs, 131 total yards and 0 turnovers.
QB Josh McCown was 10/11 for 95 yards in the first half and 22/31 for 224 overall.
Bilal Powell scored on a 75-yard TD run which was the second longest in team history. Powell had 113 yards at the half and a career-high 21 carries for 163 in the game.
RB Elijah McGuire had a 69-yard touchdown run.
WR Robby Anderson led all receivers with 59 yards and a long of 41.
Special teams successfully pulled off a fake punt near the end of the first half.
DE Kony Ealy intercepted a pass from QB Blake Bortles which led to a K Chandler Catanzaro 26-yard field goal.
Catanzaro kicked a game-winning 41-yard field goal.
THE BAD
A costly delay-of-game penalty pushed back a Catanzaro field goal attempt which he missed from 45-yards out.
The defense gave up 145 total yards to RB Leonard Fournette.
THE UGLY
The offensive line gave up costly first-half sacks.
A backwards pass from McCown to Powell was picked up by Jacksonville’s Myles Jack and returned 81-yards for a touchdown.
Jets inactive players included: TE Will Tye, TE Jordan Leggett, OLB Josh Martin, QB Christian Hackenberg, RB Matt Forte, CB Derrick Jones, T Brandon Shell

.
.
The New England Patriots take part in their second Thursday Night Football game on the young season as they travel to face the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The Bucs are 5.5 underdogs. Before you go to casinobet.com to wager on tonight’s game let’s see if there is anything to learn from the previous Thursday Night Football games.
.
Week 1
The New England Patriots came in as 8.5 point favorites playing at home against the Kansas City Chiefs. There was no short week advantage for the Patriots as it was the league opener. Kansas City took full advantage of the Patriots’ struggling defense. Not only did they cover, they won the game outright.
.
Week 2
The Houston Texans went on the road to face the Cincinnati Bengals. They were 6.5 point underdogs. The Bengals were completely inept on offense for the second straight week. Again the road team not only covered, but won the game outright.
.
Week 3
The Los Angeles Rams entered their contest with the home San Francisco 49ers as 2.5 point favorites. This time the underdog did not win the game outright, but they favorite (Rams) once again didn’t cover.
.
Week 4
Finally the home team and the favorite won easily. They Green Bay Packers entered as 7 point favorites against the Chicago Bears. The Pack responded by winning by 21 points. Injuries finally caught up to the Bears and led to beginning of the Mitch Trubisky era.
.
A quick look at the games so far would lead you to believe that road teams have the advantage based on three of the four victories coming from the visitors. A more realistic explanation is the better defense is winning the games. The Chiefs, Texans, Rams and Packers are the better defenses, which would have you 3-1 if you simply selected the team with the better defense.
.
In tonight’s game, the Bucs have the better defense. If that approach remains, you can select Tampa and their 5.5 points tonight.

(Before It's News)
Sending flowers and bouquets to your loved ones as a sign of your love as well as a gift for any special occasion is a gesture many of us do. There are different types of gift options which you have, but a flower bouquet is an endless classic choice which you can give along with another gift too.

Here we are going to provide you with some tips which would help you find the best flower bouquet for your gifting purpose online very quickly.
Always go for an established store
There are many online stores for flowers and bouquets, and you can always get a quality bouquet from the stores which are reputed and established over a period. There are different types of flowers, and if the website is built and have a consistent reputation for their quality maintenance, you can be sure that the flowers would be fresh and superior in quality. Usually, a store is not very reliable in that way would have quality issues and since the flowers would eventually wilt it is imperative that you get a flower bouquet which is made from the freshest flowers that the store can get.
Types of bouquet
There are different types of bouquet which you can find at the stores. Go to an online website with a high-quality image of the bouquets which they have, and you can get a fair idea of the way it would look. Keep in mind that bouquets of different flowers have different longevity and hence you must maintain this factor in mind when you are shopping for a bouquet. Some bouquets contain wild flowers as well which are not always that durable and may wilt by the time it has been delivered to the place where you want to send it. Also, opt for medium sized bouquets rather than something that is extremely significant since the chances of damage during transit is always high with such bouquets.
Budget and shipping
The budget that you have should be taken into consideration while you send flowers. The price of the bouquets would be higher online than a regular retail store, and hence it is important that you make sure that you get the best value for your money. Do check the shipping methods of the website to ensure that they have adequate and quality shipping options which would ensure that the flowers do not get damaged on the",credible

3124,"10 Important Stories From 10/01/17 Box Scores: Snell Dominates, Gonzalez Stumbles & More","10 Important Stories From 10/01/17 Box Scores: Snell Dominates, Gonzalez Stumbles & More
(Before It's News)
by Eric Stashin (aka The Rotoprofessor)
With many teams putting up their B or C lineups, the biggest stories came from the mound yesterday (as we’d expect on the final day of the season). There were a few hitters who had some noteworthy days, but for the most part the spotlight belongs on the Blake Snell’s and James Paxton’s, who stole the show. Let’s take a look at their performances and all the rest from yesterday’s action:
1) A dominant Blake Snell steals the night…
He faced off against a lifeless Orioles team, tossing 7.0 shutout innings allowing 2 H and 0 BB. That wasn’t the most impressive number, though, as he racked up 13 K thanks to 24 swinging strikes. No one has ever questioned his strikeout stuff, the problem has always been his control. Obviously this type of performance has been the exception, not the rule, as he posted a 5.16 BB/9 in 89.0 IP in the Majors last season and a 4.34 BB/9 over 122.1 IP entering the day. The upside is there, and while replicating this performance is going to be nearly impossible it does go to show the type of upside that he has.
2) Jordan Montgomery finishes strong…
Taking on the Blue Jays he allowed 1 ER on 2 H and 1 BB, striking out 3, over 5.1 IP though he ultimately settled for a no decision. You could argue that he deserved a bigger role, as opposed to being bumped from the rotation, but he made his mark and should be locked into the rotation come ’18. He finished with 155.1 IP in the Majors, pitching to a 3.88 ERA and 1.23 WHIP. He entered the day with an 8.46 K/9 (courtesy of a 12.3% SwStr%) and 3.00 BB/9, and he also showed enough groundball potential in the first half (43.1%). While he may never be an ace, pitching in the AL East, he’s going to hold value.
3) Is Daniel Mengden an ace in the making…
He certainly pitched as such in September, and he put a nice cap on it yesterday tossing 7.0 shutout innings allowing 4 H and 1 BB, striking out 8, against the Texas Rangers. Since returning on September 9 he allowed 6 ER on 23 H and 6 BB, striking out 26, over 35.0 IP including three scoreless appearances. While he’s not likely quite that good, he’s shown solid strikeout rates and control (he entered the day with a 7.67 K/9 and 3.42 BB/9 over 109.0 IP in the Majors, with even more upside than that). He also has the potential to generate enough groundballs, especially pitching half his games in Oakland. He may not be an ace, but he should be a solid mid-level option.
4) Gio Gonzalez stumbles to the finish…
At the end of the day no one is going to complain about a 2.96 ERA and 1.18 WHIP, but it was a lackluster finish to the season (though that shouldn’t be a surprise). He allowed 6 ER on 7 H and 3 BB, striking out 2, over 4.1 IP yesterday and finished allowing 5 ER or more in three of his last six starts. He entered the day with an 83.5% strand rate and .252 BABIP, so while it was a solid season overall there’s little chance that he replicates it. We will dig in a lot deeper over the offseason, but don’t make the mistake of paying for this year’s success.
5) Nick Williams finishes with a bang…
Taking on the Mets he went 2-4 with 1 HR, 3 RBI and 2 R, ending his rookie year hitting .288 with 12 HR and 55 RBI over 313 AB. Of course he also entered the day with a 28.4% strikeout rate, courtesy of some awful plate discipline (18.8% SwStr%, 44.5% O-Swing%) and a fly ball rate that may not be able to maintain this type of power (27.2%). There’s clearly a lot of upside, but he also needs to make some adjustments before the league adjusts to him. Time will tell if he’s able to or not, but be cautious before investing too heavily in him for 2018.
6) There’s no questioning James Paxton’s upside…
He simply needs to stay healthy and he could be a Top 10 starting pitcher. He showed off his talent yesterday against the Angels, tossing 6.0 shutout innings allowing 3 H and 0 BB, striking out 9. He was limited to 136.0 innings this season, but racked up 156 K vs. 37 BB while posting a 2.98 ERA and 1.10 WHIP. Throw in a 45.0% groundball rate entering the day, as well as believable metrics (75.0% strand rate, .301 BABIP) and what exactly is there not to like? There’s a good chance that he can be had at a bit of a discount, thanks to the injury history, but the upside remains and he’s a must own heading into next season.
7) Kevin Gausman pitches well in defeat…
He unfortunately squared off with Blake Snell, but that shouldn’t detract from the performance. He went 7.0 innings allowing 1 R on 6 H and 0 BB, striking out 9, giving him a strong finish after struggling in his previous outing (6 ER over 4.0 IP). He certainly turned his season around, after posting a disappointing 5.85 ERA in the first half in part due to a .371 BABIP. He showed better strikeout stuff (9.47 K/9 entering the day) and control (3.05 BB/9) in the second half, and it gives us a reminder of what the upside is. He should remain a solid option moving forward.
8) A lackluster outing for Jack Flaherty…
It was supposed to be Carlos Martinez taking the ball, but St. Louis ultimately scratched him with nothing on the line. Flaherty instead got the ball and struggled, allowing 4 R on 5 H and 2 BB, striking out 5, over 5.0 IP. He never really showed much in the Majors this season, with a 6.33 ERA and 1.55 WHIP, and while there is more upside than that we have to remember that he didn’t show much in the way of groundballs at Double or Triple-A this season (40.0% and 41.0%) and he also benefited from some luck (strand rates of 87.0% and 85.5%). There’s definitely appeal and upside, and he’ll be worth the flier if he’s locked into a rotation spot, but don’t assume that he’ll be an immediate ace.
9) Khris Davis continues to emerge as one of the premier power hitters…
He went 2-4 with 1 HR, 1 RBI and 1 R, giving him 43 HR and 110 RBI on the season. Despite playing in a less than stellar home ballpark, Davis has now hit 85 HR over the past two seasons while driving in 212 runs. Sure the average is never going to be tremendous, but when you are hitting this many home runs that’s something you can overlook a little bit easier. If he could ever cut the strikeout down even into the 25% range (he entered the day at 29.9%) he could be a .265 hitter to go along with his immense power. That would make him one of the elite, but even as is he’ll remain a must own option.
10) Collin McHugh ends the year on a high note…
His numbers weren’t quite as impressive as some others, but taking on Boston he allowed 3 ER on 5 H and 1 BB, striking out 8, over 6.0 IP. He finishes the year with a 3.55 ERA and 1.29 WHIP, with 62 K vs. 20 BB over 63.1 IP. The big question comes from his groundball rate, as he entered the day with a 32.5% groundball rate. He’s shown better than that before (41.7% for his career), and he’s again proven that he can post strong strikeout and walk rates. There’s a lot to like here.

2145,5 Glaring Inconsistencies in the Vegas Shooting that Need to be Addressed,"By Matt Agorist
 
Throughout history, there have been well-documented and factual occurrences of governments carrying staged events to manipulate the public into passing a law, accepting a war, or any other means of implementing control. These acts have been admitted to by the state, are 100 percent real. They happen so often that they have their own term—false flag.
 
There is a fine line to walk, however, between questioning everything and automatically assuming everything is a government conspiracy or false flag. Those who immediately claim every violent tragedy or event is a false flag often do more damage to the fight for truth than those who blindly accept everything their government tells them as the truth.
 
Every time an event happens it is important to keep an open mind, look for inconsistencies, try to find contradictions or impossibilities made to look possible, and always avoid jumping to conclusions.
 
Given the current information that has been released so far in the tragic shooting in Las Vegas, it appears that most everything we’ve been told so far is true and many of the inconsistencies appear to have come up from the mass hysteria and confusion surrounding such a violent and tragic event.
 
However, while most of what we are being told appears to be true, there are still some glaring inconsistencies that need to be addressed. The Free Thought Project has come up with a list of the top five inconsistencies surrounding this tragedy and we feel it is important to point them out to ultimately find the truth. Unlike other irresponsible outlets—rife with falsehoods—we will not attempt to claim we know the truth, nor speculate on a motive.
 
 
 
 
 
1. Stephen Paddock did not fit the bill for a mass murderer.
 
This is perhaps the most glaring of all the inconsistencies as most of the recent psychopath mass murderers in recent history made moves prior to killing that were consistent with being a psychopathic killer. Paddock did not.
 
Most odd was the fact that Paddock was rich. He was an accountant, lived in a half million dollar home in a retirement community and had no criminal record.
 
Paddock’s brother, Eric Paddock was equally stunned to hear about what his brother had done as he had just talked to him. “We’re still just completely befuddled. Dumbstruck,” he said.
 
He described his brother as having “no history of violence. No history of anything couldn’t give a s*** less about politics, religion, pointy hatted people etc, etc. He just wanted to get a freaking royal flush.”
 
Eric said he had last talked to his brother when he called down to Florida to see how his mother was making out after losing power from hurricane Irma. How many mass murderers call to check on their mother before going on to slaughter dozens of innocent people?
 
2. Paddock was still playing with his girlfriend’s casino card trying to rack up points the night of the shooting.
 
 
 
 
Eric Paddock said how his brother “loved to gamble. He loved — when I say loved — it was a job. It was fun because people were nice to him.”
 
Paddock was a regular in Vegas. He’d even been captured on surveillance footage in the Cosmopolitan Casino in 2011 in which he was seen falling. He later tried to sue the hotel for getting hurt and even then everyone remained cordial and nice to him.
 
Prior to the shooting, Paddock had been at the Mandalay Bay casino for four days and had not done anything out of the ordinary to garner the attention of hotel security.
 
He had simply been gambling. While it is possible that he was simply blending in to maintain his cover and wait for the moment to strike, the fact that he used his girlfriend’s slot machine card seems completely out of the ordinary.
 
For those who don’t know, slot cards or gambling cards are ways casinos track loyal customers. When you rack up enough points, they will comp a room or a meal for you. Paddock was playing with this card—essentially planning for future comps—on the very night he opened fire on a crowd of 22,000 people.
 
Blending in is one thing, but racking up points to plan for future benefits on the night you are going to commit mass murder seems glaringly inconsistent.
 
3. Surveillance footage of Paddock inside the hotel has yet to be released.
 
In most mass shootings, within 24 hours we usually see at least a still image of the perpetrator as captured by the building’s surveillance cameras. In Paddock’s case, as of the time this article was published, none of this footage has been released.
 
Why not release at least a single shot of Paddock walking into the hotel lobby?
 
4. Neither room service, house cleaning, surveillance footage, nor security saw him bring hundreds of pounds of guns and ammo into the room.
 
Original reports noted that Paddock had somewhere around ten firearms in his hotel room after it was breached by SWAT. However, reports as of Tuesday morning now say authorities recovered a whopping 23 weapons.
 
Police noted that only one of these weapons was a handgun, meaning that 22 of them were long-form rifles or shotguns.
 
Just to put the sheer logistics of bringing in these guns into perspective, here is an image of 23 rifles.
 
This image shows just the guns, not the hundreds of rounds of ammo to fill them.
 
He had brought “in excess of 10” suitcases to the suite over several days, Sheriff Joe Lombardo said. Yet no one thought this to be suspicious?
 
Housekeepers said they “saw no signs of anything” suspicious, Nevada Rep. Dina Titus told CNN.
 
Paddock had a “pretty well hidden” arsenal, she said.
 
 
American Natural Superfood - Free Sample (Ad)
 
Authorities believe Paddock brought the weapons into the hotel by himself but did not provide specifics.
 
5. If Paddock acted alone, who was this mystery woman who warned everyone they were going to die 45 minutes before the shooting?
 
Caught on video after the shooting was an eyewitness report given to a local NBC affiliate in which a woman was described to have warned of the attack. The eyewitness claims to have seen a woman push her way to the first row of the concert roughly 45 minutes before the shooting began and levy threats indicating that everyone would soon be dead.
 
“So there was a lady who pushed her way forward into the first row and she started messing with another lady. She told us we were all going to die tonight – it was about forty-five minutes before the shots were fired,” the witness states.

The Faroe Islands Translate service has been set up by the Visit Faroes tourism organisation, which - instead of providing instant machine translation - passes your request onto a volunteer, who then provides a live or pre-recorded video translation.
Even Prime Minister and former footballer Aksel Vilhelmsson Johannesen is helping out, offering a welcome to visitors in Faroese.
The language, which derives from Old Norse, is spoken by some 66,000 people, approximately two thirds of whom reside on the Faroe Islands.
Services are available for English speakers and speakers of 13 other languages including Russian, Japanese, Chinese and Portuguese.
Sheep View success
Faroe Islands Translate Project Manager Levi Hanssen says that the service fills a gap left by Google Translate and preserves local language and culture.
""We're taking matters into our own hands and enlisting a whole host of local Faroese people to allow us to help those who want to learn a little Faroese. In doing so, we also build up a video database that visually and audibly logs the Faroese language, something that's never been done before,"" he says.
It's the second time that the Faroes have had a playful dig at Google over a perceived lack of services for its residents.
Frustrated that the archipelago had been overlooked by the US company's Street View mapping service, Visit Faroes set up Sheep View last year to create an ovine tour of the islands. Within weeks, Google sent vehicles to map the island ""officially"", the tourism organisation said.

2416,Student confesses in fatal shooting of police officer at Texas college: warrant,"(Reuters) - A 19-year-old student confessed to fatally shooting a Texas Tech University police officer hours after the suspect’s family warned the school he could be suicidal, according to police and an arrest warrant posted online on Tuesday.
Hollis Daniels was arrested on Monday night following a lockdown at the school and charged with killing officer Floyd East, Texas Tech Police Chief Kyle Bonath told reporters. Texas Tech is in Lubbock, about 300 miles (480 km) west of Dallas.
Daniels’ records posted online by the Lubbock County Jail did not list an attorney. The Lubbock Avalanche-Journal reported that he was a freshman from Seguin, Texas, near San Antonio.
Bonath said that Texas Tech police received a report of a possibly armed student acting erratically, and sent two officers to Daniels’ dorm room.
The officers found drug paraphernalia in the room, and when Daniels arrived, arrested him, and took him to the university police station, Bonath said.
Daniels pulled a gun at the police station, shot East in the head and fled on foot before being caught, officials said.

An arrest warrant filed by Lubbock police said Daniels stated at the beginning of an interview with two detectives that he had shot the officer and done “something illogical,” according to the warrant posted online by local media.
A Texas Tech spokesman told ABC News that a family call had led university police to check on Daniels.
Bonath said that the Texas Tech counseling center got a call earlier on Monday from Daniels’ family saying he may have a weapon and be suicidal.
Bonath was not clear about when the counseling center called police.
East, 48, had worked since May as an officer at the Lubbock campus. He began working for the university’s El Paso campus in 2014. East is survived by a wife and two daughters, Bonath said.
“First and foremost, our hearts go out to the family of the police officer killed at Texas Tech University,” Texas Governor Greg Abbott said in a statement.",fake

""Yes,"" Trump said when asked by a reporter whether he has confidence in the former oil executive.
Trump's relationship with Tillerson has been especially strained since reports that the secretary of state called the President a ""moron"" at a meeting at the Pentagon earlier this year. Trump and Tillerson met in the Oval Office on Friday, sources tell CNN, and are meeting twice Tuesday as their public feud continues.
Trump, clearly scorned by reports of Tillerson's comments, told Forbes in an interview released Tuesday that he has a higher IQ than his secretary of state.
""I think it's fake news, but if he did that, I guess we'll have to compare IQ tests,"" Trump said. ""And I can tell you who is going to win.""

1417,Fundamental And Constitutional Rights Negated In The Realm of Totalitarian Corporatocracy,"By Catherine J. Frompovich
Why are U.S. citizens being subjected to inhuman violations of their fundamental and Constitutional rights by vested corporate interests, and no one in Congress, or in the practice of law or the judicial system, is doing anything to correct and to restore basic unalienable human fundamental rights?
Two specific areas of modern commerce present overwhelming examples of gross human rights violations:
The pharmaceutical industry with its “consensus vaccine science,” which inaccurately promotes and provides neurotoxic vaccines as ‘safe and effective’ that mandatorily must be inoculated into infants within 24 hours of birth and at 2, 4 and 6 months of age when their immune systems and blood brain barriers are not fully developed, thereby predisposing unknown adverse health risks for which numerous innocent children will be ‘sacrificed for the greater good, i.e., ‘community immunity’, with ensuing lifelong harms—or possibly even death—as evidenced by the CDC’s VAERS reporting system and HRSA Vaccine VICP Claims Adjudications [1]; and The microwave industry and its acolyte ‘subsidiary-like industries’, e.g., public utilities, which utilize microwaves to provide electric, natural gas and water utilities metering services despite the plethora of scientific documentation regarding EMF/RF/ELF non-thermal radiation waves impairing and damaging DNA, cellular mitochondria and central nervous systems thereby subjecting customers/consumers to short- and long-term adverse health effects known as electromagnetic hypersensitivity (EHS) or medically as idiopathic environmental intolerance (IEI), including chronic diseases.
As an information researcher and journalist, I’ve thought about how the above problems have been contradictory to the primary law of the land, the U.S. Constitution, especially when, and since, corporations have overtaken Congress and basically write new laws to promote or protect their vested, financial and controlling interests thereby implementing a new form of governance, a “Corporatocracy.”
Corporate lobbyists and the revolving door policy between corporations and government are now the norm. Monsanto’s chief lobbyist, Michael Taylor, as Deputy Commissioner at the FDA and Monsanto’s corporate lawyer, Clarence Thomas, sitting on the U.S. Supreme Court bench since 1991 as an Associate Justice, are perfect examples.
There has to be some way to effectuate enforcing and/or taking back basic human rights in the USA. I did some research online and found a thought-provoking and attention-grabbing write up about a case that just may drive home legal points regarding our being
a. forced to eat genetically modified food without proper identification and labeling; b. forced to drink fluoridated water, a protoplasmic poison which decreases IQ; c. forced to subscribe to allopathic healthcare without standard health insurance coverage to provide for holistic health services and modalities being covered thereby creating a medical monopoly for a failing allopathic health system; d. forced to get vaccines or not be able to go to school, work or partake in other activities; e. forced to be EMF-radiated 24/7/365 with non-thermal RF waves from AMI Smart Meters or have no electric, natural gas or water utilities; and f. forced to breathe weather geoengineering chemtrails chemicals, nanoparticulates and other unknown experimental technologies (Morgellons?) and to live in fear of catastrophic weather patterns being created by the military, who plans on owning the weather by 2025 (“Weather a Force Multiplier: Owning the Weather by 2025” (4)), and other vested interests.
I’m certain there are numerous other grievances readers can remind me about, but I use the above as examples for this article.
After doing online research regarding ownership of one’s “bodily integrity,” I came across a JD candidate’s paper written by Stephanie Weiler in May of 1998 for her law degree from California Western School of Law. The paper is titled “Bodily Integrity: A Substantive Due Process Right to Be Free from Rape by Public Officials” published in the California Western Law Review, Volume 34, 1998, with this notice:
This Comment is brought to you for free and open access by CWSL Scholarly Commons. It has been accepted for inclusion in California Western Law Review by an authorized administrator of CWSL Scholarly Commons. For more information, please contact alm@cwsl.edu. Available at: http://scholarlycommons.law.cwsl.edu/cwlr/vol34/iss2/19
Since the article is “free and open access by CWSL Scholarly Commons,” I will not be violating any of the author’s or copyright regulations in citing what Stephanie Weiler so brilliantly pointed out and argued.
However, I definitely want my readers to substitute all the issues aforementioned above [1, 2, a. thru f.] for “RAPE” in order to understand the position I take and make regarding our basic human rights, which are being violated similarly to being ‘raped’ figuratively, considering various alliterations of that terminology being applied as analogies in this article.
The rape case being discussed in Weiler’s paper was cited as
… depriving a person of constitutional rights in violation of 18 U.S.C.A. §242.1 18 U.S.C. § 242 provides that “[w]hoever, under color of any law …. willfully subjects any person in any State, … to the deprivation of any rights, … secured or protected by the Constitution or laws of the United States, … on account of such person being an alien, or by reason of his color or race …. shall be fined … or imprisoned … or both.
Weiler stated in her paper, “Substantive Due Process is the constitutional guaranty that no person can be arbitrarily deprived of his life, liberty, or property. Specifically, substantive due process provides protection from arbitrary and unreasonable action by government actors.” Babineaux v. Judiciary Commission, 341 So. 2d 396, 400 (La. 1976).
So what is “Substantive Due Process”? According to Wikipedia,
Substantive due process, in United States constitutional law, is a principle allowing courts to protect certain fundamental rights from government interference, even if procedural protections are present or the rights are not specifically mentioned elsewhere in the US Constitution. Courts have identified the basis for such protection from the due process clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution, which prohibit the federal and state governments, respectively, from depriving any person of “life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.” Substantive due process demarcates the line between the acts that courts hold are subject to government regulation or legislation and the acts that courts place beyond the reach of governmental interference. Whether the Fifth and/or Fourteenth Amendments were intended to serve that function continues to be a matter of scholarly as well as judicial discussion and dissent. [….] Much substantive due process litigation involves legal challenges about unenumerated rights that seek particular outcomes instead of merely contesting procedures and their effects. In successful cases, the Supreme Court recognizes a constitutionally based liberty that considers laws that seek to limit that liberty to be unenforceable or limited in scope.[4] Critics of substantive due process decisions usually assert that there is no textual basis in the Constitution for such protection and that such liberties should be left under the purview of the more politically accountable branches of government. Source
Weiler wrote,
The liberty guaranteed by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment “is not a series of points pricked out in terms of the taking of property; the freedom of speech, press and religion; … and so on. It is a rational continuum which, broadly speaking, includes a freedom from all substantial and arbitrary impositions and purposeless restraints .” [CJF emphasis] Poe v. Ullman, 367 U.S. 497, 543 (1961). [….] Over the years, courts have used the liberty guaranteed by the due process clause to protect various invasions on bodily integrity. A brief overview of the cases in which courts have applied the right to bodily integrity to areas of personal autonomy and family decisions… The Supreme Court recognized and protected the substantive due process right to bodily integrity in Rochin v. People of California.52 [Rochin v. California, 342 U.S. 165 (1952).] In Rochin, the Court held that sheriffs violated the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment when they forced defendant to turn over evidence by forcibly inducing him to vomit. 53 Justice Frankfurter explained, forcing defendant to vomit did “more than offend some fastidious squeamishness or private sentimentalism about combating crime too energetically. This is conduct that shocks the conscience.”‘ This action was “bound to offend even hardened sensibilities. [It was] too close to the rack and the screw to permit of [sic] constitutional differentiation. Faced with an even more egregious violation of bodily integrity, the Supreme Court invalidated a Connecticut statute imposing fines or imprisonment for “any person who uses any drug, medicinal article or instrument for the purpose of preventing conception.” Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479,480 (1965)
Question: Wasn’t that very issue, “preventing conception,” in a vaccine’s ingredient given to young child-bearing-age women [2] alleged and pursued by the Catholic bishops in Nairobi, Kenya, Africa?
Furthermore, Weiler went on to say,
… finding that “specific guarantees in the Bill of Rights have penumbras [The rights guaranteed by implication in a constitution or the implied powers of a rule. Free Legal Dictionary] formed by emanations from those guarantees that help give them life and substance. Various guarantees create zones of privacy.” [CJF emphasis] [CJF: In homes, privacy zones are taken away or eliminated by the two-way surveillance-monitoring ZigBee radio transmitters in AMI Smart Meters utilities use to collect and to sell customers’ usage and other data to unknown third parties without customers’ consent and/or knowledge. (3)] In an entirely different context, the Supreme Court upheld a person’s right “generally to enjoy those privileges long recognized at common law as essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men.” Ingraham v. Wright, 430 U.S. 651, 673 (1977) (quoting Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390, 399 (1923)). [CJF: Happiness for free men and women does not mean being subjected to debilitating microwave RF radiation causing EHS/IEI or even long-range diseases, e.g., cancer, as documented by research science (5).]
Weiler, in her paper, points out these important criteria:
In Ingraham, the Court reasoned that “[a]mong the historic liberties so protected was a right to be free from, and to obtain judicial relief, for unjustified intrusions on personal security .” 61. Ingraham v. Wright, 430 U.S. 651, 673 (1977) (quoting Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390, 399 (1923)). [CJF emphasis] [AMI Smart Meters certainly are intrusions on personal security, especially with their vulnerability to being hacked since, basically, they are “computers” that will have to be replaced every 5 or 6 years with customers paying for those new, updated meters.] The Supreme Court has also applied the right to bodily integrity to cases where the patient chooses to forego medical treatment. In Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Department of Health, the Court held that the Constitution does not forbid Missouri from requiring clear and convincing evidence66 of an incompetent person’s wishes to be withdrawn from life sustaining treatment.’ The Court explained that the “notion of bodily integrity has been embodied in the requirement that informed consent is generally required for medical treatment .” 67. [CJF emphasis] Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Dep’t of Health, 497 U.S. 261,282 (1990). [CJF: Informed consent is not requested nor even desired with regard to mandatory vaccinations; vaccinations will be given under great duress as per https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/08/15/2016-18103/control-of-communicable-diseases#h-32 .]
Here’s what I don’t understand with regard to the CDC’s “control of communicable diseases” mandate it assumed as requested (and obtained) in the above document, and U.S. government agencies (CDC/FDA) not abiding by U.S. Supreme Court case law:
In Cruzan, Justice Rehnquist referred to Cardozo’s early definition of bodily integrity, stating that, “[ elvery [sic] human being of adult years and sound mind has a right to determine what shall be done with his own body .” Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Dep’t of Health, 497 U.S. 261,282 (1990). Id. (quoting Schloendorff v. Society of New York Hosp., 105 N.E. 92, 93 (N.Y. 1914)). [CJF emphasis—what don’t they get or want to get? Are we all ‘pawns’ in the push toward transhumanism (6)?]
In my opinion, here’s what all this really boils down to legally about bodily integrity and, as Weiler so eloquently argues in her paper:
As evidenced throughout the common law evolution of bodily integrity, the courts rely on the substantive due process right to privacy or bodily integrity whenever the government impinges upon a person’s autonomy over his or her body. The progression of bodily integrity in the courts confirms that the Supreme Court recognizes and protects people from governmental invasions on personal security. [CJF emphasis] [CJF: Why is THAT legal principal not being factored into corporate memes that want dominant controls over everyone’s life, plus holding corporations accountable legally?] In fact, the Court found that a competent person has the right to refuse life saving nutrition and hydration.94 Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Dep’t of Health, 497 U.S. 261,282 (1990).
In the rape case being discussed in Weiler’s excellently thought out paper, women’s rights were at the forefront. Weiler said,
Forced sex violates a woman’s right to bodily integrity in the same ways restrictive abortion legislation violates bodily integrity. [CJF: Can we substitute the following terms for “forced sex”: Forced vaccinations; forced non-thermal RF microwave radiation waves from AMI Smart Meters, cell phones, cell and mast towers and 5G Wi-Fi in the sky, despite no human safety studies ever performed?] The right to bodily integrity is the essence of the constitutional right to privacy, as the Supreme Court recognized in Griswold, Cruzan, and Casey. [CJF emphasis] [CJF: What has happened that corporations and government agencies aren’t made to abide by and accountable for depriving consumers of one of the ‘gold standards’ of the U.S. legal system: case law enforcement of bodily integrity rights?] The Firearms Survival Guide (Ad) However, both the state and federal rape laws fail to provide victims of rape with an adequate remedy.’ [CJF: The same remedy failures now apply to state and federal laws failing to provide protection at law regarding electromagnetic frequencies, e.g., EMFs/RFs/ELFs, which must be addressed responsibly and ethically (certainly not by vested interest consensus science and their professional associations, i.e., ICNIRP) by the U.S. Federal Communication Commission and the Courts, especially SCOTUS.] Violence Against Women Act of 1994 (“VAWA”).” 8 The VAWA provides the first civil rights remedy to victims of gender motivated violence.”9 The VAWA provides, in pertinent part: [a] person… who commits a crime of violence motivated by gender and thus deprives another of the right declared in subsection (b) of this section shall be liable to the party injured, in an action for the recovery of compensatory and punitive damages, injunctive and declaratory relief, and other such relief as the court may deem appropriate.’ 42 U.S.C. § 13981(c). [CJF: Where’s an act of Congress providing civil rights remedies and protections to victims of EMFs/RFs/ELFs microwave crimes against human health and the environment? What’s the legal difference between a woman being raped and an individual being made sick purposefully by government mandates or illegal laws? Both victims experience physical, mental and emotional damage, especially and ironically, since no human health studies have been performed to prove human safety for EMFs/RFs/ELFs. Microwave ‘safety science’ notoriously comes from World War II ‘vintage’ pontifications regarding only ‘heat safety’. Thirty-two percent of microwave industry-funded studies prove non-thermal radiation wave adverse effects, yet that industry and its professional association ICNIRP adamantly refuse to acknowledge such harms exist from microwave technologies. Shouldn’t that be a prosecutable crime of concealment and collusion under the RICO Act 18 U.S.C. ch. 96 as 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961–1968 (7)?] Equal Rights Amendment of the 1970s. It [will] include the right to freedom of bodily integrity of [one’s] person.”‘ [CJF: Shouldn’t everyone in the USA have the right to freedom of bodily integrity from being forced to eat GMOs without proper identification on food packaging; vaccines should not be forced but voluntary for those who want them, thereby not denying individuals of their right to bodily integrity by being injected by neurotoxins and hazmat materials; not be forced to suffer from EMFs/RFs emitted by AMI Smart Meters, Wi-Fi and various generations of Wi-Fi including the new ‘hot button’ 5G, which have never been tested for human health adverse effects?]
What’s wrong with the U.S. legal system?
My many thanks to Stephanie Weiler for an exceptionally well-written paper regarding bodily integrity.

2397,"Video Of 2,600-Year-Old Alloy From Atlantis Surfaces The Web","During our childhood, we can never deny that the magical story of Atlantis didn't tickle our imagination. The lost empire's story is way too mystical that it fueled a lot of studies to prove that it is more than just fiction. And year after years, we find videos and pictures depicting that the legend of Atlantis is indeed real.
 
There is an alloy, which according to Greek legend was mined on the ancient mythical island of Atlantis, has been discovered on a shipwreck which sank off the coast of Sicily 2,600 years ago.
 
Some 47 ingots of ‘orichalcum’ have so far been recovered from the ancient underwater find. An interesting video of the said discovery was making its rounds over the web.
 
 
It was described as a brass-like illumination and made through the reaction of zinc ore, charcoal and copper, the alloy has never before been discovered in such quantity. Discovered back in 2015, the ingots’ composition was revealed only after analysis using X-ray fluorescence, according to a report from Seeker. Two Corinthian helmets, believed to have been part of the ship’s defense against pirates, were also discovered at the shipwreck. An archaeologist and also the superintendent of the Sea at Palermo named Sebastiano Tusa known to be involved in the discovery said that;
 
Orichalcum or aurichalcum is a metal mentioned in several ancient writings, including the story of Atlantis in the Critias of Plato. Within the dialogue, Critias (460 – 403 BC) claims that orichalcum had been considered second only to gold in value and had been found and mined in many parts of Atlantis in ancient times, but that by Critias' own time orichalcum was known only by name. It became legendary through the writings of Greek philosopher Plato, who wrote that the material was mined in Atlantis, where it covered Poseidon’s temple. Along with the ingots 39, lumps of orichalcum were also recovered from the shipwreck, believed to have sunk en route from Greece to Gela in Sicily, a wealthy city, rich in artisan workshops. The seas around Sicily contain at least two other ancient shipwrecks, making it a priceless mine of archaeological finds.

An elementary school librarian in Massachusetts refused an offer of free books from First Lady Melania Trump after her school was selected as the state’s National Read-a-Book Day winner by the White House.
The White House chose one school in every state to receive a collection of ten Dr. Seuss books.
“As I was thinking about your return to school, I wanted to send you a special gift. Dr. Seuss’s Oh the Places You’ll Go! is a book my son and I have read over and over again, and one that we want to share with all of you,” Mrs. Trump wrote to the school.
Cambridgeport Elementary’s librarian, Liz Phipps Soeiro, found the gift ill-thought and according to a letter she sent back to the first lady, she seemed to be offended by the award.
You may not be aware of this, but Dr. Seuss is a bit of a cliché, a tired and worn ambassador for children’s literature. As First Lady of the United States, you have an incredible platform with world-class resources at your fingertips. Just down the street you have access to a phenomenal children’s librarian: Dr. Carla Hayden, the current Librarian of Congress. I have no doubt Dr. Hayden would have given you some stellar recommendations.
Because five, six and seven-year-old kids hate rhyming books with colorful images that draw them into reading them over-and-over. According to Ms. Soerio, Melania should have gone to the Library of Congress and selected a headier set of titles. Seriously?
She then went on a politically-motivated social justice rant:
Why not go out of your way to gift books to underfunded and underprivileged communities that continue to be marginalized and maligned by policies put in place by Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos? Why not reflect on those “high standards of excellence” beyond only what the numbers suggest? .. Another fact that many people are unaware of is that Dr. Seuss’s illustrations are steeped in racist propaganda, caricatures, and harmful stereotypes.
This is who is educating America’s children and we wonder why we are the 24th in the world in reading despite all this diversity, money, social justice and such.
If the librarian was so worried that her school was over-privileged, she should have accepted the award and asked permission from the administrators to gift the collection to a school of her choice. But, she instead to use it as

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian federal Judge Sérgio Moro on Monday said the Car Wash probe, Brazil’s largest ever corruption investigation, is nearing completion in the southern city of Curitiba, where it started in 2014.
“There are still investigations under way, but a large part of the work has been done,” Moro told reporters in Sao Paulo after a ceremony where he received a distinction from U.S.-based Notre Dame University for his work leading the probe.
Brazil’s largest corruption probe started almost by accident in Curitiba, when investigators went to a local Car Wash to ask owners why the small company had done several international money transfers. From there it spread to several state-controlled companies, politicians, parties and private engineering groups.
But Curitiba remained the host city for almost the whole investigation.

Moro said he is a bit tired due to the workload resulting from the spreading probe, but he ruled out leaving the operation until it is concluded.
He also dismissed suggestions that he could run in next year’s election, despite the huge popularity he gained among Brazilians.

Some pollsters such as Datafolha have included Moro’s name in some early surveys.
“They are losing their time, because this is not going to happen. Simple as that”, he said, adding that he is a professional federal judge and will remain so.
Despite the prospect of work related to the Car Wash investigation to end in Curitiba, Moro said they it will go on in other cities who host higher court instances and also in Brasilia, where several parts of the probe are being conducted by the Supreme Court.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - People living on the Solomon Islands in the Pacific Ocean long had spoken of a big, tree-dwelling rat called vika that inhabited the rainforest, but the remarkable rodent managed to elude scientists -- until now.
After searching for it for years with cameras mounted in trees and traps, scientists said they finally caught up with the rat on Vangunu Island, part of the Solomon Islands, spotting one as it emerged from a tree felled by loggers.
It instantly joined the list of the biggest rats in the world, weighing about four times more than an ordinary rat and measuring about 1-1/2 feet (about half a meter) long.
“Vika lives in a very thick, complex forest, and it is up in the canopy so it is difficult to find. It is also a rare species. It is likely there are not many of these rats left,” mammalogist Tyrone Lavery of the Field Museum in Chicago, who led the research, said on Thursday.
The orange-brown rat dines on nuts and fruit, has short ears, a smooth tail with very fine scales and wide feet that allow it to move through the forest canopy.
The rat is reputed to chew holes in coconuts to eat the inside. “I haven’t found proof of this yet, but I have found that they can eat a very thick-shelled nut called a ngali nut,” Lavery said.
A small number of rat species around the world rival vika’s size. Lavery said a vika relative also inhabiting the Solomon Islands, called Poncelet’s giant rat, is twice the size.
The world’s largest rodent is not a rat, but rather South America’s barrel-shaped capybara.
A phenomenon called the “island effect” may help account for the size of Vika and other big rat species in the Solomon Islands.
“The island effect, or island syndrome, relates to the effects living on an island has on the evolution of body size. On islands, small species such as rats, evolve to have larger body size, they attain higher population densities and they produce fewer offspring,” Lavery said.
“Vika also probably arrived on an island where there were no other large mammals living in the canopy eating fruits and nuts so the species evolved to fill this niche,” Lavery said.
Lavery said vika should be considered critically endangered, with logging threatening its habitat.
The research was published this week in the Journal of Mammalogy.

2615,US Missile Machinations Undoes Non-Proliferation Efforts,"By Ulson Gunnar
When it comes to nuclear weapons upon the international stage, the general consensus is certainly not “the more the merrier.” Attempts to limit the number and variety of nuclear weapons and to take measures to avoid the use of those that do exist have been ongoing since the first nuclear weapons were developed at the end of World War 2.
Today, however, one of the several nuclear-armed nations of the world and its behavior has jeopardized the hard-fought progress made toward this goal.
America Reneged After the Cold War
One of several treaties singed during the later stages of the Cold War included the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (ABMT). It limited anti-ballistic missile systems to two per country. The reasoning was to hinder anti-missile technology development and leave nuclear-armed nations open to retaliatory attacks should they initiate a nuclear first strike.
The treaty helped further enhance the concept of “mutually assured destruction” (MAD). After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, member states upheld the treaty with the United States until 2001 when the United States unilaterally withdrew from it.
The White House in an official statement regarding America’s withdrawal from the treaty, would state:
…the United States and Russia face new threats to their security. Principal among these threats are weapons of mass destruction and their delivery means wielded by terrorists and rogue states. A number of such states are acquiring increasingly longer-range ballistic missiles as instruments of blackmail and coercion against the United States and its friends and allies. The United States must defend its homeland, its forces and its friends and allies against these threats. We must develop and deploy the means to deter and protect against them, including through limited missile defense of our territory.
However, the United States would spend the next decade and a half, not developing anti-missile systems aimed at stopping non-existent weapons of mass destruction launched from “rogue states,” it instead spent that time encircling Russia with anti-missile systems, including those placed in Eastern Europe.
In essence, the United States has begun to fulfill the sum of all fears during the Cold War, that a nuclear armed nation would attempt to monopolize missile defense technology and use it as a means to develop a nuclear first strike capability without fear of retaliation.
Opponents of America’s decision to withdraw from the ABMT noted that the move also undermined Washington’s own alleged nuclear non-proliferation efforts.
Russia Reacts
Articles like February 2017 New York Times piece titled, “Russia Deploys Missile, Violating Treaty and Challenging Trump,” attempt to portray Russia as menacing the US and its Western European allies with new and potentially “illegal” nuclear weapons.
The New York Times reports:
The ground-launched cruise missile at the center of American concerns is one that the Obama administration said in 2014 had been tested in violation of a 1987 treaty that bans American and Russian intermediate-range missiles based on land. The Obama administration had sought to persuade the Russians to correct the violation while the missile was still in the test phase. Instead, the Russians have moved ahead with the system, deploying a fully operational unit.
The article refers to another landmark effort made during the Cold War to reduce the likelihood of nuclear war, the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, signed in 1987 by the United States and the Soviet Union.
Yet despite this narrative, the New York Times itself gives away what provoked Russia’s recent deployment of the missile system in the first place, stating (emphasis added):
The missile program has been a major concern for the Pentagon, which has developed options for how to respond, including deploying additional missile defenses in Europe or developing air-based or sea-based cruise missiles.
Clearly, Russia is responding to existing missile defenses the US has placed across Europe, or plans on placing across Europe in the near future.
As predicted by opponents of America’s 2001 decision to withdraw from the Cold War ABMT, America has undermined non-proliferation efforts, not only inviting other nations to discard efforts to rein in nuclear proliferation and the number and variety of nuclear weapons deployed by a nation, but in fact leaving nations with no other choice in the face of America’s own attempts to obtain a nuclear first strike capability.
NATO’s Expansion is a Lit Fuse
As NATO expands and as the United States digs in along Russia’s borders, a proverbial fuse lit by America’s withdrawal from the ABMT and its belligerence toward Russia ever since becomes shorter and shorter.
By provoking Russia into developing and deploying nuclear-capable intermediate-range missiles able to negate the possibility of a US nuclear first strike, the amount of time between launch and all out nuclear war has been significantly shortened.
Despite the US provoking this chain of events, instead of taking stock and retreating to a more sensible position, it is using Russia’s predictable reaction to rush even further forward. By posing a greater nuclear threat to Russia, the United States through its own irresponsible behavior upon the world stage encourages many other nations to pursue, develop and deploy nuclear armaments as a means of defense and deterrence.
While the United States poses as international arbiter of nuclear non-proliferation, it appears instead to serve as the premier provocateur of new nuclear weapons gold rush.

Maybe getting your ass kicked by Alabama every year wasn’t so bad after all. Say what you will about former Louisiana State head coach Les Myles and his inability to develop a consistent offense and quirky decisions but until 2015, he had the Tigers in contention and his teams were a pipeline for talent moving up to the NFL. Myles was fired last year after a slow start largely attributed to his leap of faith in trying to develop a young quarterback who couldn’t throw and sticking with him long after that it became obvious that he was a liability. Fans had been calling for Myles’ head anyway after a run of futility against powerhouse Alabama that annually relegated LSU to being a non-factor in the national championship picture. But his teams typically took care of business at home which wasn’t the case on Saturday when unheralded Sun Belt Conference team Troy University waltzed into Death Valley and handed the Tigers a humiliating 24-21 loss that wasn’t as close as the final score indicates. Troy? Think that one over Tigers fans, and to make matters even more unbearable, it came on homecoming weekend. It seems like the Trojans weren’t the …

1485,"Raila Odinga, Kenya Opposition Leader, Won’t Run in New Election","With Mr. Odinga’s withdrawal, the judiciary will decide once again what happens next. The court could allow one candidate, Mr. Kenyatta, to run on his own, handing him a victory. Or it could open the vote to weaker candidates who had initially run, which would also be likely to result in a victory for the president.
Or the judges could call for a new election within 60 days, under a ruling allowing a new vote if a contender dies. That could help Mr. Odinga and his party, said Nic Cheeseman, a professor and expert on African democracy at the University of Birmingham in Britain.
“That way, they get another 60 days to build up their steam,” he explained. “They get more campaign financing, and proper electoral reforms are made.”
For the election to take place, Mr. Cheeseman added, “critical compromise” was needed.
“We simply haven’t seen genuine progress on negotiations on how to go forward,” he said.
Analysts have suggested that Mr. Odinga, who is running low on campaign money, is withdrawing from the race for tactical reasons. They speculate that he may not have enough support to win the vote under current conditions and is bowing out to save face.
That may allow him to maintain his legacy as a veteran fighter for democratic reforms and for having instigated the Supreme Court’s historic ruling.
When announcing his withdrawal from the race, Mr. Odinga said it was best for him to pull out, “considering the interests of the people of Kenya, the region and the world at large.”
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
In its ruling, the court singled out the election board for mishandling the original vote. But the same officials are expected to oversee the new vote — an arrangement that Mr. Odinga strongly opposes. Before withdrawing from the race on Tuesday, he repeatedly threatened to boycott the vote if they were not replaced and prosecuted.

Mr. Kenyatta has called the Supreme Court judges “thugs” and vowed to “fix” the judiciary. His Jubilee Party recently introduced amendments to electoral laws that have been widely criticized as efforts to clip the judiciary’s wings.
One amendment would ban the Supreme Court from nullifying a presidential election unless violations of the Constitution or electoral law significantly altered the outcome.
During a campaign tour on Monday, Mr. Kenyatta said his rival was free to withdraw from the race “if he’s not interested.” Kenyans “are tired,” Mr. Kenyatta said. “If he does not want elections, he should keep off and let the country move forward.”
Mr. Kenyatta responded to Mr. Odinga’s announcement on Tuesday by saying that his opponent had exercised his “democratic right” to pull out of the race. But he also described his rival’s withdrawal as “injustice,” saying billions of dollars had already been spent to prepare for the repeat election. “That money would have been used to build roads,” Mr. Kenyatta said.
Patrick Gathara, a Kenyan commentator and a political cartoonist based in Nairobi, called the new developments “the best moment for Kenya’s civic education.”
“People are talking and quoting the Constitution in bars; people are paying attention,” he said, adding: “We’re talking about a crisis, but we’re clarifying the rules and the laws. We’re going into places that make us uncomfortable.”
Still, the uncertainty surrounding the election is increasing frustration among Kenyans and affecting the economy, with far fewer tourists and business deals being made.
“People are getting fed up of politics,” said Wilson Riungu, a cabdriver in Nairobi. “The economy is getting worse day by day. It’s always politics, politics, politics.” He voted for Mr. Kenyatta in August but is now unsure if he will even go to the polls on Election Day, let alone whom he will cast his ballot for.

Western diplomats, who had praised the initial vote, have now condemned Kenya’s political leaders for preventing a smooth and peaceful election.
“If the upcoming election devolves into chaos, the economy, businesses, jobholders and families — all Kenyans — will pay a heavy price,” read a statement from a group of diplomats representing the United States, Britain and the European Union.
The statement criticized Mr. Kenyatta’s proposed amendments but also Mr. Odinga for his demands, saying they undermined the electoral body’s mandate to hold the new vote.",fake
3930,Hundreds of suspected Islamic State militants surrender in Iraq: source,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Hundreds of suspected Islamic State militants surrendered last week to Kurdish authorities after the jihadist group was driven out of its last stronghold in northern Iraq, a Kurdish security official said on Tuesday.
The suspects were part of a group of men who fled toward Kurdish-held lines when Iraqi government forces captured the Islamic State base in Hawija, the official told Reuters, asking not to be identified.
The report of the Sunni Muslim militants fleeing, rather than fighting to the finish as in previous battles, suggested their morale may be crumbling, according to Hisham al-Hashimi, a Baghdad-based expert on Islamic State affairs.
“They no longer seem to believe in the cause,” Hashimi, who met some of those who surrendered in the Dibis camp near Kirkuk, told Reuters.
He said they had fled to the Kurdish-held region to avoid summary executions at the hands of vengeful Sunni Arab tribesmen and Iranian-trained and armed Shi‘ite Muslim paramilitaries who assisted the Iraqi army’s offensive on Hawija.
Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi released an audio recording two weeks ago that indicated he was alive, after several reports he had been killed. He urged his followers to keep up the fight despite setbacks in Iraq and Syria.
“Approximately 1,000 men surrendered over the last week. Not all, however, are terrorists,” said the security official in Erbil, the northern Iraqi base of the autonomous Kurdistan Regional Government.
They handed themselves in to Kurdish Peshmerga forces near the Kurdish-held oil city of Kirkuk, east of Hawija, he said. “It’s fair to say hundreds probably are ISIS (Islamic State) members, but that will be clear after the debriefs.”
FINAL DEFEAT IN SIGHT?
The town of Hawija and surrounding areas fell on Oct. 5 in an offensive by U.S.-backed Iraqi government Shi‘ite paramilitary groups known as Popular Mobilisation, as well as Sunni tribal combatants.
Islamic State’s last territory in Iraq is now a stretch skirting the western border with Syria, including the border town of al-Qaim.
Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said on Tuesday this last piece of territory would be recaptured before the end of the year, marking the final defeat of the militants in Iraq.
The militants also hold areas on the Syrian side of the border, but are retreating there in the face of two sets of hostile forces - a U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led coalition and Syrian government troops with foreign Shi‘ite militias backed by Iran and Russia.
Islamic State’s cross-border “caliphate” effectively collapsed in July when U.S.-backed Iraqi forces captured Mosul, the group’s de facto capital in Iraq, in a nine-month battle.",fake

3488,Yemen's cholera crisis laid bare in new hospital footage,"(CNN) New footage from inside several hospitals in Yemen reveals the crisis facing the war-torn country as it battles to contain one of the world's worst ever outbreaks of cholera.
The videos, provided to CNN by the International Rescue Committee, show children being treated for possible symptoms of the infectious disease in hospitals and mobile health units in the city of Aden and other areas in southern Yemen in late August.
A ravaged health care system, devastated infrastructure and near famine -- the results of a bloody civil war that began in March 2015 -- have all contributed to the spread of what the World Health Organization has described as ""the worst cholera outbreak in the world.""
The United Nations has counted 777,229 suspected cases as of October 2, many of them in children. As of September 13, there were 2,074 known deaths from cholera across the country, according to the WHO, with previous reports estimating that 5,000 people were being infected each day.
Mohammed Alawi Hadi, 6, and his brother Salih Alawi Hadi, 3, are treated for cholera at a hospital in Aden.
Sabah Abdullah Salim, whose 2-year-old son, Mohammed, has cholera, sought help from an IRC mobile hospital in Al Buraiqeh.
She told the IRC that her family fled the ongoing violence only to end up in a village without clean water.
""My son was crying, and he had diarrhea, and he started losing weight, so I brought him (to an IRC mobile hospital team),"" she said in the video. ""This makes me feel sad and stressed. I even cry. I would love to live in a place where there is no war and no illnesses.
""I hope one day we will be able to eat, walk, drink and live happily in our city and not keep on moving from one city to another and watch our kids suffer from different illnesses.""
Cholera is an acute diarrheal illness that kills tens of thousands of people worldwide each year. Infections are contracted by consuming food or water contaminated with the fecal bacteria Vibrio cholerae.
Last week, the head of the International Committee of the Red Cross' delegation to Yemen warned that the number of cholera cases there would reach 1 million by the end of 2017.
Patients are treated at an IRC-run diarrhea treatment center.
""The cholera outbreak in Yemen is one of the worst I have ever seen in my 25 years of working in humanitarian aid,"" said Zvidzai Maburutse, the deputy director of the IRC's Yemen program. ""What is left of the health system in Yemen today is at best inadequate and at worst nonexistent.""
Maburutse, who spoke to CNN from Aden, explained that medicine, medical supplies and materials are in chronically short supply, and well over half of health facilities are only partially functioning or not functioning at all.
""To make matters worse, the local health workers -- those who play the largest role in trying to end this outbreak -- have not been paid their salaries for nearly 10 months, and operational costs in more than 3,500 health facilities are not paid. This cannot continue,"" he said.
JUST WATCHED What is cholera? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH What is cholera? 01:13
The conflict has meant that those who are most vulnerable are often impeded from accessing clean water and sanitation facilities, according to Maburutse, who warned that ""scores of innocent civilians will continue to die each day if new funding is not forthcoming.""
He said that if the $2.3 billion required to help maintain the UN Yemen Humanitarian Response Plan is not found, then the crisis could become far worse.
On Wednesday, the Global Task Force on Cholera Control -- made up of health officials from more than 50 organizations worldwide -- launched a new strategy to reduce cholera deaths by 90% by 2030.
JUST WATCHED UN: Thousands of children are at risk in Yemen Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH UN: Thousands of children are at risk in Yemen 02:18
According to the task force, cholera kills an estimated 95,000 people and affects 2.9 million more every year, and there's a threat that the epidemic in Yemen could spread to neighboring countries.
Though the new approach is likely to be welcomed, the need for action in Yemen is more pressing than ever.
""A lack of access to life-saving basic care will increase the risk of maternal and newborn deaths and communicable disease outbreaks,"" Maburutse said.
""It will lead to excessive -- and most importantly, avoidable -- morbidity and mortality from measles, cholera and diarrhea.
""The longer we wait, the higher the probability that this will spread beyond Yemen's borders.""",fake

Kesen reopened its Buddhist temple on Sunday. A Times photo editor who often chooses the images for our briefings, Hiroko Masuike, was there to capture the moment.
Ms. Masuike has been making twice-yearly visits to document residents’ struggles to rebuild their lives since the disaster, which killed almost 16,000 people and caused nuclear plant meltdowns.
In one of the community’s villages, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and reduced most buildings to rubble.
The disaster’s scars are still visible, Ms. Masuike said. Most residents have moved away, and only about 10 buildings have been rebuilt.
But Kesen’s story is also one of resilience, she said. A monk named Nobuo Kobayashi stayed and, by selling land and accepting donations, rebuilt the 1,100 year-old Buddhist Kongoji Temple on higher ground. Its statues have also been painstakingly restored.

By Dave King -
The big lie that liberals have always used to support the sanctuary city idiocy was that non-violent illegal aliens would not report crimes being committed by violent illegal aliens because the non-violent illegals feared being deported by police. So how well does it serve non-violent illegals when the violent illegals are allowed, by the sanctuary cities and now the state of California, to go unpunished and protected from ICE, and roam the streets preying on other illegals and American citizens alike? The truth of the matter is that when sanctuary is given to violent illegals, the police won’t enforce the law against the violent illegal, as the Kate Steinle murder proves, so the non-violent illegal suffers either way. The real concern of the city, state and the federal government, should be for the safety and welfare of American citizens who are at the mercy of violent, predatory illegals, whom the local police will not and cannot pursue. Unfortunately, that’s not the case. American citizens and non-citizens alike are suffering because of the brain dead liberal insistence that illegal aliens are justified to seek shelter in America and are deserving of relief from their poverty and their lack of education because of …

A response from Murphy's phone number allegedly read, ""I get what you say about my March for life messages. I've never written them. Staff does them. I read them and winced. I told staff don't write any more. I will.""
According to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, the exchange was over ""an unfounded pregnancy scare.""
Murphy’s office and Edwards had no comment when reached by ABC News.
On Wednesday night, Murphy announced his plans to retire at the end of his term in 2018.
""After discussions with my family and staff, I have come to the decision that I will not seek reelection to Congress at the end of my current term,"" Murphy said in a statement. ""In the coming weeks I will take personal time to seek help as my family and I continue to work through our personal difficulties and seek healing. I ask you to respect our privacy during this time.""
Murphy has a record of supporting legislation to cut federal funding for abortion and Planned Parenthood, and co-sponsored the Life at Conception Act on Jan. 24, one day before the text exchange.",fake
1869,‘Trump White House’ Reality Show Recap: An Ex-Wife Claims First Lady Title,"Such media fisticuffs were, until Monday, an unusual move for Melania Trump’s placid, and somewhat sparsely populated, East Wing. But they are second nature to certain members of the Trump family, purveyors of high-profile marital drama since 1992, the year Mr. Trump and Ivana Trump, a former model, ended their marriage in what she called “brutal” divorce negotiations. Mr. Trump’s second wife, Marla Maples, ensured another dizzying round of media attention. (The first Mrs. Trump said in the interview that she does not refer to Ms. Maples by name: She is instead known as “The Showgirl.”)
Melania Trump, a former model born in Slovenia, has been somewhat of a departure because she does not court attention and tends to choose her words carefully. She is also becoming a more visible first lady. In the past few weeks, Mrs. Trump has ramped up her appearances and will travel on Tuesday to Huntington, W.Va., to visit Lily’s Place, an infant recovery center that supports families dealing with addiction.

In recent weeks, Mrs. Trump, who once emphasized that her platform will focus on combating cyberbullying, has shifted her focus to learning more about the opioid epidemic. More than two million Americans are estimated to have problems with the drugs, and Appalachia has some of the highest overdose rates in the country.
“She has stated many times that she wants to utilize her role as first lady to help as many children as she can, with the many issues and challenges they face as they are growing up,” Ms. Grisham said. “The opioid crisis is one of those issues, and is affecting children and their families nationwide.”
In August, Mr. Trump said that the opioid epidemic was a “national emergency,” but the White House has so far not made a formal declaration on the matter. When asked about the first lady’s plans for cyberbullying, Ms. Grisham said that Mrs. Trump’s focus “includes many different aspects of what children face today.”
Ms. Grisham did not respond when asked why Ivana Trump’s interview warranted the East Wing’s response. Among other revelations, the first Mrs. Trump said that she uses her phone calls with the president to encourage discretion — “Sometimes I tell him just not to speak that much,” she said — and that she did not mind if her children engage in the sort of Twitter taunting their father enjoys.
“If they are losers,” Mrs. Trump said of potential Trump family Twitter targets, “they are losers, O.K.? And I don’t mind it.”",fake
3789,Week 4 Rankings (2017): Top 15 Defenses,"Week 4 Rankings (2017): Top 15 Defenses
(Before It's News)
by Ray Kuhn
With Odell Beckham healthy and scoring touchdowns again and the Jets actually winning a game, two of our defensive targets from previous weeks are not as viable as they once were. That doesn’t mean we can’t target either team, or that there aren’t any other teams to target, it just means we need to reevaluate our process a bit. Let’s take a look at how the defenses rank for this week:
Seattle Seahawks – vs. Indianapolis Green Bay Packers – vs. Chicago Cincinnati Bengals – at Cleveland Tampa Bay Buccaneers – vs. New York Giants Tennessee Titans – at Houston Jacksonville Jaguars – at New York Jets Philadelphia Eagles – at LA Chargers Detroit Lions – at Minnesota Arizona Cardinals – vs. San Francisco Kansas City Chiefs – vs. Washington Pittsburgh Steelers – at Baltimore New England Patriots – vs. Carolina Miami Dolphins – vs. New Orleans Dallas Cowboys – vs. LA Rams San Diego Chargers – vs. Philadelphia
Notes:
Just because the Colts got into the win column last week and Jacoby Brissett has emerged as a sneaky, cheap, quarterback option, it doesn’t mean we shouldn’t target Indianapolis. While the Colts did score 31 points last week, it came against the 0-3 Browns and in three games Brissett only has three total touchdowns (one passing and two rushing). Last week was rough for Seattle as the Titans put up 33 points, but in the prior two games they allowed a total of 26 points. Seattle is not as strong of an option as they once were, they are still a solid defense with some of the same players from when they were a top defense off the board. The main issue is that need to create turnovers, with two interceptions. They will also benefit as the Colts have allowed 11 sacks, Seattle has six, which makes them one of the top plays this week.
It has been a forgettable start to the season for New England’s defense. Through three games they have given up an average of 32 points and 461 yards, and the initial thought would be to look the other way. The Patriots get what could turn out to be a gift this week as they face Cam Newton and the Panthers. I’m not sure how much that should count for since New England gave up 27 points to a rookie quarterback last week, but Newton has not looked good and was the first signal caller to struggle against New Orleans’ defense. If you are looking for positives, the Patriots did pick off DeShaun Watson twice last week and they have averaged two sacks a week. I have a hard time betting against New England, and if your streaming options aren’t great there are worse things than holding on. That is especially true, since there aren’t many slam dunk match-ups this week.
This isn’t about targeting the Jets as much as it is giving credit to Jacksonville. After almost shutting out the Ravens last week, perhaps the Jaguars defense is truly a legitimate fantasy option for this season. When they held the Texans to just seven points in the season opener while coming up with an interception, three fumble recoveries and scoring a touchdown, that was chalked up to Tom Savage more than anything else. It looked like the bounced back to earth in a big way by giving up 37 points to the Titans, but it’s hard to argue with the success they had last week. Despite the 20 points New York scored last week, they are still not an intimidating offense.

2290,"5 things for October 10: California wildfires, Las Vegas shooting","(CNN) Catalonia may declare independence from Spain today. Here's what else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and Out the Door . (You can also get ""5 Things You Need to Know Today"" delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here .)
1. California wildfires
Fifteen wildfires scorched Northern California and left at least 10 people dead in blazes that also burned through the state's beloved wine country. The wildfires -- which started Sunday night and were aided by both dry conditions and high winds -- burned over 119,000 acres and torched more than 1,500 homes and businesses. More than 20,000 people were evacuated. The hardest-hit area seemed to be Santa Rosa, where seven of the deaths were reported. And officials warn the death toll is likely to rise: one county alone received more than 100 missing person reports.
2. Las Vegas shooting
Police have made a pretty big change to the known timeline of events in the shooting. They now say a security guard was shot six minutes before gunman Stephen Paddock began shooting concertgoers from his Mandalay Bay hotel room on the 32nd floor. Jesus Campos, who was investigating an alarm in another room on the same floor, was shot at 9:59 p.m. Paddock started his nearly 11-minute shooting rampage at 10:05 p.m.
This change is significant because police originally thought Campos was shot as the attack was already underway. They had believed Paddock stopped shooting because Campos diverted his attention when he neared the gunman's room. Now they don't know what made Paddock stop shooting, an attack that left 58 people dead and hundreds injured.

3. Russia investigation
An attorney for the Russian billionaire who allegedly pushed for the June 2016 meeting between senior members of Trump's team and a Russian lawyer says he has documents showing the meeting wasn't really about dirt on Hillary Clinton.
An email exchange and talking points provided to CNN are the latest indication of how some of the meeting participants plan to make their case about why the meeting with Donald Trump Jr. did not amount to collusion between Russian officials and the Trump campaign. The new information stands in contrast with the initial email pitching the meeting to Trump Jr., which promised damaging information on Clinton.

4. Environmental Protection Agency
The Trump administration is taking down another part of Barack Obama's legacy. This time it's the Clean Power Plan, an Obama-era rule regulating greenhouse gas emissions. The EPA plans to repeal the plan , which requires states to meet specific carbon emission reduction standards based on their individual energy consumption. EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt has said the rule is bureaucratic overreach and will cost jobs. Environmental groups vowed a fight over this in the courts.

5. Tropical Storm Ophelia
The remnants of Hurricane Nate barely had time to exit the weather stage before Tropical Storm Ophelia formed . Ophelia, the 15th named storm of this active hurricane season, is churning away hundreds of miles west of the Azores Islands, but forecasters say at this point, the storm is not a threat to land. Ophelia will strengthen, though, and become a hurricane on Friday, making it the 10th hurricane of 2017.

2007,Kaspersky works with Interpol; Kremlin dismisses claims against firm,"The logo of the anti-virus firm Kaspersky Lab is seen at its headquarters in Moscow, Russia September 15, 2017. REUTERS/Sergei Karpukhin
(Reuters) - Russian cyber security firm Kaspersky Lab said on Thursday that it has expanded its relationship with global law enforcement agency Interpol, agreeing to share threat data to help police fight cyber crime.
The company disclosed the agreement as the Kremlin dismissed claims by several U.S. newspapers that Israeli intelligence officials had determined that Russian government hackers were using Kaspersky’s software for espionage. The reports were the latest in a series alleging the company and its founder, Eugene Kaspersky, have close ties to the Kremlin.
Reuters has not been able to validate those claims.
Kaspersky has repeatedly said it has not helped Russia or any other government engage in espionage.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday the Russian government believes the allegations against Kaspersky are without merit.
He said that allegations, in articles in the New York Times, Washington Post and Wall Street Journal, were “absurd.”
”The government has not had and does not have any connection to such activity,“ he said. ”The accusations are ungrounded and unproven.”",fake

% of readers think this story is Fact. Add your two cents.
(Before It's News)
It’s a matchup of disappointing teams that are both dealing with some key injuries as the Ravens head to Oakland to take on the Raiders. The Ravens last won in “The Black Hole” in Week 17 of the 2009 season, losing in their only other game there in the John Harbaugh era back in 2015.
Let’s take a look at this week’s stats, quotes, and more,c/o Casa Mia’s White Marsh.
KNOW THY ENEMY
SERIES HISTORY
QUOTES OF THE WEEK
S Eric Weddle on the Ravens’ Mindset Going Forward:
“It’s a long season. No one’s pressing the panic button. We’re just not playing well enough to win in all three phases. That’s the bottom line, so we’ll get back to work, look at our mistakes, get a great game plan and get ready to go out there again, because no one’s going to feel sorry for us. This league is ruthless. If you’re down, they’re going to keep you down, and they want to stomp you out. We’ll fight, and guys are getting better. We believe in this team. The belief is there, we just all need to get a little bit better. If everyone gets a little bit better, we’ll start faster and be able to win these games.”
Pittsburgh head coach Mike Tomlin on what sets OLB Terrell Suggs apart from other defenders:
“I think it’s his football intelligence. His physical talents are what they are, and they are well-documented. He is athletic. He is powerful. But his awareness, his feel for the game is displayed statistically in the number of passes that he bats and the fact that he is always not just playing for a sack, but that he is a ball-aware guy; he is a sack-fumble guy. I think his football intelligence is on display in just about every element of his game. He is a very aware player. He makes plays because of that. He has very good hands and eyes.”
LB C.J. Mosley on coming off two tough losses:
“As a leadership and as a team, we’ve got to see what our weaknesses are. We’ve got to correct it quickly. Even though it seems like the season is over, we’re 2-2, and it’s only Week 4, and we’ve got another AFC opponent this week, a great team in Oakland. It’s going to be a tough road game. We’ve got to look at it, correct the mistakes and get ready to play.”
WR Mike Wallace on the offense finding a way to click:
“It’s always frustrating when you can’t score points. With the talent that we have on offense, it’s crazy. We have so many players and so many weapons – we’re just not making plays. We just have to find a way. A quarter of the season is gone, and our offense just hasn’t found ways to make plays. I know that we will. I’m more than confident that we will. We’ve got to find a way to do it. We’ve got to get it going.”
RB Alex Collins on whether the three-man RB rotation allows him to get into a rhythm:
“Definitely. It doesn’t get me out of a rhythm. We’re all fresh, and we all get to ground and pound at the same time. And it gives us an opportunity to be the fresh guy out there. That’s what we do in practice, and we just carry it over into the game.”
GETTING TO KNOW YOU ~ Q&A with Ronnie Stanley
Can you talk about your involvement with Baltimore Animal Rescue and Care Shelter (BARCS)?
“It advocates ‘adopt, don’t shop.’ The organization raises awareness of overpopulation and abusive relationships that a lot of people have with their pets and animals, in general.”
You adopted your dog, right?
“Yes, two of them. One’s a pit bull, and one’s a pit bull/mastiff puppy. I just got the puppy this year, and he’s a lot. Their names are Rico and Lola.”
This summer you connected with former Raven and Hall of Famer Jonathan Ogden. What was that like?
“It was really cool. He’s from my home state, so when I went home, we hung out. He worked out with me a little bit. I went out golfing with him and his son. He’s been a great mentor and has guided me along the way.”
Did Ogden give you advice for 2017?
“He said to keep improving. He was very happy with what I was doing. He was just telling me to keep trying to improve and to keep doing what I’m doing.”
Do you golf often?
“I don’t, but I want to. I was excited when Jonathan Ogden asked me to go golfing because I want to learn [how to play]. I want to learn from someone who knows how to play, and I know he knows how to play. He actually taught me how to hit the ball. So, that was cool.”
What’s the difference between Year 1 and Year 2?
“In Year 2, I definitely feel more comfortable, just understanding my teammates and who everyone is, their personalities. It’s allowed me to be myself.”
What advice would you give to other young players that you might have learned in your rookie year?
“Be a good rookie. When I say that, I mean don’t talk much; just do what you’re told. It’ll come along from there. You’ll get more freedoms as you perform. You do your job first, and the other fun stuff will happen later.”
Describe O-line coach Joe D’Alessandris in one word.
“Upbeat.”
If you could play any other position other than your own, what would it be?
“Defensive end. That’s a fun position. You make sacks, and even if you don’t make a sack, you don’t really get in trouble.”
What has been the toughest stadium to play in?
“From college, it was at Michigan. That was brutal. There were over 100,000 people there. It’s a big stadium, and [Michigan] oversold the game because it was [Notre Dame’s] last game playing there. There’s a huge rivalry between us, and it was a night game. I couldn’t hear anything.”
HEY, YOU LOOK FAMILIAR ~ Key Connections
Raiders G Kelechi Osemele signed with Oakland during the 2016 offseason after spending four years (2012-15) with the Ravens. (He was drafted by Baltimore in the second round.)
Ravens G/C Tony Bergstrom (2012 & 2015) and T Austin Howard (2014-16) both played on the Raiders’ O-line. Howard appeared in 40 games (39 starts) in his three years in Oakland.
Raiders head coach Jack Del Rio guided the Ravens’ LBs from 1999- 2001, while cornerbacks coach Rod Woodson played four seasons (1998-2001) in Charm City. Both earned Super Bowl rings with the Ravens in 2000.

1109,4chan Las Vegas Shooter Prophecy and Shooter a Crisis Actor at Sandy Hook? (Video),"(Before It's News)
 
 
 
 
 
Is this the same guy? I know a lot of people look the same. I also do not believe every person that died in Las Vegas was an actor. Do I think maybe some weirdo black ops stuff involved? Sure anything is possible. Someone may have did this to spark a civil war between left and right. Lots of different theories out there right now. Lots of infiltrated news from our real enemies I am sure. What do you think is this the same guy really? I don’t know honestly.
 
Now let us get to the 4chan prophetic part of this post revolving the Las Vegas Shootings. The following details the information regarding this connection the source of Squawker.org
Emigrate While You Still Can! Learn More...
 
3 weeks ago, on 9/11 a mysterious 4chan user who went only by “John” made a series of at the time overlooked posts. He warned users to stay away from any gatherings of large groups of people in the Vegas or nearby Henderson areas. Stating that he had insider knowledge of what he referred to as a “high incident project” that was set to occur soon.While the poster was ignored at the time, since nothing seemed to occur on the 12th. The fact this John wrote “I can’t guarantee anything will happen tomorrow but las vegas is on their minds,” seems almost frightening now that just a few weeks later the largest mass shooting in American history has occurred at this very location. If we even consider the idea there could be any truth to such a plot in the first place, its not really all that unreasonable to believe the organizers could have simply adjusted there schedule by a few weeks. This could have been done for a myriad of reasons including just simply deciding the concert target eventually chosen served their purposes better. If true though even more troubling is the profit minded motivation behind the shooting that John went on to describe.He states this “project” will be done with an endgame goal of passing new laws in Nevada regarding casino security. Making pricey new security screening machines mandatory for all guests. With even further more ambitious plans to follow suit in our schools and other public buildings if the public goes along with the casino machines easily enough. He also specifically names former head of the Department of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff and Casino owner and billionaire Sheldon Adelson as the two men set to profit most off the wave of new regulations set to spring up in response to the Vegas incident. It’s not all that unreasonable even to believe that Mr. Chertoff might seek to profit from a new security panic in the wake of Vegas. Given that the man has already been accused of abusing the public trust by raising security fears among average American’s in an attempt to sell his companies body scanners before, all the way back in 2010.
 
While the media paints the shooter Stephen Paddock as a lone wolf type and seems mystified over the possible motivations for a man, who the media and FBI at least keep claiming had no religious or strong political ideologies. A new theory has been emerging in the wake of the revelations above. With new information now breaking that the shooter was a rather active vegas gambler with recent large transactions to his name. Could Stephen have simply been threatened into doing this horrible act by some third party, in the name of paying off some possible large gambling debts? His family as well may have been threatened. If Stephen wasn’t acting of his own accord, then a number of the seemingly unexplained parts to this whole story do start making a lot more sense.
 
Even if this is all one giant coincidence. The fact does remain that people like Chertoff and those behind similar companies do stand to profit quite nicely in the months to come from the new security panic this incident will likely produce. Recent headlines related to the topic going to prove this point nicely.

On Sept. 29, 2013, the Baltimore Ravens lost to the Buffalo Bills and their rookie quarterback EJ Manuel, 20-13, in Orchard Park, N.Y.
However, Manuel was not the difference in that game.
Instead, Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco threw five interceptions, including one on a potential game-tying scoring drive in the fourth quarter. It was an all-around poor performance by the Ravens, who missed tackles, dropped passes and committed several careless penalties.
It’s been a familiar script for both of the team’s losses here in 2017, four years later.
On Sunday, the Ravens get another crack at Manuel, who was named the Raiders’ starter with Derek Carr out with a back injury.
The Ravens appear to have caught a break, because Carr has torched their defense over the past two seasons. Last year at M&T Bank Stadium, Carr threw four touchdown passes, including the go-ahead score to Michael Crabtree with 2:12 left in the game, paving the way for Oakland’s 28-27 victory.
However, it doesn’t matter who starts at quarterback for Oakland if the Ravens can’t find a way to play better on both sides of the ball. Otherwise, Manuel might improve to 2-0 against them.
Earlier this week, Flacco took full responsibility for the team’s recent woes. In four games this season, Flacco has completed just 73 of 118 pass attempts for 601 yards with four touchdowns and six interceptions. He is hoping this week will be different.
“I think I’ve been a little bit quick to get the ball out of my hands, at times,” Flacco said. “I think if I just hang in there and trust the process, trust the pocket … I might have to step up and make some plays here and there. I think when some of those big plays are presented to us – they’re there, they’ve been pretty easy; you can make them in your sleep – and we haven’t made them. I think the combination of those three things can definitely go a long way.”
While Flacco has struggled to make plays, the loss of offensive lineman Marshal Yanda has clearly hampered the team. Flacco has been sacked six times over the recent two-game losing streak, prompting more questions about his health.
The offensive line will literally have its hands full again on Sunday. Oakland defensive ends Khalil Mack and Mario Edwards Jr. have combined for seven sacks and will spend the afternoon trying to make life miserable for Flacco and his injury-marred offensive line.
The Ravens are fully aware of that challenge.
“They have a number of pass rushers. It is not just those guys. ‘96’ [Denico Autry] is a really good pass rusher, too,” Harbaugh said. “They have a number of guys that can get to the quarterback. They get good push from their nose guard and from their three-technique. It is a very good front five; it is a very good front seven.”
On the other side of the ball, the Ravens have given up 339 yards on the ground in the past two games with nose tackle Brandon Williams out of the lineup with a foot injury. Williams is still unable to practice this week and that could spell further trouble. Even though Raiders running back Marshawn Lynch has struggled to make plays this season, he is fully capable of a break-out performance.
In short, this is shaping up to be another tough game for the Ravens. The cross-country trip is not going to help. Under Harbaugh, Baltimore is just 3-5 on the West Coast.
Luckily, Oakland is not as far as London.

1806,ChiCitySports Fantasy Review: Week 4 DFS Picks,"ChiCitySports Fantasy Review: Week 4 DFS Picks
(Before It's News)
Whatever you want to call Thursday night’s tilt between the Bears and Packers, Week 4 is off and running. To get you prepped for this weekend’s games, here’s a few players to look out for in DFS that could help you lock down your contests and put a little cash in your pocket. Quarterback Andy Dalton, Cincinnati Bengals – Dalton has had five games in which he’s thrown more multiple touchdowns since 2016. Two of those were against the Browns last season. In Dalton’s last four games against Cleveland, the lowest passer rating he’s produced is 112 and the Bengals averaged 30 points in those games. Last week, Cleveland just made Jacoby Brissett look like a pro bowler and TY Hilton thived. It’s going to be a big game for the Red Rifle. ($5,800 DraftKings/$7,100 FanDuel) Eli Manning - The Giants finally got their offense working in sync last week, plus it always helps when you have a healthy Odell Beckham. Facing Tampa defense without Lavonte David and a hobbled Gerald McCoy is a welcome sight, let alone the Bucs have allowed over 300 yards to passers in each of their first two games this year – that includes Mike Glennon despite his turnovers. Along with Dalton, Manning also provides a good stacking option with two of his receivers this week in Shepard and OBJ who face plus matchups against the Tampa secondary. ($5,700 DraftKings/$7,000 FanDuel) Honorable Mention: Deshaun Watson, Trevor Siemian Running Back Christian McCaffrey, Carolina Panthers – Carolina’s matchup with the Patriots will probably be very similar to their script against New Orleans. Lots of catchup time. Not only is New England giving up the second most points to running backs this season, offering up over 5 yards a carry, they offer up the second most receiving yards to running backs this season. If Benjamin is out, McCaffrey will flirt with the 100-yard mark again. ($6,800 DraftKings/$6,400 FanDuel) Joe Mixon, Cincinnati Bengals – We saw Mixon get his 18 carries last week against Green Bay, but this week may be the breakout everyone has been waiting for. Cleveland yields 2.3 yards per carry before contact to opponents this year, and while the Bengals’ offensive line is nothing to write home about, everything points in the direction of Mixon having another big day on the ground. There is one lone concern here among all the positives: although the Browns are allowing a touchdown on 80% of red zone drives to this point, Jeremy Hill may vulture a touch or two at the goal line, and Cleveland has let every rush from inside the five-yard line score for a touchdown this season. ($5,700 DraftKings/$5,600 FanDuel) Honorable Mention: Jay Ajayi, Chris Carson Wide Receiver Larry Fitzgerald, Arizona Cardinals – If you thought Fitz had a fantastic game against Dallas on Monday night, wait for Sunday’s showdown with San Francisco. While the Niners have been towards the middle of the pack against wide receivers this year, the man going up against Fitzgerald on Sunday has been awful: cornerback K’Waun Williams. Only one starting corner in the league gets targeted more than Williams does when in coverage. Couple this with the fact that the Cardinals have continued to play the dink and dunk passing game thanks to a bad offensive line and David Johnson still isn’t around, consider the all-time great Cardinal the main beneficiary yet again this week. ($6,100 DraftKings/$6,700 FanDuel) Jamison Crowder, Washington Redskins – The million-dollar fantasy question these first three weeks has been “What’s wrong with the Redskins’ receivers?”. I wish I knew the answer to that, but at least one of them should get back on track this week and that’s Crowder. Terrelle Pryor is going to be fighting with Marcus Peters for the majority of the day which should turn Cousins’ attention to his slot receiver. The Chiefs have struggled with covering the slot thus far and it should continue. ($5,400 DK/$6,100 FD) Honorable Mention: Sterling Shepard, Michael Thomas, Golden Tate Tight End Charles Clay, Buffalo Bills – If one thing has been for certain, Tyrod Taylor loves his security blanket that he has in Charles Clay. Now Buffalo goes into Atlanta facing a Falcons team that has seen more targets to tight ends than any other team in the league. What they have done a good job of is limit the yards after catch, which Clay is 6th among all tight ends. Bills will more than likely be playing catchup all day and Clay should be the beneficiary. Not to mention since Week 12 last year, Clay is TE3. Shows how volatile the position has been. ($3,700 DraftKings/$5,300 FanDuel) Jared Cook, Oakland Raiders – The Denver Broncos have been known for their defensive prowess the for the past several years, but in 2017 the same cannot be said for their play against tight ends. Ranked 27th against the position thus far, Jared Cook finds himself in a very friendly matchup. Cook rarely stays in on the play to block this year, and he’ll be facing safety Will Parks on a fair amount of his matchups this week. Parks is one of the most targeted players when covering tight ends in 2017, let alone he allows catches on 71% of those routes. ($3,400 DraftKings/$5,500 FanDuel) Honorable Mention: Zach Ertz, Benjamin Watson, Jimmy Graham Defense/Special Teams Jacksonville Jaguars – This is the no brainer play. Jacksonville leads the league in pressure on the quarterback this season and converts those pressures into sacks nearly a quarter of the time. Add that to a Jets’ offensive line that has struggled to stave off pressure, you have yourself a very solid matchup, let alone no wide receiver has recorded more than 55 yards against them this season. ($3,600 DraftKings/$5,200 FanDuel) Cincinnati Bengals – Feeling the Bengals theme yet? While the offensive line has been nothing to brag about, the defensive line is another story. Cincy is 2nd in pressure rating on the quarterback and allows the 5th least amount of yards gained before contact. All in all: they’re going to make their presence know. Rattling Deshone Kizer should be an easy task and lead to a turnover or two, if not more. Once again, the Cleveland Browns are the punching bag of the NFL. ($3,500 DraftKings/$4,600 FanDuel)

1113,Artificial Intelligence - The Innovators and Disruptors for next generation digital transformation,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has become a key driving force for next generation innovation. Research has shown various examples of successful problem solving and the advent of high-performance computing power has led to A.I. being used in a wide spectrum of applications. There are already many commercial applications of A.I. and many corporates are competing with one another to own related IP initiatives.
English mathematician Alan Turing first introduced the concept of machine intelligence in 1950. Since then, the theoretical perspective of A.I. had been actively researched in mathematics, logic, cognitive science and life science to name a few. The advent of computing technology in the late 1990s helped the field of A.I. to leapfrog in research and demonstrated the possibility for various applications.
Figure 1 shows the research landscape of artificial intelligence spanning multiple research areas including recognition such as data classification or pattern recognition, diagnosis of abnormality, natural language processing, autonomous driving, articifial life and algorithm research. The analysis is based on the top 15,000 Highly Cited Papers of A.I. research indexed in the Web of Science for the past 10 years.
Many countries are actively conducting A.I. research. Early research was largely led by the US, but China has been prolific in published research since 2000. In Asia Pacific, Japan, Korea and Australia are also actively conducting A.I. research.
In A.I., Machine Learning has demonstrated strong business cases to enhance system intelligence. Machine learning involves computer preprocessing of input data about the target environment and recognition of key characteristics of a given dataset. Since recognizing the environment before making a decision is a basic trait of intelligence, machine learning can be used in a variety of applications. Figure 3 shows technology category analysis of Machine Learning patents spanning not just computer algorithms but also automobile, medicine and biotechnology. This shows that Machine Learning is the driving force of technology innovation in many industries.
There are still many research areas where we can use and improve A.I. to solve actual, complex problems that we face today. Although a great deal of research has been conducted by research institutions and universities, corporates continue to own a massive volume of patents on artificial intelligence. The most ideal scenario would be to position the research community as the collaborator for corporates rather than as their competitor. As A.I. will play a critical role in technology innovation, research institutions should also place more emphasis on filing patent applications related to artificial intelligence.

2155,Prosecution rests in Bob Menendez corruption trial,"Newark, New Jersey (CNN) Prosecutors rested their federal corruption case against Sen. Bob Menendez Wednesday, capping off weeks of a trial that could determine the political future of the New Jersey Democrat.
Over 18 days of testimony from 35 witnesses, prosecutors have tried to establish a ""quid pro quo"" bribery theory that they set forth during open arguments.
""This case is about a corrupt politician who sold his Senate office for a life of luxury he couldn't afford,"" said prosecutor Peter Koski. ""And a greedy doctor who put that politician on his payroll for when he needed the services of a United States senator.""
Menendez and his co-defendant, Dr. Salomon Melgen, deny the charges and say prosecutors have wrongly twisted a 25-year friendship into a federal crime.
""It's a story of a lifetime of service done honorably, hard work and sacrifice and a commitment to the people of New Jersey and a longtime friendship with Dr. Melgen,"" Menendez told reporters walking into court Wednesday.
Menendez has not said he would resign if convicted and insisted his poll numbers ""will rise"" if he's acquitted.
""I have no intention of being anything but exonerated,"" he told CNN last week . ""So therefore, I'm not contemplating anything but reelection next year.""
The heart of the Justice Department's case rests on accusations that Menendez accepted political contributions, free rides on private jets and a swanky hotel suite in Paris from Melgen in exchange for agreeing to pressure other high-level federal officials in the executive branch to help resolve Melgen's business problems -- ""official acts"" prosecutors claim put Menendez on the hook under federal bribery law.
Over the past week, prosecutors have specifically tried to focus on the timeline of $600,000 donations Melgen made to a Democratic super PAC, earmarked for the state of New Jersey, in 2012 during the time witnesses say and emails show Menendez tried to help the doctor resolve a multimillion-dollar billing dispute with Medicare in Melgen's favor.
The jury also saw email correspondence from May 2012 showing Melgen's representative agreeing to donate $60,000 to Menendez's legal defense fund and the New Jersey Democratic State Committee -- the same day that Menendez requested a meeting with a high-ranking official at the State Department to discuss a port security issues in the Dominican Republic.
Melgen had acquired a contract with the government in the Dominican Republic for screening cargo at the island's ports, but the agreement had turned sour and prosecutors have tried to convince jurors that Menendez sought to influence others to resolve the dispute in Melgen's favor.
The defense team has tried to illustrate through cross-examination of several witnesses that Menendez was legitimately concerned about the fairness of Medicare's billing practices, security of cargo entering the US and preventing drug smuggling at ports, and never hid his friendship with Melgen.
Legal experts say proving ""corrupt intent"" remains the major obstacle for prosecutors in this case, especially if the defense offers a persuasive counter-narrative for the jury to believe Menendez genuinely acted out of broader policy concerns, not because Melgen paid him off.
As Columbia Law School Professor Richard Briffault explained in an interview with CNN, the more the defense team convinces the jury that Menendez acted because he thought something was a ""good idea"" rather than doing it because there was a ""deal"" with Melgen, the harder it will be for the jury to convict.

""Stream of benefits""
After the prosecution rested its case, defense attorney Abbe Lowell urged Judge William Walls to dismiss the case and enter a judgment of acquittal Wednesday based on a failure of the Justice Department to meet its burden of proof.
Walls did not rule on the motion but appeared unpersuaded. For over three hours of argument, the judge engaged in a spirited debate with both sides about the applicability of a 2016 Supreme Court decision throwing out former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell's bribery conviction.
In that case, the justices said that merely ""setting up a meeting, hosting an event, or calling an official"" is no longer sufficient -- the politician must put his or her thumb on the scale in an ongoing proceeding, lawsuit or controversy, or ""exert pressure"" on someone else to do so.
Lowell suggested that Menendez's conduct did not meet the court's threshold for what now constitutes an ""official act"" under federal bribery law, because the senator (as a member of the legislative branch) has only been accused of lobbying executive branch officials on Melgen's behalf.
But Walls rejected that argument, noting that the McDonnell case didn't rule out the possibility of inter-branch pressure and ""historically, as well as in literature, the power of senators, particularly senators, is acknowledged.""
The judge additionally pushed prosecutors to articulate how their ""quid pro quo"" bribery theory -- a Latin phrase meaning ""this for that"" -- jives with the McDonnell decision.
""What's the quid for these quos?"" Walls asked. ""I'm trying to establish a temporal line -- how you link the quids to the alleged quos.""
Koski emphasized that the prosecution's overarching theory -- that Melgen provided a ""stream of benefits"" -- survives the McDonnell test, but the judge seemed skeptical and asked the lawyers provide written briefs on the issue.

3276,California fires: At least 21 dead as hundreds reported missing,"(CNN) Firefighters battling deadly blazes in Northern California faced a daunting challenge Wednesday: Winds picked back up, threatening to spread wildfires that already have killed 21 people, destroyed hundreds of buildings and forced thousands of evacuations.
Most of the fires were ignited Sunday, driven by winds of up to 79 mph and dry conditions. The winds died down early this week, but gusts of 20 to 40 mph were seen Wednesday, the humidity was extremely low, and no rain is forecast for the next few days.
In hard-hit Sonoma County, Sheriff Rob Giordano said his office has received 600 reports of missing people, of which detectives have been able to locate 315 people. Giordano believes many of the 285 people who are unaccounted for will be located once telecommunications issues are solved, but he also fears more bodies will be found.
More than 20,000 people had been ordered to evacuate as of Wednesday, and authorities were encouraging others to pack ""ready-to-go bags"" with documents and medicines in case they had to flee the fast-spreading flames on a moment's notice.
Giordano had a suggestion Wednesday for people who'd been advised to be prepared to leave: Go anyway.
""Traffic is bad in the county. If we have to evacuate people, it'd be better to have you (already) out of the area. If you have a place to go, go,"" he said.
""We are very concerned about all the fire lines, because of the wind they're anticipating,"" he said.

Latest developments
• Wildfires have burned nearly 170,000 acres in California. The largest fires were in Northern California's Sonoma, Napa and Mendocino counties, filling the picturesque landscape of the state's wine country with charred rubble and clouds of smoke.
• Of the 21 people who have died since Sunday night, 11 were killed in the Tubbs wildfire in Sonoma County, officials said. That makes the Tubbs fire, one of 22 blazes burning in the state, the sixth-deadliest fire in recorded California history, authorities said.
• People who left evacuation zones in Sonoma County aren't yet allowed to return, Giordano said.
• Officials said Wednesday that almost 8,000 firefighters are involved in trying to contain the blazes. The equipment being used includes 550 fire trucks -- at least 170 of which came from out of state -- 73 helicopters and more than 30 planes.
Scores missing
Families are frantically searching for those who have been reported missing. Authorities believe communications issues are preventing many of those people from checking in with relatives.
But one family's search for a loved one in Santa Rosa ended tragically.
Christina Hanson, 28, who used a wheelchair and lived in an apartment next to her father's house, was reported missing after the fire. Hanson had called her father's ex-wife to say she saw flames , but no one had heard from her after that, her family said.
After a day of panic and uncertainty, Hanson's cousin confirmed she had died in the fire.
Couple, 100 and 98, killed
Also among the dead were a couple who relatives said had known each other for nearly 90 years: Charles Rippey, 100, and his wife, Sara, 98.
Charles and Sara Rippey in an undated photo supplied by their son Mike.
They died shortly after the Atlas fire -- now one of the largest, at more than 42,000 acres -- began Sunday night, engulfing their home near the Silverado Country Club north of Napa, Napa County spokeswoman Kristi Jourdan said.
""This house was one of the first ones hit (in the subdivision),"" their son Mike Rippey told CNN affiliate KPIX on Tuesday.
The couple met each other in grade school in Wisconsin and began a family together after Charles served in World War II, the son told KPIX. They relocated to California after living in the Midwest and on the East Coast, he said.
The son said he believed his father was trying to save his mother when the fire struck.""From where they found his body, he was trying to get from his room to her room,"" he told KPIX. ""He never made it. ... There is no way he would have left (without her).""
Elsewhere in the county, part of a veterans home in Yountville, near Napa, was evacuated Tuesday night over fears of approaching flames, but the fire changed directions, so the rest of the residents will stay put for now, Napa Mayor Jill Techel said. Only the most frail -- those in a nursing facility -- left the property in the initial evacuation, Techel said.
""We are set up with buses and everything we need to do if we get the call that a part of town or a part of Napa needs to be evacuated,"" Techel said.
Minutes to escape
The Tubbs fire reduced cars and homes into burnt piles of ash and rubble in parts of Santa Rosa, a city of about 175,000 roughly 50 miles northwest of San Francisco.

That fire has burned 27,363 acres and destroyed at least 576 structures between Santa Rosa and the Calistoga area, Cal Fire said Wednesday. It is 10% contained.
A large part of Santa Rosa was evacuated. In the city's Coffey Park neighborhood, homes are in ruins -- the fire seemed to consume everything that wasn't steel, concrete or brick. At some properties, all that is recognizable are the remains of washers, dryers and water heaters.
Zach Block's house is among those destroyed in Santa Rosa. He said he woke up early Monday to the smell of smoke.
He, his wife, his 11-month-old daughter and his brother escaped -- but not before he tried to save the house.
""Within 10 minutes, my brother and I were out in the backyard with the hoses and trying to fight off as much as we could, and then we had to evacuate within five minutes of the fire touching down on the backyard,"" he told CNN's ""New Day"" on Wednesday.

1246,Her body was attacking her brain,"(CNN) Emily Gavigan was convinced that a nearby truck was following her. Someone was after her.
She was a sophomore at the University of Scranton in January 2009 when the ""bizarre"" behavior began, said her father, Bill.
Her parents noticed that she had been rambling, not making any sense. At one point, she called her family and friends to warn them: Something terrible was going to happen to all of them.
""Emily was like a different person. We didn't know who she was,"" Bill Gavigan said. ""We had gone from having this daughter who was perfectly normal, happy, vibrant ... with a bright future ahead.
""All of a sudden, this all came crashing down.""
Then, one day, Gavigan disappeared.
""We didn't know where she was for more than 24 hours,"" her father said.
She had gotten in her car and driven from Pennsylvania to New Jersey with no money. She went right through toll booths without paying. But she eventually found her way back to her grandparents' house, still convinced that she was being followed.
Her grandfather peered out the window, looking for something suspicious. But they soon realized there was no one after her.
""I get emotional when I think about it,"" said Gavigan's grandfather Joseph Chiumento.
Her parents showed up and took her to the hospital.
Emily Gavigan began exhibiting odd behavior when she was 19, which doctors mistook for a mental illness.
Say, 'I love you, dad'
Doctors initially thought Gavigan had a mental illness. She spent time in different psychiatric facilities, which made her family uneasy. One in particular reminded her father of the movie ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.""
""They just kept trying medication after medication after medication, and none of it worked,"" Bill Gavigan said.
Things kept getting worse. There was some numbness in her face and hands, and she would develop seizures. Doctors went looking for something that might be wrong with her brain -- a tumor, perhaps -- but found none. She was misdiagnosed with multiple sclerosis but continued to decline.
In a video that the Gavigan family shared with CNN, Bill asks his daughter how she's feeling today. She opens her mouth, and her tongue moves like she's about to respond.
""Say, 'I love you, dad,' "" he nudges.
She shakes her head weakly. No.
Twist of fate
A year after Gavigan started having symptoms, her family noticed something peculiar on an episode of NBC's ""Today"" show. The guest was Susannah Cahalan , a reporter at the New York Post who had written an article about her ""mysterious lost month of madness.""
""Who knows how many people out there are suffering from what I suffered from and are just not getting the diagnosis that they need?"" Cahalan told the talk show hosts.
Cahalan's story sounded familiar to the Gavigans. She had become paranoid and exhibited odd behavior, just like Emily. She became convinced that she had bed bugs, and she could feel them on her left hand and face, according to neurologist Dr. Souhel Najjar, who treated Cahalan.
But Najjar had a hunch that Cahalan might have a neurological problem, not a purely psychiatric one.
So he asked asked Cahalan to draw a clock, and she drew all the numbers bunched up on the right side. This alone couldn't make a diagnosis, but it clued doctors in that something could be misfiring on the right side of her brain.
That something, it turned out, could be treated.
The wrong target
The key to making the right diagnosis is a simple test on the blood or spinal fluid, Najjar said. You just have to know what you're looking for: a type of antibody.
To fight off disease, the immune system makes antibodies, Y-shaped proteins that attack foreign invaders like bacteria or viruses. But sometimes, those proteins can attack our own bodies. This is known as autoimmune disease.
In Cahalan's case, those antibodies were directed against a receptor in her brain: the NMDA receptor, which plays a role in how brain cells communicate with each other. The receptor takes part in the brain's normal functioning, from memory to breathing.
The disease was given a name in 2007: anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis, or NMDARE for short. Had Cahalan had the disease a few years prior, there would have been no diagnosis to give her.
""The disease is definitely not new,"" said Dr. Josep Dalmau, a neurologist at the University of Pennsylvania who is credited with discovering the disease.
Many patients have been misdiagnosed with schizophrenia and other mental illnesses, Dalmau said. Some have been admitted to psychiatric units, where they were given medications, electroconvulsive therapies and other treatments that probably made their symptoms worse, he added.
There are over 15 known types of autoimmune encephalitis, according to the Autoimmune Encephalitis Alliance. Meaning the immune system can attack other brain receptors, too.
Thousands and thousands of cases
Dr. Belinda Lennox, a psychiatrist and researcher at the University of Oxford, believes that we should be testing for autoimmune encephalitis more routinely. After she learned about NMDARE, she wondered how many of her own patients might have it.
""It seemed to me a very simple, straightforward thing just to test the people in my service using the same blood test,"" she said.
Among the first 46 patients Lennox tested, all with their first episodes of psychosis, three tested positive for the antibody. Based on symptoms alone, those patients looked no different from the other 43.
""That was the alarming bit,"" she said. ""They didn't stand out.""
Lennox published these findings in 2011. In December, she published another study in The Lancet Psychiatry of 228 patients with first-episode psychosis. She found that 9% of the patients had antibodies against a range of brain cell receptors. She found some of these antibodies in healthy people too, but none of them had the NMDA variety.
Not all doctors agree with Lennox that we should be routinely testing for the antibodies when a patient is psychotic, at least based on what we know now. Dalmau himself has argued that just because those antibodies are there doesn't mean they necessarily cause psychosis.
Still, Lennox wonders what portion of mental illnesses, like schizophrenia, can be traced back to medical causes. And while the question isn't without controversy, doctors agree that NMDARE is more common than previously thought.
""In 2007, we have around close to 10 cases,"" Najjar recalled. ""In 2010, there was a presentation of around a hundred cases, and now we have ... thousands and thousands of cases.
""The rising incidence of (autoimmune encephalitis) is because of the rise in awareness.""
Finally, a diagnosis
After seeing Cahalan's story on TV, Gavigan's parents urged doctors to test her for it. But the doctors initially dismissed the idea.
Emily Gavigan, left, said she wouldn't have survived her autoimmune disease if journalist Susannah Cahalan hadn't told her story publicly.
""You two have to come to grips with the fact that you have a child with mental illness,"" her father recalls one doctor saying. ""You're not doing anybody any favors by grasping at these type of straws.""
But her parents' persistence paid off, and she was eventually tested.
After a lengthy series of hospital stays -- after being hooked up to a ventilator, after the seizures, after developing a blood clot in her brain following a new treatment -- the Gavigans had an answer.
""Everybody was cheering that we had a diagnosis of autoimmune encephalitis,"" Gavigan said.
Still, a long road to recovery lay ahead.
One step forward, two steps back
""Recovery is a very complicated, one-step-forward, two-steps-back process,"" said Cahalan, who could not read, write or walk when she was released from the hospital in 2009.
When the disease is identified and treated, patients typically recover, but some spend weeks or months in rehab. They may even have a relapse of the disease down the line.
The disease is treated with medications that suppress the immune system, like steroids, and treatments that counteract the harmful antibodies.
Gavigan, a passionate figure skater, had a long way to go from her wheelchair.
""It did take a long time for Emily to fully recover, but there were some milestones,"" Bill Gavigan said. ""It was probably about a year after Emily was released from the hospital that she got back on the ice.""
He shared this milestone with Cahalan, who was sitting at her desk at the New York Post when she first heard from the Gavigan family.
""I just remember clicking that video ... and just watching her twirl around that ice and just crying in the middle of the newsroom,"" Cahalan said. ""I couldn't believe that ... my story helped her find an answer, helped her find a diagnosis.""
Paying it forward
In November 2012, Cahalan made another appearance on ""Today"" -- but this time, it was with Emily and Bill Gavigan at her side. Cahalan had just published the New York Times bestseller about her illness, ""Brain on Fire.""
""If she wasn't able to tell her story, then I wouldn't have gotten a diagnosis,"" Gavigan told CNN. ""That connection, it was just surreal.""
Now, it was time for her to help fill those shoes.
Madison Jensen was diagnosed and treated for autoimmune encephalitis.
In Omaha, Nebraska, yet another family, the Jensens, eventually heard about their story. Their 6-year-old daughter, Madison, had been throwing tantrums, drooling and sometimes forgetting how to speak or read.
Mandy Jensen, Madison's mother, went back and found the ""Today"" clip online. It was just the clue they needed to get to the correct diagnosis.
Another coincidence: The episode originally aired the same day her daughter was first admitted to the hospital.
Susannah Cahalan, right, wrote about her rare autoimmune disease, leading others to a correct diagnosis -- including Madison Jensen, left, and Emily Gavigan.
Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.
""It's like divine intervention or something,"" Jensen said. ""They saved Madison's life.""
Madison Jensen, now 10 years old and an avid soccer player, hopes that telling her own story will drive other families and doctors to the correct diagnosis -- just like Cahalan did for Gavigan and they did for her.
""They helped me when they were on the 'Today' show,"" Madison said. ""Maybe we could help someone, and then ... it'd just keep going.""",fake

Mandatory Credit: Jeff Curry-USA TODAY Sports
(The Sports Xchange) - The Boston Red Sox fired manager John Farrell on Wednesday, two days after his team was eliminated from the playoffs.
Farrell, who managed the Red Sox since 2013, will not return for the 2018 season, president of baseball operations Dave Dombrowski announcement. The team said a search for a new manager will begin immediately.
Farrell, 55, was 432-378 (.533) in five seasons, leading the Red Sox to the World Series title in 2013. He was under contract through the end of the 2018 season.
The Red Sox were eliminated from the playoffs on Monday, losing to the Houston Astros 5-4 in Game 4 of the American League Division Series.
Boston finished 93-69 (.574) in 2017 to win its ninth AL East division title. The Red Sox had the third-best record in the American League, tied for fifth best in the majors.
During his Red Sox tenure, Farrell’s teams won three division titles (2013, 2016, 2017). His 432 managerial wins and 810 games managed both rank sixth in club history, and he is the only manager ever to lead the Red Sox to consecutive division titles.
Farrell’s first season in 2013 was highlighted by Boston’s eighth World Series championship.
Farrell began his major league managerial career with the Toronto Blue Jays in 2011, leading the team to a 154-170 record over two seasons. In his seven full seasons as a manager, his clubs went 586-548 (.517).
Farrell’s first professional coaching stint began with Boston in 2007 when he spent four seasons as pitching coach. Over that four-year span, the Red Sox had three postseason appearances (2007-09), including the 2007 World Series title.",fake

Advertisement Continue reading the main story
The Weinstein Company’s board said in a statement on Tuesday that it was “shocked and dismayed” by the allegations. “These alleged actions are antithetical to human decency,” the board said. One-third of the company’s all-male board had resigned on Friday.
Also on Tuesday, Georgina Chapman, Mr. Weinstein’s wife, told People magazine that she was leaving him. And the University of Southern California’s School of Cinematic Arts said it had decided to reject his earlier pledge to fund a $5 million endowment for female filmmakers.
Mr. Eisner and Jeffrey Katzenberg, who was then in charge of Disney’s movie divisions, bought Miramax in 1993 for $80 million. At the time, Miramax was becoming a superpower in the art film business by turning offbeat, inexpensive movies into mainstream hits. It was in 1992, for instance, that Miramax released the micro-budgeted thriller “The Crying Game,” which collected $62 million at the box office, or $110 million in today’s dollars.
On Tuesday, Mr. Katzenberg released an email that he sent to Mr. Weinstein on Sunday and that said he was “sickened” by the allegations. “There appear to be two Harvey Weinsteins … one that I have known well, appreciated and admired and another that I have not known at all,” Mr. Katzenberg’s email said.

Robert A. Iger, Disney’s current chief executive, said in a separate statement, “Harvey Weinstein’s reported behavior is abhorrent and unacceptable, and it has no place in our society.” Disney sold Miramax in 2010 for $660 million.
The flurry of comments came five days after a New York Times investigation chronicled a hidden history of sexual harassment allegations against Mr. Weinstein, including settlements paid, often involving former employees, over three decades. On Sunday, the Weinstein Company fired him, citing “new information about misconduct by Harvey Weinstein.”
In response to the allegations, Mr. Weinstein has acknowledged that his behavior “caused a lot of pain.” But a spokeswoman, Sallie Hofmeister, also said he “unequivocally denied” any allegations of nonconsensual sex.
Disney’s purchase of Miramax included provisions that shielded Miramax from corporate interference. The Weinsteins were given the ability to “greenlight” films with budgets of tens of millions of dollars without approval from Disney. Miramax also got to retain its own chief financial officer, head of human relations and general counsel.
According to reports at the time, the brothers demanded the autonomy, arguing that their films — which would include rough-and-rowdy titles like “Pulp Fiction,” released in 1994 — could not be incubated inside a corporate environment.
While with Disney, Miramax released more than 300 movies, which generated $5 billion in North American ticket sales and tallied at least 220 Academy Award nominations and 53 wins, including best picture Oscars for “Shakespeare in Love,” “The English Patient” and “Chicago.”

But Disney also clashed bitterly with the Weinsteins, who took advantage of their autonomy to start an expensive magazine, Talk, without approval and to move forward with the political documentary “Fahrenheit 9/11” despite being told that Disney would not distribute it. At the time, executives at Disney said Miramax had hidden its financing of that film by not including it on monthly reports about films in development; Miramax officials countered that they were aboveboard.",fake

557,Week 4 Prediction Article - Oakland Raiders @ Denver Broncos,"Week 4 Prediction Article – Oakland Raiders @ Denver Broncos
(Before It's News)
Good morning Bronco fans! It is week 4 in the NFL as we are back at home against our division rivals, the Oakland Raiders. Both teams come into this contest with a record of 2-1 after losing in week 3. Both teams will look to rebound and continue to chase the division leading, 3-0 Kansas City Chiefs.
Oakland is coming off of a 27-10 loss to the Redskins and Denver is coming off of a 26-16 loss to the Buffalo Bills. Last week against the Redskins, the Oakland Raiders couldn’t muster up any offensive momentum as the Redskins dominated them throughout the whole game. QB Derek Carr was just 19 of 31 passing with 118 yards. Oakland will also be without the services of WR Michael Crabtree who is inactive today due to an injury. RB Marshawn “Beast Mode” Lynch will look to rebound after a poor start last week, in which he had just 6 carries for 18 yards.
Denver will look to avoid making costly mistakes on offense, as Trevor Siemian knows he must protect the “billion dollar” football. Turnovers have been a huge momentum killer for the Broncos this season as Siemian has now thrown 4 interceptions on the season. Denver certainly has the offensive weapons to give opposing teams nightmares with arguably one of the best WR duos in the league. Demaryius Thomas and Emmanuel Sanders have combined for 33 receptions, 399 yards and 2 touchdowns, while WR Bennie Fowler is also making his presence known with 8 catches for 84 yards and 2 touchdowns of his own.
The Denver defense is ranked #1 in the NFL against the rush, allowing just under 60 yards per game. Their defense is also ranked 4th overall, allowing 263 yards per game. Washington showed the world how to manhandle and beat the Raiders, so the Broncos will just need to follow suit.
5 Keys to Victory
Get pressure on Derek Carr. Last week, Carr was sacked 4 times and pressured all day long. With the Denver secondary locking down receivers and the ferocious pass rush of the Broncos, getting into Carr’s head early will be a huge factor in this game.
Continue to run the football. With RBs C.J. Anderson and Jamal Charles, the Broncos have a formidable two-headed rushing attack. Anderson is averaging 4.4 yards per carry as Charles is averaging 5.1 yards per carry. Establish the run early and continue to pound the ball. Rush for over 100 yards, and I can see a Denver victory.
Keep Siemian upright. Oakland boasts one of the best pass rushers in the NFL with Khalil Mack. Mack has the ability to single handily disrupt the flow of a game and make huge, game changing plays. Protect the QB.
Again, win the turnover battle. Siemian must protect the football. This includes interceptions and strip sacks. Always know where Khalil Mack is and make smart throws, not throws across your body that goes to the other team.
Do not allow Marshawn Lynch to go into beast mode. Denver is going to have to attack the ball carrier, hold on tight and gang tackle. Lynch will run through arm tackles and make defenses pay dearly.

Oakland Raiders – 13
Denver Broncos – 20

248,Financialization and The Destruction of the Real Economy,"[gard align='center']
By Charles Hugh Smith
Strip an economy of capital, productive incentives, talent and yes, ethics, and what are we left with? An economy spiraling toward an inevitable collapse.
Financialization is destroying the real economy, but few in power seem to notice or care. The reason why is painfully obvious: those in power are reaping vast fortunes from the engines of financialization–for example, former President Obama: Obama Goes From White House to Wall Street in Less Than One Year.
This is not to single out President Obama as a special case; politicos across the spectrum depend on the engines of financialization to fund their campaigns and make them multi-millionaires, and corporate managers and financiers have skimmed billions of dollars in gains not from producing new, better and more affordable goods and services but by playing financialization games such as borrowing billions to buy back stocks, leveraged buyouts, and so on–all of which have reaped the insiders gargantuan fortunes while hollowing out the real economy.
Financialization necessarily hollows out the real economy, as Gordon Long and I detail in this new video program: The Results of Financialization – Part I (34 minutes)
The key dynamic is that financialization creates irresistible incentives to ramp up debt and leverage at the expense of the real economy. Those who fail to exploit financialization will underperform the market and be fired.
As Gordon explains, if a CEO refuses to load a company up with debt, a private-equity financier with access to cheap Federal Reserve credit will scoop up the company in a private buyout, fire the management, extract immense profits by loading the company with debt, then take the hollowed-out shell public again, reaping another windfall of financialized gains.
Note that the private-equity financiers have every incentive to lay off employees, especially experienced workers who earn higher salaries, to reduce costs before they take the hollowed-out shell public. How can corporations pay out more to shareholders than they actually earned? Easy–financialization. Another key dynamic in financialization is limitless liquidity and super low interest rates set by central banks–rates that are so low and liquidity so abundant that corporations can roll over their debt and actually add more debt and keep their interest payments unchanged.
This dynamic inevitably leads to zombie corporations–corporations with low rates of growth and profitability and high debt loads that in an unfinancialized economy would be recognized as insolvent and liquidated.
As we explain, financialization skews the risk-reward in favor of financial games, so real-world investments no longer make sense. Why risk building a factory in the U.S. or training workers when the pay-off is uncertain, when there are so many ways to reap immense fortunes via financial games that are ultimately backstopped by the Federal Reserve or federal agencies (i.e. the taxpayers)?
As many observers have noted, these perverse incentives have siphoned human talent away from productive employment and into enormously well-compensated but parasitic, exploitative financialization-related jobs.
Strip an economy of capital, productive incentives, talent and yes, ethics, and what are we left with? An economy spiraling toward an inevitable collapse. The metaphor I’ve used to explain this in the past is the Yellowstone forest fire. The deadwood of bad debt, extreme leverage, zombie companies and all the other fallen branches of financialization pile up, but the central banks no longer allow any creative destruction of unpayable debt and mis-allocated capital; every brush fire is instantly suppressed with more stimulus, more liquidity and lower interest rates.
As a result, the deadwood sapping the real economy of productivity and innovation is allowed to pile higher.
The only possible output of this suppression is an economy piled high with explosive risk. Eventually Nature supplies a lightning strike, and the resulting conflagration consumes the entire economy.
I explain all this in greater detail in my short book Why Our Status Quo Failed and Is Beyond Reform.

((This version of the story corrects to remove name of Kaspersky spokesperson cited by Washington Post in 15th paragraph. The story quoted a company statement).)
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Israeli intelligence officials spying on Russian government hackers found they were using Kaspersky Lab antivirus software that is also used by 400 million people globally, including U.S. government agencies, according to media reports on Tuesday.
The Israeli officials who had hacked into Kaspersky’s network over two years ago then warned their U.S. counterparts of the Russian intrusion, said the New York Times, which first reported the story. (nyti.ms/2yev8Vj)
That led to a decision in Washington only last month to order Kaspersky software removed from government computers.
The Washington Post also reported on Tuesday that the Israeli spies had also found in Kaspersky's network hacking tools that could only have come from the U.S. National Security Agency. wapo.st/2i2clXa
Related Coverage Germany: 'No evidence' Kaspersky software used by Russians for hacks
After an investigation, the NSA found that those tools were in possession of the Russian government, the Post said.
And late last month, the U.S. National Intelligence Council completed a classified report that it shared with NATO allies concluding that Russia’s FSB intelligence service had “probable access” to Kaspersky customer databases and source code, the Post reported.
That access, it concluded, could help enable cyber attacks against U.S. government, commercial and industrial control networks, the Post reported.
The New York Times said the Russian operation, according to multiple people briefed on the matter, is known to have stolen classified documents from a National Security Agency employee who had improperly stored them on his home computer, which had Kaspersky antivirus software installed on it.
It is not yet publicly known what other U.S. secrets the Russian hackers may have discovered by turning the Kaspersky software into a sort of Google search for sensitive information, the Times said.
The current and former government officials who described the episode spoke about it on condition of anonymity because of classification rules, the Times said.
The newspaper said the National Security Agency and the White House declined to comment, as did the Israeli Embassy, while the Russian Embassy did not respond to requests for comment.
The Russian embassy in Washington last month called the ban on Kaspersky Lab software “regrettable” and said it delayed the prospects of restoring bilateral ties.
Kaspersky Lab denied to the Times any knowledge of, or involvement in, the Russian hacking. “Kaspersky Lab has never helped, nor will help, any government in the world with its cyberespionage efforts,” the company said in a statement on Tuesday.
Eugene Kaspersky, the company’s co-founder and chief executive, has repeatedly denied charges his company conducts espionage on behalf of the Russian government.
The company issued a statement saying that “as a private company, Kaspersky Lab does not have inappropriate ties to any government, including Russia, and the only conclusion seems to be that Kaspersky Lab is caught in the middle of a geopolitical fight,” the Washington Post reported. The company “does not possess any knowledge” of Israel’s hack, the Post cited the statement as saying.

Storm Nate has weakened to a tropical depression after bringing strong winds, heavy rain and some flooding to the south-eastern United States.
It made landfall as a hurricane twice, in Louisiana and Mississippi, and is currently over Alabama.
Storm surge warnings have been lifted across the region.
Nate killed at least 25 people in Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Honduras. No deaths or injuries have yet been reported in the US.
Although it was not as strong as last month's Maria and Irma, the states of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and parts of Florida had issued warnings and evacuation orders ahead of its arrival.
'Minimal' damage
Film footage from Biloxi, Mississippi, where the storm made landfall, showed flooded streets and highways.

But the waters quickly receded, leaving boats and vehicles marooned.
Mayor of nearby Gulfport, Billy Hewes, told the BBC the storm surge did not appear to be as high as feared and he thought the damage there would ""be minimal"".

Mississippi emergency official Greg Flynn told AP that more than 1,000 people in the state spent the night in shelters but no major damage had been reported.
In southern Alabama, the local power company said some 5,000 people were without power. Residents there had been urged to take precautions ahead of Nate's arrival.
A mandatory curfew was lifted in New Orleans, Louisiana, as the threat to the city - devastated by Hurricane Katrina in 2005 - was downgraded.
Nate was downgraded from a hurricane to a tropical storm by the National Hurricane Center at 09:00 GMT on Sunday, and later to a tropical depression.
Warnings of storm surge flooding were lifted on Sunday afternoon.

Five ports along the Gulf Coast were also closed to shipping as a precaution ahead of Nate's arrival. Most oil and gas platforms in the US Gulf of Mexico also evacuated their staff, but are now planning to reopen.
US President Donald Trump on Saturday issued an emergency declaration for Louisiana and Mississippi, allowing the state to seek federal help with preparation and possible relief efforts.
Nate's deadly impact in Central America

3819,Britain could join NAFTA if Brexit trade deal fails: Telegraph newspaper,"A pro-EU demonstrator walks past a woman reading a book on the seafront during the Labour party Conference in Brighton, Britain, September 24, 2017. REUTERS/Toby Melville
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain could join a formal trade alliance with the United States, Canada and Mexico if the European Union refuses to clinch a post-Brexit trade deal, the Daily Telegraph newspaper reported on Tuesday.
The newspaper said British ministers were looking at joining the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) as part of planning for the possibility of Britain leaving the EU in March 2019 without a trade deal. It gave no sources for the report.
“As we prepare to leave the EU, we will seek to transition all existing EU trade arrangements to ensure that the UK maintains the greatest amount of certainty, continuity and stability in our trade and investment relationships,” a spokesman for the Department for International Trade said.
When asked for comment on The Telegraph report, the spokesman said: “We are confident that we will find a deal that works for Britain and Europe too. But it is our responsibility as a government to prepare for every eventuality, and that is what we are doing.”
Britain is currently negotiating the terms of its divorce from the EU though Prime Minister Theresa May is pushing to move onto discussions about a major free trade deal with the world’s biggest trading bloc.
With the clock ticking down toward Brexit day in 2019, British ministers are exploring the options if the world’s fifth largest economy drops out of the EU without a clear trade deal.
Besides aiming to clinch a U.S. trade deal or forming some new trade grouping, some British supporters of Brexit have pondered joining an existing trade alliance such as NAFTA.
But U.S. President Donald Trump has warned he may terminate the 1994 NAFTA deal because he says it does not serve U.S. economic interests.
If Britain did join NAFTA, manufacturers wanting to export to the EU and North America would have to produce goods in accordance with the two separate sets of rules, according to trade analysts.
Britain, whose regulation has been within the EU’s orbit for over 40 years, would also have to shift toward the North American model for services, goods, competition policy and data protection.
The EU is Britain’s biggest single export market, accounting for about 50 percent of goods exports in August. The United States was the single biggest destination for British exports, accounting for 14 percent in August.",fake
1893,"Another Appeals Court Rules Warrants Required for ""Stingray"" Cellphone Surveillance","By Derrick Broze
An appeals court in Washington has ruled that law enforcement must acquire a search warrant before employing cell phone surveillance tools often known as “Stingrays.”
On September 21, an appeals court in Washington issued a damning ruling regarding law enforcement use of cell phone surveillance tools without the use of a warrant. The appeals court became the fourth court to rule against the unrestricted use of the controversial cell site simulators, sometimes known as “Stingrays.” The issue could eventually make its way to the Supreme Court. Stingray is the brand name of a popular cell-site simulator manufactured by the Harris Corporation.
The Electronic Frontier Foundation describes Stingrays as “a brand name of an IMSI (International Mobile Subscriber Identity) Catcher targeted and sold to law enforcement. A Stingray works by masquerading as a cell phone tower – to which your mobile phone sends signals to every 7 to 15 seconds whether you are on a call or not – and tricks your phone into connecting to it.”
This allows the officer who is in possession of the Stingray to know who, when, and to where you are calling, the precise location of every device within the range, and with the latest models, capture the content of your conversations. As the use of Stingrays has grown quickly in the last five years, the public has largely remained in the dark as investigative journalists work to expose the technology.
The case involves Prince Jones, a man sentenced to 66 years in prison after he convicted of sexually assaulting two women. During Jones’ trial it was revealed that D.C. police used a Stingray to locate Jones. The police used the device without first obtaining a warrant. Mr. Jones’ attorney unsuccessfully attempted to have the evidence suppressed at his original trial due to this warrantless tracking. However, the appeals court ruling means the evidence cannot be used and the conviction is overturned.
“The simulator’s operation involved exploitation of a security flaw in a device that most people now feel obligated to carry with them at all times,” wrote Judge Corinne Beckwith in the majority opinion for the court.
Allowing the government to deploy such a powerful tool without judicial oversight would surely ‘shrink the realm of guaranteed privacy’ far below that which ‘existed when the Fourth Amendment was adopted.’
In addition, Judge Beckwith wrote that the use of Stingrays “place an individual in the difficult position either of accepting the risk that at any moment his or her cellphone could be converted into tracking device or of forgoing ‘necessary use of’ the cell phone”.
Prosecutors attempted to convince the judges that it is common knowledge that cellphone can be tracked and thus no expectation of privacy exists. Beckwith disagreed, stating that “a person does not lose a reasonable expectation of privacy merely because he or she is made aware of the government’s capacity to invade his or her privacy.”
The 2 to 1 ruling from the D.C. Court of Appeals comes after similar rulings in the Maryland Court of Special Appeals and federal district courts in New York City and San Francisco.
Nathan F. Wessler of the American Civil Liberties Union, told the Washington Post that the ruling “joins the growing chorus of courts holding that the Fourth Amendment protects against warrantless use of invasive, covert technology to track people’s phones. … We applaud today’s opinion for erecting sensible and strong protections against the government violating people’s privacy in the digital age.”
The growing use of Stingrays and the consistent secrecy of federal and local law enforcement agencies has lead to at least one other instance of a federal judge throwing out evidence which was gained using a stingray. In July 2016, a federal judge in Maryland rejected evidence because police did not obtain a warrant before using the device. Still, there is no consistent policy on how police should handle new technology like the Stingray.
In 2015, the Department of Justice issued a policy guidance ordering its agencies to obtain a search warrant before using the cell site simulators. This guidance does not apply to local and state police. With four federal and state courts now ruling that law enforcement must obtain a warrant before use of Stingrays, it is likely one of these rulings will be challenged in the Supreme Court. Until then, local and state law enforcement are operating in as much secrecy as possible.
It is only through the work of investigative journalists and whistleblowers that the public understands the depth of these devices. The situation has even garnered the attention of the U.S. House and Oversight Committee. In late 2016, the committee issued a report titled, “Law Enforcement Use of Cell-Site Simulation Technologies: Privacy Concerns and Recommendations.” The report notes that the U.S. Department of Justice has 310 cell site simulators spread across several agencies, including the FBI and U.S. Marshals Service. The DOJ spent more than $71 million cell site simulator technology and upgrades between 2010 and 2014. According to the report The Department of Homeland Security has 124 cell-site simulators.
The committee also called on state and local officials to adopt policies similar to those recently enacted by the Department of Justice. In addition, the committee recommend that law enforcement be more forthcoming with judges when they request approval for the use of the devices. As of September 2017, none of these recommendations have been implemented.

2889,Timol inquest: Verdict gives hope to apartheid victims,"Image copyright AFP Image caption Ahmed Timol's nephew, Imtiaz Cajee, testified to the pain of losing his uncle
The inquest into the 1971 death of anti-apartheid activist Ahmed Timol has found that he was murdered, shattering a five-decade-long claim by security police that he had committed suicide.
In a packed courtroom, Judge Billy Mothle ruled that he ""was pushed"" out of the window of the 10th floor building where he had been detained by the apartheid police.
Applause rang out in court at the end of his ruling - vindication for the Timol family at last.
But what is the significant of the ruling for South Africa and other families who have lost loved ones in a similar way?
""After this ruling we are hoping to see large scale investigations,"" says Lawson Naidoo, head of the Council for the Advancement of the South African Constitution.
Many of those who were with Mr Timol at the time have since died but the judge found that they were ""complicit"" in his death and recommended that prosecutions should follow because perjury had been committed by some former state security members who testified at this hearing.
And so for the first time in the history of its atrocities, it seemed as though the apartheid system of white minority rule was on trial in South Africa.
Reliving the past
The inquiry offered a rare glimpse into the gruesome workings of the racist regime - and demanded answers.
For those brief few weeks it was as though Mr Timol was speaking for himself - and on behalf of those who died like him.
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption What was apartheid? A 90-second look back at decades of injustice
Officially, police records say he leapt to his death from the infamous John Vorster Square, now called Johannesburg Central police station.
Mr Timol's family had for years campaigned for a new investigation, saying he was not ""one to give up"" - that he would have never taken his own life.
Many other families here have for decades struggled to make peace with the deaths of their loved ones - largely due to the secrecy around it.
Activists say that between 1963 and 1990, at least 73 anti-apartheid fighters people died in police detention, in some situation their deaths bore an uncanny resemblance to that of Mr Timol.
Still no-one was ever called to account - the murderers were faceless, protected by the state even after the advent of democracy in 1994.
For the Mabelane family, this case has inspired hope. Matthews, then aged 23, was said to have jumped to his death, like Mr Timol.
Image copyright AFP Image caption Lasch Mabelane and his father 95-year-old Phillip hope more investigations will follow
His older brother Lasch Mabelane tells me the family has for decades been haunted by not knowing what really happened to Matthews.
""The day before he died, the police came to my parents' home and told them they need to make an appointment if they want to see him. They said: 'Do you know you have a naughty child?' and said they would discipline him,"" he says.
""Many people like my brother supposedly jumped from the 10th floor, it's the same story - the same floor,"" he adds.
Other activists who died at John Vorster Square police station:
Wellington Tshazibane: Found hanging in his cell on 11 December 1976
Neil Aggett: Found hanging in his cell on 5 February 1982
Ernest Dipale: Found hanging in his cell three days after his second detention, died 5 August 1982
Stanza Bopape: Died of a heart attack after being subject to repeated electric shocks, on 5 June 1988
Clayton Sithole: Found hanging dead in his cell on 30 January 1990
""We've never believed that he killed himself, he loved life and loved his family. The pain of losing him changed all of us, especially my parents.""
His father, Phillip Mabelane is 95 years old and a widower - he believes his wife died of a broken heart.
""Our child died in a painful way. We were left with so many questions and couldn't even ask them. This trouble my wife until the end,"" he says.
""The apartheid police were known to be violent, you didn't ask questions, you just accepted what you were told. How can you ever find peace in a situation like that?"" he asks.
Taking secrets to the grave
Peace and stability in this country were paid for in blood and an unspoken vow by those who worked for the state to take secrets to the grave.
This country's vast landscape is dotted with the unmarked graves of apartheid activists. Dinner table conversations frequently drift into stories of exiles who disappeared without a trace - leaving behind a trail of unanswered questions.
Image copyright AFP Image caption John Vorster Square, now known as the Johannesburg Central Police Station was the sight of several assaults and deaths
The Timol inquest could forever change that legacy.
This was the first inquest in democratic South Africa to specifically look into apartheid deaths in police custody.
While an investigation into Mr Timol's death was conducted at the time, many had believed it was a cover-up for the abuses that were happening at the height of white minority rule.
The long-awaited proceedings took weeks to conclude but had many glued to TV screens as high-ranking security police officers, men who until now had lived in the shadows, testified about the torture of activists at the height of the fight for freedom here.
Their actions included severe beatings, electrocution and at times crushing testicles.
In August fresh eyes began looking at the evidence led in court.
Some of the expert witnesses testified that some of Mr Timol's injuries, his cracked skull, were not consistent with the conclusion the apartheid police had reached at the initial inquest back in 1971.
Files with evidence of his bludgeoned body told tales of assault, witnesses testified to seeing Mr Timol days before his death being escorted by the police in the corridors of the police station and that he could barely walk.
These records are some of what led to Judge Mothle's historic findings.
Image copyright AFP Image caption Many protests have been staged calling for an investigation into Steve Biko's death
Mr Timol isn't the only activist to die under suspicious circumstances - Steve Biko also died while in police detention, supposedly because he had been on a hunger strike. No explanation was ever given for the bruises on his body.
In the minds of many, Mr Biko was murdered.
Nkosinathi Biko, through the Steve Biko Foundation, says their research puts the deaths of high-profile detainees, including his father, at 160.
""Many of them have as a cause of death, suicide or slipped on a bar of soap, that sort of thing. So uncovering the truth is important not only for those families but for the country. It should be a national record,"" he told the BBC.
There have been attempts at unearthing the truth in democratic South Africa such as the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC).
However, in recent years the TRC's failure to compel apartheid loyalists who testified at the commission to ""tell all"" has come in for increasing criticism, along with granting perpetrators amnesty for their testimony.
While the hearings were hailed as a necessary process to help move the country into a peaceful democracy, many said it denied justice to victims of apartheid.
In the minds of many, justice will only come if those behind the murders and torture are prosecuted and punished for their crimes.
""You cannot forgive what you do not know, what was never acknowledged. The people who killed our children must be made to tell the truth and face the consequences of their actions,"" says Mr Mabelane Snr.",fake

90,The online bots behind Vladimir Putin's birthday wishes,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Russian President Vladimir Putin pictured on holiday in Siberia in August
When President Vladimir Putin turned 65 on 7 October, he was not short of online well-wishers. But how many were real?
A hashtag which translates as ""Happy Birthday President"" began trending in early that day in Russia.
One of the most popular tweets using this tag is:
Image copyright @vitischeg / Twitter Image caption The hashtag translates as ""Happy Birthday President"", and the caption on the photo of the bear says ""Vladimir Vladimirovich (Putin), High five! Happy B-day!""
While the tweet was shared more than 800 times, none of those sharing it appear to be Russian speakers. They also seemed to lack the personality of an individual, were often advertising services, and with account information containing frequent typos.
""We are a professional photo servic in Vicoria an on Vancouver Island"" (sic) said one. Another described themselves as a ""Maria Arts Mrketing Guru"" (also sic).
Several also contained sexually explicit content.
Who is @vitischeg?
The @vitischeg profile also raises suspicions. The account was created in 2014 yet all tweets posted prior to 20 September appear to have been deleted. An analysis of the timeline suggests the account has stayed inactive for months at a time.
The bio states that the account holder is named Viktor Petrov-Vodkin - who shares his surname with a prominent Soviet painter. But an analysis by BBC Monitoring, using the social media tool Crimson Hexagon, shows the account previously used the name Viktor Vodkin-Petrov.
While the name Viktor, and the profile picture of a bearded man wearing shades, indicate that the owner of the account is masculine, a now-deleted tweet from 16 September uses the feminine form of a verb to describe how the account owner tried to make a salad.
This is not the first time @vitischeg has wished Vladimir Putin happy birthday. In 2016, the account tweeted the same meme of the bear but with the hashtag #PutinDay. That trending tag, as well as @vitischeg's tweets was reported on by two Kremlin-funded outlets, RT and Sputnik.

Random letters and numbers
On Putin's birthday this year, another account which shared the presidential well-wishing hashtag also raised suspicions.
This time, while almost all of the re-tweeters of the message by @YuryKuznetsov65 appeared to speak Russian, they still exhibited signs of being bots. Many of them had generic profile pictures of a logo, a landscape or a film character.
Similarly the names of many of these accounts are a random combination of numbers and letters (e.g. @NK598489, @8202ed2f4f1441a, @gda070874, or @V13155800). These are classic tell-tale signs of potential Twitter bots.
The @YuryKuznetsov65 account, was less than a day old at the time of tweeting. It claims, however, to be a replacement for @comradzampolit, a well-established pro-Kremlin account suspended by Twitter earlier this year.
Image copyright @YuryKuznetsov65 / Twitter Image caption Translation: ""Greetings comrades! I've set up what I hope will be a temporary account while I'm banned. My private messages are open, happy to answer any questions. Proof that this account is genuine is via this website. Max re-tweet!""
'Personality Cult'
Ben Nimmo, an information defence senior fellow at the Atlantic Council who studies online misinformation, says the happy birthday campaign is likely a privately run effort rather than a Kremlin-sponsored initiative.
""Bots are always hard to attribute, because they hide behind the anonymity Twitter allows, so it's not clear who's behind this,"" Nimmo told BBC Trending.
""This looks like a botnet [collection of automated bot accounts] at work, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's government-linked. The first network, in particular, looks commercial - for example, with lots of bitcoin adverts. The networks are small, in the hundreds of retweets, whereas major bot operations can involve tens of thousands of accounts. So this could simply come from a Putin fan with time and bots on his hands.
""There have been elements of a personality cult around Putin since early in his first term. Russia is due for presidential elections next year. Putin is expected to run for a fourth term, but his last re-election, in 2012, was marked by significant protests against him, and against election fraud. All the indications are that the Kremlin is desperate to avoid a repeat.
""We can't rule out some official connection here, but it looks more likely that this is a private pro-Putin initiative.""

2057,256 Years Old Man Breaks The Silence Before His Death And Reveals SHOCKING Secrets To The World,"What is the longest a person has ever lived for? Meet Li Ching Yuen, a man who lived an astonishing 256 years! And no, this is not a myth or a fictional tale.
 
According to a 1930 New York Times article, Wu Chung-chieh, a professor of the Chengdu University, discovered Imperial Chinese government records from 1827 congratulating Li Ching-Yuen on his 150th birthday, and further documents later congratulating him on his 200th birthday in 1877. In 1928, a New York Times correspondent wrote that many of the old men in Li’s neighborhood asserted that their grandfathers knew him when they were boys, and that he at that time was a grown man.
 
Li Ching Yuen reportedly began his herbalist career at the age of 10, where he gathered herbs in mountain ranges and learned of their potency for longevity. For almost 40 years, he survived on a diet of herbs such as lingzhi, goji berry, wild ginseng, he shoo wu and gotu kola and rice wine. In 1749, at the age of 71, he joined the Chinese armies as teacher of martial arts. Li was said to be a much-loved figure in his community, marrying 23 times and fathering over 200 children.
 
 
According to the generally accepted tales told in his province, Li was able to read and write as a child, and by his tenth birthday had traveled in Kansu, Shansi, Tibet, Annam, Siam and Manchuria gathering herbs. For the first hundred years he continued at this occupation. Then he switched to selling herbs gathered by others. He sold lingzhi, goji berry, wild ginseng, he shou wu and gotu kola along with other Chinese herbs, and lived off a diet of these herbs and rice wine.
 
He Wasn’t The Only One
 
According to one of Li’s disciples, he had once encountered an even older 500-year-old man, who taught him Qigong exercises and dietary recommendations that would help him extend his lifespan to superhuman proportions. Apart from Qigong and a herb-rich diet, what else can we learn from this Master of Longevity?
 
How about this: On his death bed, Li famously said, “I have done all that I have to do in this world”. Could his peaceful last words also hint at one of the biggest secrets to a long and prosperous life? It’s interesting to note that in the West, we’re often taught to believe that aging is something that must be “beaten” with high tech infrared devices and state of the art medication.
 
His Secret To Long Health:
 
Li was asked what his secret was to longevity. This was his reply: “Keep a quiet heart, sit like a tortoise, walk sprightly like a pigeon and sleep like a dog.” These were the words of advice Li gave to Wu Pei-fu, the warlord, who took Li into his house to learn the secret of extremely long life.
 
Li maintained that inward calm and peace of mind combined with breathing techniques were the secrets to incredible longevity. Obviously, his diet would have played a large role. But its fascinating that the old living person in recorded history attributes his long life to his state of mind.
 
Why Is This So Hard To Believe?
 
With the average lifespan for the Western world currently sitting between 70-85 years, the thought of someone living over 100 years old seems like quite the stretch. The thought of someone living over 200 years old seems extremely suspicious. But why don’t we believe that people can live this long?
 
We have to keep in mind that some people in this world don’t live a grueling 9-5 lifestyle, they don’t have to deal with the stresses of debt, they aren’t breathing polluted city air, and they exercise regularly. They don’t eat refined sugars or flour, or any foods that have had pesticides sprayed on them. They aren’t living off of the standard American diet.
 
They aren’t eating fatty meats, sugary deserts, and genetically modified foods. No antibiotics. No alcohol and no tobacco. Their diets not only exclude junk foods that we so often indulge in, they also include superfoods and herbs which are like steroids for our organs and immune system.
 
They also spend their spare time in nature practicing breathing techniques and meditating which have been proven to improve mental, physical, and emotional health. They keep things simple, get proper sleep, and spend a great deal of time in nature under the sun. When we get a chance to relax in the sun, we feel instantly rejuvenated and call this a “vacation”. Imagine spending a lifetime doing that in the mountains, and combining that with perfect mental, spiritual, and physical well-being.
 
I do not doubt for a minute that if we all did the things we knew we were supposed to do, that living to be 100 years old would be commonplace. When we treat our bodies right, who knows how long we can live for?

279,Japanese GP: Lewis Hamilton position 'not comfortable at all',"They get into Formula 1 early in Japan: Lewis Hamilton high-fives a young fan while signing autographs at Suzuka
Lewis Hamilton says he is ""not comfortable at all"" with his position in the championship despite a sizeable lead over rival Sebastian Vettel.
The Mercedes driver is 34 points ahead of Vettel heading into Sunday's Japanese Grand Prix with 125 available in the remaining five races this year.
Hamilton said: ""I am under no illusion. I might have the nail a little bit in, but I need to keep hammering it.
""It is not done until there is no more to push it in.""
Hamilton has gained 31 points on Vettel in the past two races after problems for the German and his Ferrari team.
""There are so many points available and you have seen other years where things swing,"" Hamilton added.
""The pendulum can swing. I am hoping if it starts to swing the other way we have enough force to push it back to where it should be.""
Ferrari have been quicker than Mercedes in the past two races but both their cars crashed out together at the first corner in Singapore and Vettel finished fourth in Malaysia after starting from the back because of an engine problem.
Asked to rate his chances of overhauling Hamilton, Vettel said: ""We have a chance. I tend not to rate many things. I think there is a chance and we make sure we use it.

'If the car was perfect every weekend, it would be boring'
Mercedes had a difficult weekend in Malaysia, where they expected to be more competitive than they were.
Hamilton said Mercedes had ""definitely still question marks"" about the car's performance but added: ""I saw some stories that we had been thrown off the ball or are on the back foot. We're not.
""We are still leading the championship, we still have a great car. Each race is really just about trying to understand more about the car because there is constantly something new coming in the mix that can catch us off guard.
""That is the exciting thing about this car. If the car was perfect every weekend, it would be boring and we are enjoying the fact we are being challenged and that she is not the easiest.
""I don't know if any of you guys can predict but I definitely can't predict what races are going to work and what are not. We thought we'd be stronger in the last race but we were way off but we still got pole and finished second.""

582,India: What happened to Modi's promise of an economic boom?,"India's economy, once hailed as a global bright spot, is down in the dumps.
Growth in the South Asian nation fell during the first six months of 2017 from 7% to 5.7%, its slowest pace in three years, and analysts say the road to recovery is steep.
""We're on a downward spiral,"" said Mohan Guruswamy, head of the Center for Policy Alternatives in Delhi, and a former official at India's finance ministry.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi swept into power in 2014, promising to take India's economy to new heights. But many reforms have yet to materialize and some changes that have been enacted are hurting growth.
Modi defended his performance in a speech Wednesday, claiming his government had helped several industries.
""It is true that there has been a reduction in growth, but it is also true that the government is fully committed to reversing this trend,"" he said. ""Our fundamentals are strong.""
A double whammy
India is still reeling from two shocks within 12 months -- Modi's sudden ban last November of 86% of the country's cash, and a sweeping overhaul of the tax system aimed at turning the country's 29 states into a single market.
The cash ban ""was a massive blow, just when the economy looked at a point of inflection last year and the decline had started leveling off,"" Guruswamy said.
Modi's signature reform -- a national goods and services tax implemented in July -- has been widely hailed as a positive step because it should simplify business in the long run. But the implementation caused major disruption.
""My fear was that if people didn't understand how to do the tax system, then they would stop doing business with one another,"" said Shailesh Kumar, South Asia analyst at the Eurasia Group. ""You did see some of that...as companies didn't really know what to do.""
The government has said it expected a growth slowdown, but appears to have been blindsided by the sharp drop.
Top financial institutions are worried that the economy will struggle to regain its momentum in the near term. The central bank has just slashed its growth forecast for the current fiscal year to 6.7% from 7.3%.
""The implementation of the [tax reform] appears to have rendered short-term prospects uncertain,"" Reserve Bank of India Governor Urjit Patel told reporters.
The State Bank of India, which is owned by the government, was more blunt. The slowdown, it said in a report last month, is ""not short term in nature or even transient.""
Modi's not delivering
Analysts, business leaders and even members of Modi's own party are now questioning his stewardship of the economy, not just because of the upheaval his changes have caused but also over reforms that aren't happening.
""High on the list of priorities is pushing through measures to ease land acquisition laws and liberalize the labor market,"" analysts at Capital Economics wrote in a recent note. ""But there is no clear indication yet that Prime Minister Modi actually has the conviction to push ahead with necessary but unpopular reforms.""
There have also been calls for an overhaul of the banking system. About 12% of total loans have gone bad, according to official data.
Yashwant Sinha, a former finance minister and senior member of Modi's party, wrote an opinion article slamming the ""mess"" that the Indian economy is in. ""A hard landing appears inevitable,"" Sinha said.
Beef and beer bans
Rising Hindu nationalism, stoked by Modi's right-wing party, is also hurting some parts of the economy.
In May, the government banned the sale of cows -- an animal considered sacred by the country's Hindu majority -- for slaughter, sending the meat industry into a frenzy.
While the ban was suspended by India's Supreme Court in July, the policy confusion has had a chilling effect. India exports vast quantities of buffalo meat. Those exports have declined this year, according to local media.
Cattle that once provided a vital source of additional income for millions of India's rural poor have now become liabilities because farmers fear they will be unable to sell them to the meat and leather industry, Guruswamy said.
Hindu nationalists have ""completely unleashed a reign of terror as far as cattle are concerned,"" he added.
India's Supreme Court dealt the economy another blow in April, banning the sale of alcohol within 500 meters (546 yards) of national highways. Some estimates put the hospitality industry's potential losses at $10 billion.
The court eased the restrictions in August, but many within the industry said they had already lost millions. Diageo (DEO), the company behind brands like Johnnie Walker and Smirnoff, said the India ban would dent sales growth.
Some of India's top trading partners are taking note.
""The space for civil society in India continues to shrink as Hindu nationalism rises,"" Sen. Bob Corker, chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, said on Tuesday.
Corker, who was speaking during a hearing to nominate a new U.S. ambassador to India, also expressed disappointment at the state of the economy.
""In particular, I remain frustrated by the slow pace of Indian reforms in the economic sphere,"" he said.
Millions of new jobs needed
Modi faces an uphill struggle to steady the ship. The most pressing challenge, experts say, is to create the jobs he promised India's large young population.
Around 12 million Indians enter the workforce every year, but struggle to find employment.
""Poor quality data makes it difficult to put a number on the job woes, but the available data is grim and news stories about jobs losses abound,"" Ruchir Sharma, chief global strategist at Morgan Stanley, wrote in the Times of India newspaper on Wednesday.
Over 1.5 million Indians lost their jobs in the first half of 2017, according to a study by the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy, and unemployment is on the rise.",fake

2846,"Fecal bacteria found in drinks at McDonald’s, Burger King and KFC","Traces of fecal bacteria have been found in drinks at three of the world’s biggest fast-food chains in the United Kingdom.
 
An investigation has found that McDonald’s, Burger King and KFC served ice in drinks contaminated by fecal matter. Investigators from the BBC consumer show “Watchdog” tested 10 samples at each of the chains and tested for traces of “fecal coliform,” which carry a number of diseases.
 
Coliforms were found in three samples of McDonald’s drinks, six of Burger King’s and in seven samples taken at KFC sites. Four of the samples taken at Burger King and five at KFC were described as having “significant” levels.
 
In a response, reported widely by media, a KFC spokesman said: “We are shocked and extremely disappointed by these results.”
 
“We have strict procedures for the management and handling of ice, including daily and weekly inspections and cleaning of the ice machine and storage holds, as well as the routine testing of ice quality across our business.”
 
 
Burger King’s response has also been widely circulated by media outlets: “Cleanliness and hygiene are a top priority for the Burger King brand.”
 
“The strict procedures we have in place are designed to ensure all Guests have a positive experience each time they visit our restaurants,” the Burger chain added.
 
Neither KFC or Burger King were immediately available for a response when contacted by CNBC.
 
A McDonald’s spokesman told CNBC: “We have robust procedures in place with regard to the production, storage and handling of ice in our U.K. restaurants.”
 
“Nothing is more important than the safety of our customers and people and we will continue to review our procedures and training, working closely with our restaurant teams to ensure those procedures are adhered to at all times,” the spokesperson said.
 
McDonald’s also cited comments from Tom Humphrey, professor of bacteriology and food safety:
 
“It is pleasing that Escherichia coli (E. coli), the bacterium that is the most accurate and reliable indicator of fecal contamination, was not found in any ice samples from McDonald’s restaurants.
 
“Low levels of two other indicator bacteria, coliforms and enterococci, were found in some ice samples. These can be used as an assessment of water hygiene but, as they are widely distributed in the natural environment, they are not reliable indicators of potential health risks.”

2191,"Brexit talks stutter, but EU leaders might give May break","European Union's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier holds a joint news conference with Britain's Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union David Davis (unseen) on progress in this week's latest round of negotiations on Britain's withdrawal from the European Union, Belgium September 28, 2017. REUTERS/Francois Lenoir
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union negotiators see no big breakthrough in a new round of Brexit talks from Monday nor when Theresa May attends a summit next week, yet leaders could offer the beleaguered British prime minister a hand, EU officials believe.
Talks which began on Monday in Brussels have a thin schedule - British Brexit Secretary David Davis is to meet EU negotiator Michel Barnier on Tuesday and again on Thursday. But Wednesday is blank on the timetable and officials will not touch on the knottiest outstanding problem - how much Britain pays the EU.
That all but rules out “miracles” on key divorce issues that Barnier’s boss says are needed for May’s 27 fellow EU leaders to agree to open the talks she wants on a post-Brexit free trade pact when they all meet in Brussels next Thursday and Friday.
The prime minister revived an increasingly sour dialogue two weeks ago by offering concessions in a speech in Florence. But talks that followed left big gaps on three core issues on which the EU demands “significant progress” before Barnier can so much as mention what happens after Britain leaves in 18 months time.
Yet such is the opposition to compromise that May faces within her own party that many EU diplomats think leaders could give her some hope at the summit to help her face down calls for Britain to simply walk out without a deal - an eventuality that the Europeans are nonetheless preparing for.
“My guess is the leaders will try to find some positive elements,” one senior diplomat told Reuters, saying May could be offered hope of a “landing zone” for accords to let the next scheduled summit, in mid-December, approve trade talks.
This week could see further movement on agreeing rights for expatriate citizens, where the role of EU judges is in dispute. But few see much movement on the Irish border or on the money.
And with May and the EU batting back and forth assertions that the ball is in the other’s court, attention is fast turning from this week’s meetings to next week’s summit.

ENCOURAGEMENT FOR MAY
Not one of over a dozen senior EU officials and diplomats who spoke to Reuters expect the summit to launch talks on future trade, few rule out that May’s counterparts may give her some assurance of doing so soon - and even offer some limited exploration of the transition period she has asked for.
“She is in a difficult situation, if she goes out there and there is nothing tangible on our side,” a senior EU official said, saying governments wanted to keep up momentum for a deal that would avoid legal chaos across Europe. “We’ll try to be neutral, maybe even offer an encouraging line to stay engaged.”
Nonetheless, governments are extremely wary of any attempt by British negotiators to divide their solid display of unity and are anxious not to appear to be going soft on May, despite some sympathy for the balancing act she faces.
On Friday, envoys from many of the 27 including heavyweights Germany and France opposed suggestions from Barnier that they might start some preliminary discussion of what exactly will happen in the transition period immediately after Brexit.
“This situation is not a reason for the Commission to loosen its guidelines,” a senior official from a big EU power said of May’s domestic woes. “I believe she really wants a deal but we can’t alter our negotiating stance because of that.”
Nonetheless, several diplomats said leaders could soften the stance on transition talks by next week. Leaders say they will not negotiate directly with May and want to channel everything through Barnier. But May’s powerful peers may find it hard to sit back and watch her fail, provoking further British turmoil.
“The leaders want to lead, they want to make history,” said another senior EU diplomat who said the summiteers could break next week from the advice of their own officials. “Who can say that they won’t just say, ‘OK, let’s just get on with it’?”

2032,Buy ‘Em or Deny ‘Em: Is Chris Johnson A Worthy Fantasy Option?,"Buy ‘Em or Deny ‘Em: Is Chris Johnson A Worthy Fantasy Option?
% of readers think this story is Fact. Add your two cents.
(Before It's News)
by Eric Stashin (aka The Rotoprofessor)
According to Darren Urban (via Twitter):
“Arians, on @AZSports, said Chris Johnson will remain the starting”
Of course Johnson disappointed in a starting role on Monday night:
Chris Johnson – 13 touches for 21 yards
Andre Ellington – 10 touches for 81 yards
The Cardinals were trailing in the fourth quarter, and that may have led to more opportunities for Ellington. You also had Johnson continuing to get up to speed, and another week of practice/action will only help improve his performance.
Than we have the Week 4 opponent, as it is highly unlikely that the San Francisco 49ers get out to a big lead. They are also allowing the sixth most points per week to opposing running backs, including the seventh most rushing yards (323). They’ve faced the fourth most rushing attempts (85), so you want to keep it in perspective, but that also speaks to the team falling behind and opponents managing the clock.
Johnson isn’t going to be a stellar option, but he’s going to dominate early down carries and has a positive matchup. With the Cardinals potentially getting out to a big lead and wanting to get Johnson going, it all comes together for a potentially solid day.
Consider him more of a low-end RB2, at best, and a FLEX option in all formats. In other words, depending on your alternatives he’s a worthy play in all formats (though not quite as attractive in PPR).

665,"Thai air safety upgrade opens up growing China, Korea, Japan markets","BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thai airlines can now add flights to the growing China, South Korea and Japan markets after the U.N. International Civil Aviation Organization removed a red flag against Thailand over safety concerns, officials said on Monday.
Thailand was downgraded in June 2015 after its regulator missed a deadline to resolve significant safety concerns, meaning that airlines were unable to add further international routes, though they could continue to operate routine flights.
The Civil Aviation Authority of Thailand (CAAT) said the ICAO had made the decision after a meeting on Friday. The Montreal-based U.N. agency was not immediately available for comment, but the red flag which appeared against Thailand on its website had disappeared.
“Although lifting the red flag is a significant turning point for her aviation industry, Thailand as well as CAAT need to carry on their missions to improve the aviation safety standards,” the CAAT said on its website.
AIRLINE SHARES JUMP
Shares in Thai Airways climbed nearly 8 percent on the news before falling back to trade at over 5 percent higher. Shares in Asia Aviation, which operates as Thai Air Asia, rose as much as 5 percent and later traded up nearly 4 percent. Shares in airport operator Airports of Thailand rose over 2 percent.
The biggest beneficiaries would be smaller carriers, such as Thai AirAsia X, NokScoot and Thai Lion, said Corrine Png, the CEO of Singapore-based transport research firm Crucial Perspective.
“The ICAO downgrade had seriously impeded these new entrants’ growth to lucrative markets such as Japan and South Korea,” she said. “These airlines can now grow more aggressively. This would, however, imply increased competition for Thai Airways when they expand.”
Thai AirAsia X CEO Nadda Buranasiri said his airline was studying new routes, including to Hokkaido in Japan, after the red flag was lifted.
“We will likely increase routes and frequencies for China, South Korea, and Japan,” he told Reuters on Monday, adding Thai AirAsia X now hoped to add three to four aircraft to its fleet next year.
Nok Airlines PCL Vice Chairman Patee Sarasin said new routes would be added as slots became available.
Thai Airways lacks enough aircraft to take advantage of the situation and expects rivals will boost routes to other Asian countries, said a source at the national carrier who declined to be named because he wasn’t authorized to speak to the media. Thai Airways declined to comment.
U.S. YET TO UPGRADE
CAAT director general Chula Sukmanop told a news conference that he expected Thailand would regain a Category One status from the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), which also downgraded Thailand in 2015. The FAA downgrade meant Thai carriers could not start new routes to the United States.
The CAAT said its aim was to be at “the world’s forefront” in safety and reach the global average in each safety category. Actions were still needed to address findings of an ICAO inspection in January 2015 and an audit in July, it said.
ICAO’s red flag was based on its audit of the regulatory body, rather than individual airlines. Some major Thai airlines, including Thai Airways, Bangkok Airways, Thai Lion and NokScoot, have passed the International Air Transport Association Operational Safety Audit, a benchmark for global safety management in airlines.
Aviation safety is particularly important for Thailand given that tourism accounts for around 12 percent of its economy, the second largest in Asia.
The countries which still have red flags against them are Djibouti, Eritrea, Haiti, Kyrgyzstan and Malawi, according to the ICAO list.

2573,A New Street Was Meant to Bridge Belfast’s Sectarian Divide. Then the Doorbell Rang.,"For several days afterward, those who fled were forced to stay in a different friend’s house each night, said the cook, who asked that he and his fiancée not be named because he felt their lives were still in danger.
This kind of intimidation is not new in Northern Ireland, nor does it appear to be on the rise. Around 30 people have declared themselves homeless for similar reasons each year for the past half-decade, according to statistics provided by the Northern Irish government, and this year’s figure of 33 is no departure from that trend.
But the recent episodes at Cantrell Close have made headlines in Northern Ireland because they occurred in a place that was intended to be a foundation stone for a post-sectarian society. It has also raised concerns about certain politicians’ commitment to the process of integration, and about the ability of the Northern Irish police to curb the influence of sectarian paramilitary groups.
“This is a very good illustration of a much deeper problem,” said Stephen Farry, a lawmaker from the Alliance Party, which tries to bridge the divides between the province’s Unionists and nationalist communities. “Northern Ireland is not yet a peaceful society. We have ongoing coercive control by paramilitary structures at a local level across many communities.”
A recent stroll down Cantrell Close, a tiny T-shaped cul-de-sac, did not make this instantly obvious. At first sight, it was a picture of prim, docile suburbia: 41 two-story homes, each with a tidy lawn and a garden fence, lined a quiet road with a shiny bike rack at one end and a speed bump at the other. The tensions became apparent only when you looked toward the sky.
Flying from some of the lampposts were the flags of the Ulster Volunteer Force, or U.V.F., a banned terrorist group that killed more than 400 people during the Northern Irish Troubles, mostly targeting Catholics and Irish nationalists, or those opposed to Northern Ireland remaining part of the United Kingdom.
No faction has claimed responsibility, but the police believe that the threats came from people purporting to be part of the U.V.F. Two men have been questioned in connection to the crime, on suspicion of membership in the group.

The East Belfast Community Initiative, which says it mediates on behalf of former U.V.F. combatants, said the U.V.F. was not involved. Cantrell Close, meanwhile, is just one of many streets in East Belfast lined with the group’s flags.

On Cantrell Close itself, there appears to be an informal omertà in place. Of those who answered their doors on a recent afternoon, none would discuss the threats to their former neighbors.
One man even claimed he knew nothing at all about the situation, his mouth curling into a faint smile.
Some outside the neighborhood have been more outspoken, however, about a culture of impunity that they believe encouraged whoever made the threats.

Before moving in, residents of Cantrell Close signed pledges against the display of controversial flags. The government also says it is illegal to fly the flags of terrorist groups.
Yet when the U.V.F. flags suddenly appeared in June, no action was taken either to find the perpetrators or to remove them, creating the impression that sectarianism would be tolerated even at such a symbolic housing development.
“The police, who you’d expect to lead, didn’t,” said Mairtin O Muilleoir, a lawmaker from Sinn Fein, an Irish nationalist party. “And the gangs were emboldened.”
Local unionist politicians were also perceived to take too weak a stance back in June.
“I’ll always be cautious about causation and correlation,” said Cillian McGrattan, a politics professor at Ulster University. But the reaction of politicians from the Democratic Unionist Party, or D.U.P., to sectarian episodes during the summer, including the Cantrell Close issue, “really left a lot to be desired,” he added.
Asked for comment, Emma Little-Pengelly, one of the party lawmakers facing criticism, said she had been clear in June about her opposition to paramilitary flags. She and a D.U.P. colleague also issued an immediate condemnation of last month’s threats to Catholic residents.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Belfast’s top policeman meanwhile suggested that the flags had not been deemed problematic enough to justify their removal back in June.
“The reality is that while we understand the public’s frustration in this matter, police will only act to remove flags if there are substantial risks to public safety,” Chief Superintendent Chris Noble said in an emailed statement.
(The flags were taken down only several days after the threats were made.)
For the young cook and his fiancée, these explanations mean little. They feel frustrated at the authorities for doing nothing in the first place to remove the flags, which they said were clearly intimidating. They feel abandoned by the police for failing, once the threats were made, to provide a permanent presence on the street.
And they fault the housing authorities for failing to quickly find them alternative accommodations — and for assuring them that the street was safe to move to.
The cook’s fiancée, a 20-year-old waitress, said officials should have recognized her vulnerability as a young mother with a newborn in tow before encouraging her to move in.
Politicians like Mr. O Muilleoir hope the episodes at Cantrell Close will not derail plans for more integrated housing projects. “In Europe in 2017, we either let an armed gang dictate policy,” he said, “or we step things up.”
But for the targeted families themselves, the integration dream is over. From now on, the cook said, his family would stick to neighborhoods with a Catholic majority.",fake
3080,Zinke's travel continues to raise ethical questions,"Washington (CNN) Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke has mixed official business with political activities and visits home, raising questions about the appropriateness of the trips and whether any ethics rules have been violated.
Zinke's travel is under investigation by both the Office of Special Counsel and the Interior Department's inspector general.
Travel by Cabinet officials has been under the microscope since then-Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price was found to take private flights costing hundreds of thousands of dollars and resigned. But it's not just the cost of private travel that has ethics officials looking at Zinke's schedule.
Just weeks after officially becoming interior secretary, Zinke traveled on March 30 to the US Virgin Islands for official business. He attended a series of meetings with local government officials and veterans as well as a Republican party fundraiser that cost between $75 to $5,000 to gain access.
In May, Zinke tacked on a political event to a multi-day work trip in Alaska. On May 31, after days of meeting with business leaders, government officials, veterans and native groups, Zinke attended a campaign reception for Republican Rep. Don Young of Alaska. Young's campaign spokesman, Matt Shuckerow, said Zinke was there for 15 to 20 minutes and he gave brief remarks.
""Everything associated with Congressman Young's event was done by the book,"" Shuckerow said. ""Not only did the campaign seek out the guidance of the Interior Department's ethics personnel prior to the event, it took concerted efforts to follow their strict guidance.""
Shuckerow also told CNN Zinke's attendance was not confirmed in advance or advertised to guests on invitations or other formal communications and, at the event, the secretary was not referred to by his title at his request. Shuckerow added, ""There were no costs associated with entrance or attendance by guests."" It is unclear if there were any other costs associated with getting Zinke to the event and who paid for it.
CNN has asked the Interior Department whether portions of the trip that involved political activities were allocated and subsidized by an entity other than the federal government. The agency has not responded.
Federal law does not ban political activity but it does limit certain political activities by federal employees, which is meant to ensure that programs are administered in a nonpartisan fashion and protect employees from political coercion in the workplace, according to the Office of Special Counsel's website.
Those trips are in addition to a widely reported trip to Las Vegas, where Zinke met with the Vegas Golden Knights hockey team, owned by billionaire businessman Bill Foley, whom Zinke called ""a major donor"" when he was running for Congress in 2014.
It remains unclear whether any laws were broken, but ethics watchdog groups say Zinke's official travel mixed with political activity are at the very least bad optics.
""To be a secretary of a department you would think the initial focus in the first year in office would be getting the department organized and initiatives taken care of,"" said Virginia Canter, the executive branch ethics counsel for Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. ""What's a bit unusual here is so quickly after getting into office Zinke is quickly engaged in political activity. It is a distraction.""
In a joint statement, Melinda Loftin, director of the department's ethics office, and Edward Keable, deputy solicitor, write, ""The Scheduling Office meets regularly with the Departmental Ethics Office and the Division of General Law to ensure that all travel is thoroughly reviewed and approved in advance and that it is fully compliant with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations.""
Ethics experts say Zinke can engage in certain political activities if his title as secretary is not used and he does not use any government resources. Federal employees cannot fundraise but they can speak at fundraisers. There are no allegations that Zinke either used his title or raised funds
But the question ethics watchdogs are raising is whether it's a little too coincidental that his official duties are coinciding with his political activities.
""Is he using the official travel to subsidize his political activity?"" asked Canter. ""You have to follow a very specific formula to make sure if you're on official business the money is allocated in accordance with the regulations.""
House Democrats who sit on the committee that oversees the Interior Department wrote a letter to the inspector general also raising concerns about Zinke's mix of political activities and official business.
Watchdogs question trips home
Ethics watchdogs question whether official business was scheduled in a way that would allow Zinke to frequently visit his home in Montana.
Records show of six trips to Zinke's home state at least three times included time at his house from March to August.
An Interior Department official calls such allegations ""ridiculous,"" noting the state is full of department ""lands, offices, and assets.""
On March 9, Zinke took a 4:08 pm flight from Washington to an airport about 23 minutes from his Montana home, according to his Interior Department schedule. Once arriving in his home state, he spent the night at home. The next day he spent four hours at Glacier National Park which included meetings with park staff. His schedule says by 1:00 pm he was en route to return home where he spent the rest of the day. He left on the March 11 to make another stop in another part of Montana and then stayed overnight in Missoula.
On May 12, Zinke returned to Montana. Zinke's schedule says he had meetings with tribal leaders and energy producers and a horseback tour of a mine with Vice President Mike Pence on May 12. Later that evening, Zinke attended a rally for congressional candidate Greg Gianforte who was running for the seat Zinke left to lead the Interior Department. A picture tweeted from Zinke's official twitter account shows him with Pence and Gianforte with the caption ""rallying the grassroots.""
The next day Saturday, May 13, Zinke took a personal day, spending the night at his home in Whitefish. His schedule indicates he used a rental car that he paid for himself for the personal travel.
On the morning of June 27, Zinke was again in Whitefish where he gave a speech to the Western Governors' Association, a bipartisan group. That afternoon he visited the nearby Glacier National Park for a photo shoot with GQ magazine and an interview with Outside magazine, and later attended what his schedule notes was a ""Wildlife Encounter Discussion."" That evening Zinke would spend the night and next morning at his home in Whitefish, according to his schedule.",fake

1350,"Las Vegas killer had more explosives, 1,600 rounds of ammo in car","(CNN) Chilling new clues suggest the man behind the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history planned to inflict even more carnage.
He also had more than 50 pounds of explosives and 1,600 rounds of ammunition in his car in the hotel parking lot, police said.
Investigators now believe Paddock intended to survive the massacre, Las Vegas police Sheriff Joseph Lombardo said Wednesday.
""He was doing everything possible to see how he could escape,"" Lombardo said, declining to detail specifics.
But what motivated Paddock to kill dozens of strangers -- and where he planned to strike next -- remains a mystery.
Law enforcement analyst: Car bomb possible
Of the explosives found in Paddock's car, authorities first found several pounds of ammonium nitrate, Lombardo said.
He said a later search of cases found in the car revealed 50 pounds of Tannerite -- a brand-name product that's marketed as explosive rifle targets.
The cache of explosives in Paddock's car could indicate plans for a car bomb, CNN law enforcement analyst Art Roderick said.
""Those explosives, that's the scary part. What was he going to do with those? I mean, you don't just acquire them and leave them in your vehicle and not have a plan for them,"" said Roderick, former assistant director of the US Marshals Service.
""The Tannerite could have set off the ammonium nitrate,"" Roderick said. ""So, was he using that as a vehicle-borne explosive device?""
It's possible no one will ever learn Paddock's plan for the explosives. The gunman killed himself before police breached his hotel room door.
Booking rooms near other music festivals
Before checking into Mandalay Bay days before the massacre, Paddock rented a room at a Las Vegas condo complex that overlooked another music festival.
Paddock rented the room at the Ogden condo complex via Airbnb during the Life is Beautiful music festival, which lasted from September 22 to 25, the sheriff said.
""Was he doing pre-surveillance? We don't know yet. This is all conjecture at this point,"" Lombardo said.
And in August, a person named Stephen Paddock reserved a room at Chicago's Blackstone Hotel during the city's Lollapalooza music festival, said Wagstaff Worldwide, which represents the hotel.
But that person never checked into the hotel, which overlooked the festival, WWM spokeswoman Emmy Carragher said.
It was not immediately clear whether the Stephen Paddock who booked the room was the same Stephen Paddock behind the Las Vegas massacre.
Wagstaff Worldwide said Blackstone Hotel is cooperating with authorities.
A new timeline
New evidence shows Paddock fired his first shots into the Route 91 Harvest music festival at 10:05 p.m. Sunday -- three minutes earlier than what police previously reported, Lombardo said.
For 10 minutes, Paddock sprayed hundreds of bullets into the crowd about a quarter mile away. The shots pummeled the gathering of 22,000 people with devastating speed, due to the help of bump stocks -- legal accessories that make weapons fire similarly to an automatic rifle.
As the indiscriminate killings continued, police said, cameras were positioned inside and outside Paddock's hotel suite and in the door's peep hole.
People scramble after gunfire strikes the Route 91 Harvest country music festival in Las Vegas.
A security guard approached the 32nd-floor suite and was shot in the leg by Paddock . The 64-year-old gunman fired ""well over 200 rounds"" into the hallway, Lombardo said.
""It's amazing that security guard didn't sustain additional injury,"" the sheriff said.

At 10:15 p.m., Paddock fired his last shots, police said. Three minutes later, the wounded security guard told Las Vegas police he'd been shot and directed officers to the gunman's room.
More than an hour later, at 11:20 p.m., police first breached Paddock's suite and found his body on the ground. Seven minutes later, officers gained access to a second room of the suite. No one else was found, and police declared the suspect ""down.""
The elusive motive
As more than 100 investigators dig for answers, police aren't sure what turned a retired accountant into a mass killer.
""What we know is Stephen Paddock is a man who spent decades acquiring weapons and ammo, and living a secret life, much of which will never be fully understood,"" the sheriff said.
A man tries to shield a woman from gunfire. The photographer reported she later got up.
Investigators said something may have happened to Paddock between October 2016 and last month that compelled him to purchase more weapons. Paddock bought 33 firearms, mostly rifles, during that period, an ATF spokesperson said.
A note was found in Paddock's Mandalay Bay hotel room, but it was not a suicide note, the sheriff said. He did not detail what the note said.
No evidence indicates terrorism, FBI special agent Aaron Rouse said, but the investigation is ongoing.
Girlfriend: He sent me to the Philippines
Investigators want to know whether Paddock's girlfriend, Marilou Danley, has information that can explain what sparked the massacre.
Danley flew Tuesday to Los Angeles from the Philippines and has been cooperating with authorities, Rouse said.
Danley, through her attorney, said that she didn't know Paddock planned to carry out a mass shooting.
so she could buy a house there, she said in a statement. At the time, she She said he bought her a ticket to the Philippines about two weeks ago, then wired her moneyso she could buy a house there, she said in a statement. At the time, she worried he was trying to break up with her , she said.
Paddock wired $100,000 to the Philippines, a law enforcement source said, but officials haven't determined when the money transfer took place or who received it. The FBI is working with Philippine authorities to get more details.
""It never occurred to me in any way whatsoever that he was planning violence against anyone,"" Danley said in the statement. ""I will cooperate fully with their investigation. Anything I can do to help ease suffering and help in any way, I will do.""
The hunt for possible accomplices

Authorities are investigating whether Paddock acted alone or had accomplices. Lombardo, the sheriff, expressed skepticism that the gunman worked solo.
""Do you think this was all accomplished on his own? You've got to make the assumption he had to have some help at some point,"" he said.
Lombardo cited the arsenal of lethal equipment found in Paddock's homes in Reno and Mesquite, Nevada.
In Reno, authorities found five handguns, two shotguns and a ""plethora"" of ammunition.
In his Mesquite home, investigators found at least 19 more firearms, as well as explosives and several thousand rounds of ammunition.
""It's troublesome this individual was able to move this amount of gear into a hotel room unassisted,"" Lombardo said. "" It's troublesome for the amount of stuff he had at both residences unassisted.""

1852,11 Drill by School Official Threatening to Kill Them,"By Matt Agorist
Honolulu, HI — In America’s modern-day police state, it seems the state knows no bounds as to how far it will go to keep children and adults in a perpetual state of fear. A recent lawsuit out of Hawaii illustrates the extent of the American fear culture and how its insanity is tormenting and traumatizing America’s youth.
For more than 10 minutes, middle school children were held hostage by a raging lunatic in a mask, swinging a hammer while threatening to kill them all. Naturally, officials claim this drill, involving a school official wearing a mask and holding a hammer while threatening to kill children, was done for the “safety of those children.” Well, Michelle and Eddie Chavez aren’t buying that excuse.
According to a report from Courthouse News, the couple has since filed a federal lawsuit over this incident.
An abusive lockdown drill in which a masked man threatened a middle-school classroom with a hammer left the entire class in tears and at least one girl with post-traumatic stress disorder, her parents say in court. Michelle and Eddie Chavis sued Hawaii and the state Department of Education on Sept. 7 in First Circuit state Court. According to the bizarre complaint, their daughter and her class at Kaimuki Middle were watching a video about the Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks on Sept. 11, 2015. Suddenly, “a man wearing a mask rushed into the classroom swinging a large hammer while threatening the students with serious bodily injury and/or death,” the complaint states. The complaint continues: “Minor and her classmates were immediately placed in fear for their lives. The masked man then walked out of the classroom with the classroom teacher running out behind the masked man, apparently in pursuit of the masked man. Upon the classroom teacher’s return, the teacher locked the classroom doors and called the school office to notify the school administration of the masked man. “Minor and other students in the classroom were crying and feared for their lives, as they believed they were going to be killed. The classroom teacher was pacing around the classroom and appeared scared, as well.” Only then, the parents say, did the school administration announce that it was a lockdown drill, planned ahead of time, “to be as realistic as possible.” The Chavis’s daughter already had been under the case of a psychologist for two years, and the school knew it, they say. She continues to suffer from the stress of the drill, and post-traumatic stress syndrome. Her parents seek damages and special damages for negligence, breach of duty of care, personal injuries, medical expenses and loss of enjoyment of life. They are represented by Harrison Kiehm.
After the drill first became public in 2015, school officials were quick to defend the decision. In response to an inquiry from KHON 2 news, the Department of Education released a statement at the time noting, “Safety drills provide real-life situations where schools can analyze areas of strengths and weaknesses. In order to accomplish this, students are not notified when a drill will take place.”
According to KHON, the principal at Kaimuki Middle School told KHON2 sometimes they do notify students about these lockdown drills and sometimes they don’t, and they don’t plan on changing that because they want to make sure they know how students will react during these very different situations.
According to psychologist Dr. Suzanne Gelb, however, these experiences “can be very devastating. It can result in nightmares. It can be a result in a resurgence of problem behaviors that maybe were taken care of already, like rebelliousness, acting out.” Many of the parents whose children witnessed this drill agree.
Parents, who did not want to be identified, told KHON2 their kids were in tears and terrorized by the scene.
“(My child has had) sleepless nights since it’s happened, very anxious, concerned about going to school,” one parent said.
The student said at least six kids in her class were crying during the drill.
Another parent said her daughter “was afraid, and she was crying, and another friend was crying as well, and they thought they were going to die.”
What, exactly, the school was attempting to ‘teach’ the kids with this drill remains to be seen. No lessons were learned and the end result was simply a long list of traumatized children.

625,The 2016 Winner Of The Award For Reverse Excellence,"By Brandon Turbeville
Toward the end of every year, it has become a Western tradition to initiate the proceedings of a “round up” or “best of” of the people, events, and products of the year and attempt to crown a number of individuals with awards for the most accomplished, best dressed, most influential, or most creative of that year. The world of politics and government is no different. Since Wall Street and the Corporate world essentially function as government as well, it is natural that anyone in banking, finance, or the business of exploitation and the military industrial complex be eligible for recognition as well.
However, while politicians, government officials, corporate overlords, and financiers are awash with awards and backslapping trophies, there was still no official award provided to them at the end of the year for their life’s accomplishments and those made over the past 12 months. We decided in 2015, it was time to change this.
Please note: We apologize for being so late in announcing our winner for 2016. Last year contained a number of events that nearly resulted in the complete destruction of the United States and our staff was focused on survival and neurosis for most of the year. We promise to be more prompt in the future.
A Little About The Award For Reverse Excellence
In our attempt to devise the perfect, comprehensive award, we asked ourselves what such an award would look like? We already have the Nobel Peace Prize, a perfect Orwellian award whose name says “peace” but is generally awarded to mass murderers, warmongers, and proponents of genocidal austerity. Unfortunately, we find the Nobel Prize is no longer able to provide us with the pride and confidence in the world’s leaders who are responsible for the killing of innocent people and the destruction of their livelihoods in the way that we desire. Unable to understand the concept of doublethink, the general public is confused by the use of the word “peace” in the title of the prize and thus they believe that the “peace” prize is actually a prize for peace. For that reason, they often see the recipients as weak and ineffectual despite their accomplishments.
So the award we wanted to create needed to have a title that sums up the true genuine accomplishments of the recipient while, at the same time, appealing to the sense of admiration we have for anyone in a position of authority and the abject fear we feel at the possibility of angering them.
We considered naming the honor “The Excellence Award,” but it was brought to our attention that a distinct minority of people do not view genocide, war, foreign invasions, austerity, violence, environmental degradation, and police states as excellent. Thus, due to our desire to be politically correct and to decry white supremacy at every turn, we decided that no minorities should be excluded and we opted to change the name to “The Reverse Excellence Award” in order to placate the minority who opposes war, resting fairly assured that the term “reverse” will be completely above the heads of the majority that supports it. We also very much liked the Orwellian nature of it.
Our biggest challenge was who should receive the award, since there truly are so many qualified candidates.
Our Selection Process
The old standards such as Henry Kissinger and Zbigniew Brzezinski were obvious choices since both have been responsible for the deaths of millions of people yet still remain[ed] free to walk in the halls of power, a true testament to their psychopathy and the corruption of the entire American system. Unfortunately for those who love death, Mr. Brzezinski passed over the same river as the millions he sent across early and Henry Kissinger has already received the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to exterminate the “useless eaters” As a result, we have determined that both Kissinger and Brzezinski have “Been there. Done that.”
John McCain was considered due to his role in the drumming up of support for each and every maniacal military adventure presented to the American people as an option (and many that have yet to be presented) and his concurrent affiliation with terrorist leaders while claiming that the maniacal military adventures he supports would be used to destroy the terrorist organizations he also supports. Truly, any man that cavorts with kidnappers, Caliphs, and cannibals deserves an award. Having repeatedly demonstrated his senility, fighting a battle with cancer, and still managing to exist as a cancer himself is indeed impressive. However, it was determined there was no point in bestowing an award on someone who would not remember it.
The obvious choice – Barack Obama – was of course floated before the committee. Obama has presided over a number of wars, color revolutions, and near thermonuclear confrontations. He has driven every possible nail into the coffin of the American economy and has set out on a personal crusade against the Constitution and civil liberties. His radical jihad against gun rights and privacy protections, his selfless push to increase the proliferation of GM foods as well as his implementation of Obamacare certainly give him a chance at the Reverse Excellence Award. Obama’s star, however, is fading and we do not wish to bestow an award for a fading star.
Donald Trump edged in as a potential candidate due to his inflammatory suggestions that religious tests be used to determine entry into the country, walls be built on the borders, Muslims be “banned,” mosques be “monitored,” the Internet be “shut down,” protesters be beaten, cops be given more authority to beat and maim, and that internment camps are viable options. While inflammatory statements alone are not enough to receive the award for “Reverse Excellence,” the fact that Trump was able to bring along much of the more conservative alternative media – previously opposed to all of the above – is quite the achievement. In addition, he managed to turn more leftist alternative media outlets into blank-staring Democrats. Well done, Donald. Unfortunately for Trump, however, he simply had not been around long enough on the political scene to receive an award for his worthy efforts and, since his presidency began in 2017, he will not be legitimately eligible until next year.
Thus, the winner was the only logical choice for 2016. Due to her commitment to Constitution-shredding legislation, war, genocide, tainted food, austerity, chemical poisoning, murder, compulsive lying and unmitigated psychopathy amongst many other qualities and commitments, our 2016 winner of the Reverse Excellence award goes to none other than Hillary Clinton. This will make Hillary our two-time winner of the Award for Reverse Excellence.
Below are only a few of the reasons why Hillary Clinton is the winner of our first annual award:
The Clinton Cackle: We Came. We Saw. He Died. The Killing Of Ghaddafi And The Destruction of Libya. Benghazi The Funding Of Al-Qaeda Terrorists In Libya And Syria Rabid Anti-Gun Obsession Pro-Vaccine Propaganda Clinton’s Pro-War Record Clinton’s Attack On Bashar Al-Assad The Fake Bin Laden Killing And The Fake Photos That Accompanied It Generally speaking, being as fake as a wedding cake in all aspects of her life Getting A Pedophile Off The Hook And Then Bragging About It Working For Wall Street! The Clinton Foundation Support For GMOs Connections To Bill Gates Getting Her Marching Orders From The CFR Supporting the TARP and the Banker Bailout Changing Positions At Every Election Receiving Praise From Neocons Her Infamous Christmas Tree Decorations Pimping Obamacare Before Obama And The Republicans Connections To George Soros Supporting War With Iran Her Own War On Women Fracking Her War On Civil Liberties The Family and The Fellowship Supporting NAFTA and the TPP Emailgate The Clinton Body Count Hillary’s Support For Israel Supported By Major Oil and Gas Giants Wal-Mart Connections Hillary Is Anti-Labor and Anti-Working Class The Climate Obsession The Immigration Issue Pro-Drug War Pro-Police State
Keep in mind, this was all achieved before her failed political campaign for president. Had this been her only accomplishment during the year 2016, she would not have won a second time. However, Hillary has proven that she is not a woman who will be kept down by limitations, opposition, facts, morality, ethics, a soul, or the overwhelming hatred half the population has for her. Hillary smashed the “glass ceiling” once before and now, in her seventies, she is trying to destroy the whole house and everyone in it.
Congratulations to Hillary Clinton, the original Wicked Witch Of The West (OK, Margaret Thatcher qualifies for that title too), on her award for Reverse Excellence. Clinton has managed to not only commit these immoral, illegal, and embarrassing acts but she has managed to survive every well-earned scandal that has come as a result of it and still having so little shame that she managed to “win” the nomination for President. She Came. She Saw. She Won. Sure, she had to run against an aging socialist who refused to stand up to her, cut himself off at the knees every day, and campaigned for her but she also was forced to rig the entire process in 50 states! That’s no small feat, even for a Clinton.
Indeed, it was her actions after her loss to Donald Trump (yes, Donald Trump) that really showed us all who Hillary Clinton is as a person. Yes, she was the first lady. Yes, she worked for Walmart and tried to break unions. Yes, she repeatedly attacked rape victims and helped rapists walk free. Yes, she was Senator. Yes, she supported the PATRIOT Act, the war in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Yemen, Iran, and North Korea. Yes, she supported Free Trade like NAFTA and the Chinese trade agreements! Yes, she was a psychopathic murderer. Yes, she bounced back after losing miserably to Barack Obama in 2008. BUT! She bounced right back and lost to Donald Trump in 2016!
And what did she do after she lost? Did she cry and go home in humiliation? Of course not! Hillary Clinton brushed the dust off her shoulder, went on a rampage of insults against the incoming President, labeled herself as the leader of the “resistance,” and wrote a book of excuses as to why she lost to Trump that are too numerous to list in this article. In addition, she concocted one of the most ridiculous conspiracy theories of our time – the Russians did it [everything] – which went on to nearly cripple the country until “Nazis” and “North Koreans” came along.
It is for this reason that Hillary has truly earned her place as a two-time winner of the Award For Reverse Excellence.

2089,Passing Game Film Review - Good McCown - Week 3 (Dolphins),"Passing Game Film Review – Good McCown – Week 3 (Dolphins)
(Before It's News)
We’re back with another weekly breakdown of the passing game, and this one comes after a rare win for the Jets. Josh McCown looked much better, and the offensive system looks improved as well. Let’s see the good plays from this past game:
1)
This play is a good example of how play action, and a running game, helps the passing game. Notice the linebacker in the middle on the play, and how hard he bites on the play action. The corner back playing Anderson is taking outside leverage, which means he wants to filter Anderson towards the middle, and the line backer is tasked with taking the underneath route away, while the deep safety takes away the deep middle part of the field. The read on this play is simple, it’s the linebacker that bites on the play action. If the defender stays home, then it’s a longer developing play and you wait to see who the deep safety picks up, Anderson or Charone Peake from the slot. While Peake just got placed on injured reserve, you will see some of his route limitations here, because he telegraphs his route to the corner back. The defender is giving up inside leverage on this play, because that’s where he has help over the top with the safety, and linebackers designed to drop back. However, Peake gives away his route early because he turns inside, which allows the defender to turn his hips and move with him stride for stride. A better route would have been to attack the corner back vertically by going directly at him, which causes him to stay defensive since he can’t predict an inside or outside route, and then turning inside, which allows more time to create separation. In that scenario, you are even with the defender when he’s turning his hips, while you are still running vertically, which allows for natural separation. Overall, a very good route by Anderson and, good recognition and throw by McCown.
2)
The Dolphins employ an unusual blitz in this scenario, where they bring a slot corner and safety from the same spot, which more than likely is a mis-communication, especially considering the distance between the QB and the defenders. In most instances, on a corner or safety blitz, the defender nearby would pick up the receiver to avoid a quick throw. For example, if the slot corner is rightfully blitzing on this play, the safety assumes the role of the slot corner. In this instance, the defense is in complete disarray as they leave one person wide open, which happens to be Robby Anderson. If this play develops longer, the outside receiver Jermaine Kearse is going to run by the safety to be open down field, while Anderson will be open underneath him as well. The actual play doesn’t deal with any of them, because the primary read on this play is Austin-Seferian Jenkins. McCown is reading the middle linebacker on this play again, with crossing tight end routes. Whomever is picked up by the middle linebacker is eliminated, and the pass goes to the other tight end. McCown picks correctly and they get a sizable gain from this pass. It’s refreshing to see the Jets utilize the tight ends more in this offense because it gives the defense another dimension to worry about when planning their course of action.
3)
Staying with the middle linebacker reads, Josh McCown hits Kearse this time for a good chunk of yards. The read here is again the middle linebacker. If the linebacker sways towards Kearse, then Jenkins is cutting underneath for the open pass and room to run. If the linebacker stays in the middle, then Kearse is open for the easy pass, and McCown executes it well. As mentioned in the previous clip, the addition of frequent tight end routes limit the reaction time of linebackers because they have to account for tight ends running routes, unlike last year. Notice the route of Kerase here, and compare it to the route of Peake from the first clip. Kerase runs straight even though his defender is giving inside leverage, which causes the defender to pause, allowing for separation. There is a larger gap because the defender seems to be hesitant to follow Kearse to the middle, but it’s a good example of route running. He didn’t give away his route early, which limited the reaction time of the defender and helped him create separation. It’s a shame that Peake got hurt, because he could have learned a lot about route running from Kearse.
4)
This play doesn’t count since Kearse got called for a penalty, but it needs to be a staple in the play book because numerous teams take advantage of it, especially the Patriots. It’s essentially a pick play, similar to a setting a screen in basketball where one offensive player blocks the path of the defender playing another offensive player. It’s illegal to set a screen, but the rules are lax if you can make it seem like you are trying to run around, and just happened to be in the way of the defender. Ironically, Kearse was blamed heavily for not setting an effective screen on the infamous interception at the goal line in the Super Bowl. We also saw a similar play in the college football national championship game last year, where the University of Clemson won in the last minute. It’s a nice throw by McCown, and good catch but it’s all for naught. Kearse goes out of his way to set the pick, thus it can’t be interpreted as part of his route, and he rightfully gets called for the penalty. This play is here because the Jets need to utilize this play more often, and it’s a good sign that they are incorporating it into their offensive plan.
5)
ArDarius Stewart makes his presence known in this game with this wonderful catch. This is another feather in the cap for the offensive game plan, and comes on a 3rd and 13. The Jets are known to be conservative and this play is a big reason why they should take more chances down the field. First of all, look away from Stewart to the other side of the formation. The Jets have three receivers to the left side of the formation, but the defense has five defenders dedicated to the area. The Dolphins are in zone coverage, but it’s the deep route from the slot (looks like Kerley, hard to tell) that helps this play. The deep route keeps the single high safety planted in the middle. The second aspect of this pass is the running back out of the backfield, because he’s the one that occupies the underneath defender towards Stewart’s side. If the defender stays with Stewart, then throw to the running back in the open and hope he can make a guy miss in the open field. If the defender bites on the running back, a passing lane opens up for Stewart, and the opportunity for a first down. Josh McCown makes a great read on this play, but a mediocre throw. The ball is a bit ahead of Stewart, who make a diving catch to save the drive. Also notice the reactions of the defender because Stewart is running a straight route, as the defender can’t make up his mind if it’s an inside or out route. This hesitation causes the defender to slow down and speed up a couple of times during this route, and Stewart catches him at a critical point in the transition, which allows him more space when breaking down. It’s not an ideal route but better than the routes run by Peake, and shows a better knowledge of setting up defenders while in route.
6)
There are offensive systems that focus on individual match-ups and then there are systems that help the QB make quick reads at various levels of the field. Most systems intermingle between the two to keep defenses honest. Therefore, on certain plays, it’s up to the receivers to win their match ups to be open on the play, while in certain situations, it depends on spacing. This one would fall under the latter. The play is designed to give McCown options while on the run, and it works perfectly here and you can see it unfold. While it’s a simple play, the set up on this is very complex. First of all, the play action leaning towards the left side of the formation, the biggest intent of this is to freeze the linebackers on the right side of the formation instead of driving backwards. The lack of movement from the defenders robs them of momentum, while the offensive players are running full speed, therefore it creates drastic differences in velocity between the offensive and defensive player. All the players involved in the play are then running towards the right side of the formation at varying times, which creates different levels for the QB to pick. If the linebackers drop too far, then there is the quick route to Jenkins available as the safe option. If the linebackers come up, there is Charone Peake cutting across the field at the intermediate option. If the linebackers slow down a bit, Kerley has the angle to the sideline. If the deep safety sees Peake open and goes towards him, there is an offensive player running deep behind him for a TD. The options vary and the defense picks it’s poison, rather than the offensive players winning individual battles. Josh McCown probably picked the second best option, as Peake seemed to be the safer throw with opportunity to run down the field. The pass to Kerley is a bit towards the sideline, and the receiver makes a good catch as he goes out of bounds.
7)
This play occurs on 3rd and 22, and even the best offensive systems can’t draw up plays that are consistently successful in these situations. It’s actually a bad route by Kearse as he gives away his route and sticks to the inside defender, instead of gaining more separation first. The Dolphins decide to put the pressure on the Jets by having just a single high safety and leaving the middle of the field open for the pre-snap read. If Kearse does a better job of creating separation from the inside defender, he would have had an opportunity to run for yards after the catch. Nevertheless, this is a great throw by McCown, who puts it exactly where Kerase could catch the ball and gain 18 yards. It’s not enough for a first down, but made the field goal attempt much easier.
8)
It’s likely you missed this touchdown live, because most two minute drills for the team involve kneel downs and check downs. The Jets decided to take some shots this time, and got rewarded with a touchdown. The breakdown on this play is fairly simple, read the deep safety who has two deep routes coming towards him from opposite sides of the field. Pick the side that appears to be safer. McCown does a good job of picking the right side, and then making a great throw. This is probably one of the best throws of McCown’s short stay with the Jets. Notice the route by Anderson, and the slight movement to the outside when he gets off the line. This small movement creates just a tad more separation with the defender because he has to take half a step to make sure Anderson is going to the inside. Afterwards, the receiver just turns on the afterburners and runs by the defender. Jenkins does his best Warriors impression by celebrating even before the catch is made.
9)
Remember the play from earlier about tiers on a roll out? The Jets try this again, and the Dolphins are better prepared for it. The offense tries the same play fake to one side, roll out to the other with receivers running in tiers, but it’s defended better on this play. What makes the play for the Dolphins is the middle linebacker turning around to locate Robby Anderson and close the gap as soon as possible, limiting the choices for McCown. He does well to take the safe option to Jenkins, although if he had more time, there is an option open down the field for a come back route. Unfortunately, there isn’t enough time for that route to develop. This is one of the advantages of having tiered routes because it allows for built in hot reads (Jenkins), intermediate reads, and deep reads, depending on how much penetration is allowed by the offensive line.
10)
Almost a TD on this simple play. Why is it here? This is a 3rd and 1 play with the Jets looking like they are going to run. Instead, they decide to pass, and almost get a TD out of the play. Remember the failed play by Kearse, where he got called for interference? Well guess who is back running a pick play in a crucial moment and succeeding. Kerase does a better job of hiding his intentions here, and even tries to get out of the way once the defender has slowed down. The whole point of the pick play here is to allow a clean catch, and just enough yards to get the first down. Since it’s a short yardage situation, most likely the defense is in a run stopping package, which means any outside passes will be defended one on one. Therefore, by running the pick, Kearse is impeding the momentum of the defender and ensuring a clean opportunity for a catch. There is also a nice block down the field that helps springs Lawrence Thomas down the field. Thomas was a former running back at Michigan State University, who converted to the defensive line in college, so it’s definitely a surprise to see him run down the field.
11)
This is simply just a good throw by McCown where he put it in a place where only Kearse could catch the pass. It looks like there is sufficient evidence to call pass interference against either player, and Kearse does a good job of separating himself and catching the pass.
12)
Back to reading middle linebackers for Josh McCown. This is a 3rd and 6 play and the Dolphins are confused once again, and leave multiple players open. The read here is the middle linebacker for the QB. If the linebacker runs towards Kerley, then Jenkins is open for the pass in the middle. If the defender stays in the middle, Kerley is open on the slant route, which is what McCown chooses. The third read seems to be Charone Peake, who is also wide open on the play. McCown makes a good choice to get the first down and the drive continues.
Conclusion:
The Jets looked much better on offense in this game, than in the past two games. The offensive system seems to be generating more success, and the team isn’t as passive. Josh McCown took some shots down the field and got rewarded, which opened up the field for the Jets. The Dolphins did not have a good game plan for the Jets in this game, and their secondary play was suspect at best. Please check in tomorrow for out “McFrown” article to see the bad plays.
Forum Questions:
A) With Peake hurt, who do you think steps up? Hansen/Stewart?

1237,Freedom Exists Under Natural Law,"By Rosanne Lindsay
To know freedom is to know Nature. Living in harmony with Nature leads to peace, prosperity, knowledge, truth, action, and freedom. Nature reflects the order of the universe. Living in opposition to Nature leads to war, control, ignorance, fear, stagnation, and enslavement.
Today, America, The Land of the Free and Home of the Brave, finds herself in shackles and homeless. The foundation of American freedom is cracked. New restrictive mandates form the walls of a prison cell which we have built through our own apathy and ignorance. The original Charters of Freedom: The United States Constitution, The Bill of Rights, and The Declaration of Independence were written to reflect Inherent Rights of the individual. Yet these documents are being ignored by the very government created to uphold them because, by themselves, they are only metaphorical shields.
Why are we losing freedom?
Because we have forgotten where our rights come from. Human rights are natural and inborn, granted by the Creator. They come from our humanity under the Laws of Nature. Natural Law and Justice is, and always has been, the primary fundamental force in the universe. It is a body of Universal Spiritual Laws which governs Consciousness. Consciousness creates through each of us using free will. We are consciousness.
We have stopped taking action to secure freedom. We thought that when we created government in America as a Constitutional Republic, individuals would be recognized to hold certain inalienable rights; rights which are not transferable and which can never be revoked, regardless of what the majority wants, or who holds power. However what we have agreed to is a Democracy.
A Republic is where the people control the government. A Democracy, is where the Government controls the people.
When Rights Are Legalized
Rights granted and legalized by governments are not rights at all. In fact, they are privileges that can be altered restricted, and taken away by legislation or Executive Orders.
These privileges are codified (codes) in legalese. Legalese is the language of statutes, which redefines words as tools to expand the scope and power of the State. Under statutes, a “person” is a legal fiction, not a human being with free will. At the same time, a “corporation” is defined as “a number of persons united in one body, so it can acquire wealth, expand, and enjoy other rights.” Note: a corporation is incapable of loyalty or love. Governments also regulate behavior through licensure. A license is permission to do something otherwise deemed to be illegal.
A government that gives itself power by its own authority is a rogue government and must be restrained, or else the trend is toward a concentration of power where laws are homogenized and standardized to one-opinion rule -a monarchy. Unless we can wake ourselves up, the United Nations (UN) International treaties (UNCRC), intend to “reduce inequality” by implementing new norms of global socialism and corporate fascism as part of their Post-2015 Sustainable Development Goals.
What is Freedom?
To go to the next level in human evolution is to return more deeply into Nature. That is where freedom lives. Freedom is our ability to:
express without limits,
to seek truth and understanding,
to access the foods of our choice,
to choose what we allow into our bodies and our minds,
to grow our own foods and plant medicines,
to speak our truth,
to raise children without government interference,
to choose love instead of fear,
to choose healing over treatment,
to embody and integrate the Charters of Freedom,
to claim responsibility for individual choices, and the consequences of those choices.
How few of us have made our individual declaration of independence, and until we do that, we are not free.– Edwin Manners
The American Declaration of Independence reminds us,
When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature’s God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.
When governments ignore the will of the people and “go rogue” for the benefit of the few at the expense of the many, it is time to remember from where true freedom comes. Our system derives from our free will and consent.
The Polarity Principle
There are two belief systems representing the polarity existing on Planet Earth. Under the Polarity Principle everything has poles or pairs of opposite charge:
One belief system says that a human being is separate from all others, designed to control others when they cannot or do not reason for themselves. This belief derives from man-made written codes that must be learned.
Another belief system says that each human is a cell of the collective web, and that all humans are connected as one entity, one interconnected humanity. This belief derives from Natural Law. Natural Law is not written, but intuitive and knowable by simple observation, reason, common sense, and deduction. ‘By your action, ye shall be known.’
On a free-will planet, everything is presented as an offer to contract and it is always up to each of us to consent or to withdraw consent. Silence is acquiescence. Ignorance of the law is no excuse in the Age of Information.
Legal Vs. Lawful
There is a difference between legal and lawful. Legal pertains to the letter of law, whereas lawful pertains to the spirit of law. Legal matters reflect statutes between government entities and the color of law (i.e., the appearance or semblance, without the substance), whereas lawful matters reflect common law, the law of the land—the law of the people—and are actual in nature, not implied. Going forward, if we are to be free, we must resist playing a game of wits in a corrupt system that seeks to destroy Inherent Rights.
Instead, we must take back the language and determine who we are. Are we a “person-corporation” or a soul embodied? Do we have free-will or do we ask for permission from an outside authority? Do we consent to the dictates of a rogue government or do we withdraw consent? Do we own our bodies or does the State? Do we recognize inalienable rights and act on them? Do we reclaim our sovereignty as free-will beings? It is time to redefine the words we live by to work in our favor.
True Freedom for all should be seen as the goal of Spiritual development. Such a state can only manifest as a result of human society’s adherence to Natural Law. – Mark Passio, Natural Law, the Real Law of Attraction
Follow Intuition
As part of nature, we must connect to Nature to experience freedom. As Within So Without. When we follow government dictates as truth, we lose touch with our own intuition. We lose connection with our true nature. As long as we remain distracted, debating the details of the system (war, mandates, rigged elections, the NFL, science, abortion, self-identification), we are directionless, lost in a maze of confusion. By consenting to a system of contradictions through our participation and acceptance, the system feeds off our energy.
If America is held up as an example of Freedom to the rest of the world, we must get our act together and identify with Natural Law. Through the power of our vision we become the architect of the life we want to create for ourselves and for our families. We only need to reclaim responsibility and act on it in order to see it emanate out to affect all life. Such is the Law of Nature.
In the American system no government is sovereign. The peoples of the states are the sovereigns. It is they who apportion powers between themselves, their state governments, and the federal government. In doing so they are not impairing their sovereignty in any way. To the contrary, they are exercising it.” – Tom Woods, Tenth Amendment Center

3437,Doesn’t Pay to be Ordinary on Defense,"Doesn’t Pay to be Ordinary on Defense
% of readers think this story is Fact. Add your two cents.
(Before It's News)
One of the reasons yards allowed is such a misleading statistic is that defense lives on the variation of yardage to stop drives. Said otherwise, an offense can move the ball robotically up the field with average run or pass results each play. It’s the defense which requires substantial variation of result to stop drives, primarily in the form of turnovers, sacks, offensive penalties, and key incomplete passes.
So how did the Ravens fare in these categories versus the Jags:
— No turnovers
— No sacks
— The Jags committed 2 holding penalties which did not stall drives.
— They also had a holing flag and a false start on the same series of downs where they still managed to get a FG.
— While Bortles had 8 incomplete passes in the first half, only 1 stalled a drive resulting in a punt, and only 1 other was in the same set of downs that resulted in settling for a FG.
Take out the kneels and the fake punt and the Ravens allowed a solid 3.6 YPC and 5.5 yard per play on all competitive defensive snaps, but the Ravens defense failed in terms of the pressure required to make the high-variation plays.
Not Scheming for Pressure
Here are a few supporting details:
— Pees called for just 3 blitzes from off the line of scrimmage (Onwuasor, Mosley, Correa).
— The Ravens had only 1 blitz that was deceptive by my definition (the first pass of the game had Onwuasor’s blitz coupled with a stunt by Suggs).
— Bortles had ample time and space (ATS) on 15 of 24 plays in the first half.
— Of the 9 first-half drop backs which were not ATS, 5 were designed to have the ball out quickly and were not pressure generated by the pass rush.
If you’re reading this piece after a beating like the Ravens just took, you’ve seen me present this chart and supporting details many times before with a summary in words. I’ll tell you what…you caption this in 1 or 2 pithy sentences, put it in the comments, and I’ll make sure to mention the best ones on the podcast. To be clear, I’m not looking for “the pass rush sucked”, but something that provides a little more insight/explanation as to why.
Individual Notes by Positional Group
Defensive Line
The line was taxed heavily as the defense returned to many more 4-DB sets and 2.5 defensive linemen per play. That, coupled with the absence of Brandon Williams and injury to Urban left the Ravens shorthanded.
Willie Henry (40 snaps) made his NFL debut on defense. In addition to 4 run stuffs (gains of 3, 1, 1, 3), he lined up as a 1, 3, and 5 tech. He was flagged for encroachment, an ongoing concern after leading the team in penalties during the preseason. Willie didn’t generate any pressure in 18 pass snaps, but his play lends hope that the DL can hold up with the absence of Williams and Urban.
Carl Davis (42 snaps) had his play increased sharply. Similar to Henry, he had 3 run stuffs (1, -2, 0) and drew 1 flag. He also generated 1 pressure in 18 pass-rush snaps.
Michael Pierce (55 snaps) also was effective versus the run with 3 stuffs (2, 3, 2). The issue with run defense wasn’t in the middle as we’ll discuss. Michael had no pressure events in 27 pass rush snaps.
Brent Urban was lost for the season after 18 snaps. He had been the Ravens iron man so far this season and a good source of interior pass rush (1 PD vs. Jags). The Ravens have Bronson Kaufusi available as the most obvious 5-tech replacement for Urban, but I won’t be surprised if they activate both him and Chris Wormley vs. the Steelers if Williams must sit again. The combination of Wormley and Kaufusi give the option for fresh inside pass rushers in a game where the pressure must be effective.
Patrick Ricard (5 snaps on defense) played sparingly despite the scarcity of linemen. Of his snaps, 4 came in goal-line formations where the Ravens used all 4 available down linemen.
Linebackers
The Ravens activated all 8 of their linebackers (5 OLBs, 3 ILBs).
Here are the total snaps, pass snaps, and pressure events for each of the OLBs
This is the group that let the Ravens down most, especially considering the mediocre Jags OTs (Parnell, Robinson) who played the bulk of the snaps. In addition, all of the big runs allowed to RBs came on the edge.
Tyus Bowser (8 snaps) regressed badly after being named Defensive Rookie of the Week versus the Browns. He was the first to lose Marcedes Lewis in man coverage for a touchdown (Q1, 3:39) when he bit on the TE’s play-action chip block and did not follow his release until it was much too late. He lost the right edge to TE Koyack, which helped lead Fournette’s 15-yard run right (Q1, 5:00). He capped his day by losing the left edge to the FB Bohanon on Ivory’s 9-yard run left (Q3, 3:24). It was on that play that Mosley was visibly upset. Bowser was removed and did not return.
Kamalei Correa (22 snaps) had his best career game. His highlights:
— (Q1, 7:25): He pursued quickly to take down Fournette for a gain of 5 (2 + 3 YAC) between the numbers and right hash.
— (Q2, 2:16): He came on a well-timed blitz off the offensive left side to deliver an unblocked QH on Bortles, who grounded his screen pass.
— (Q4, 8:51): He had tight coverage of Bohanon by the right sideline and undercut the short route for a PD and near INT.
He appears to be taking a different stance, closer to the line of scrimmage than Mosley. Since I don’t see how that would help in coverage, I assume it’s a mechanism to get him to make a quicker impact on run plays.
Patrick Onwuasor (33 snaps) got the start. He finished with 7 tackles, including 3 run stuffs (1 an assist), which masked a mediocre day in coverage. In particular, he missed a tackle to allow 4 yards after contact by Lee (Q1, 2:05), appeared to lose coverage of Grant on his 18-yard reception (Q3, 13:43), and failed to cover Bohanon well on his 8-yard reception (1 + 7 YAC, Q3, 1:19) by the right sideline.
Secondary
Jimmy Smith (53 snaps) played well. He was beaten for a 13-yard completion by Cole (Q1, 4:23) despite outstanding coverage by the right sideline. He otherwise did not allow a reception to his assignment and registered 2 PDs, 1 on a big hit of Bohanon (Q3, 12:11).
Marlon Humphrey (21 snaps) extended his playing time and continued to produce at a high level. To summarize his highlights:
— (Q2, 5:04) He both stripped and forced out Lee in the right side of the end zone.
— (Q2, 2:13) He undercut Bortles’ 20-yard pass for Cole between the numbers and left hash for a PD and near INT, but the play was negated by Webb’s illegal contact flag across the field.
— (Q2, 1:25) He had close coverage, leapt to knock the ball away, and was called for a ticky-tack DPI versus Lee down the left sideline for 29 yards.
— (Q2, 0:46) He had tight coverage and was credited with a PD on a ball Cole lost off his fingertips. Smith had contact on this play that looked much more like pass interference than the previous play.
He again had the lowest yards per play of any Ravens defender (3.8), including a large personal contribution. For the season, the Ravens have allowed just 2.7 yards per play with him in and 5.8 yards per play with him on the sideline.
Tony Jefferson (61 snaps) didn’t impact the game as Ravens fans would have hoped, which is something that almost has to be true in a game where the opposing TE has 3 TD catches. Jefferson had excellent man coverage of Lewis in the back of the end zone (Q1, 10:33) as the defense stiffened to hold the Jags to their first FG. However, he was victimized in man coverage by Lewis, who split wide for his 3rd TD from an initial Jumbo set (Q3, 7:54). Bortles threw a simple jump ball (it wasn’t really a fade) to the 6’6” Lewis, against which Jefferson had good success in 2016.
In the interest of forgetting this debacle, we’ll dispense with the 3 defensive stars of the game.

2060,Hurricane Damage in Puerto Rico Leads to Fears of Drug Shortages Nationwide,"Thirteen of the drugs, Dr. Gottlieb said, are “sole-source,” meaning the product is made only by one company. Those include H.I.V. medications, injectable drugs and sophisticated medical devices, although he did not name the products. The biggest problem, he said, was not damage to the factories, but the instability of the electric supply. Manufacturers are worried that a long-term lack of connection to a major power grid could jeopardize their products, and are also wary of relying on the more limited electrical grids that the territory is likely to activate as a first step to restoring power.
One of the drugs F.D.A. officials said they were concerned about was methotrexate, which treats childhood leukemia and other diseases. It has been scarce, off and on, for several years. Mylan makes the product in Puerto Rico, and all five manufacturers of the injectable form of the drug have reported shortages of the product, according to a list maintained by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists.
In a statement, Mylan did not address the methotrexate shortage but said it was “working closely with F.D.A. to help address drug shortage concerns.” Its plant has sources of water, electricity and communication, and the company said it is “working on ways to make them sustainable for manufacturing purposes.” Like other companies, it said it was focusing on helping employees and other residents of the island with basic needs, including chartering a cargo plane carrying essential goods to deliver to them.
Several pharmaceutical and medical device companies said that their factories were coming back on line with the assistance of generators and that they did not anticipate supply shortfalls. But others said the situation was precarious. Drug companies depend on consistent refrigeration to avoid shortages. And device makers are wondering when the power grid would be back up, which some officials have predicted could take months.
“Everybody is struggling to get diesel fuel — that’s just widespread,” said Antonio Medina, an independent consultant who until last year was executive director of the Puerto Rico Industrial Development Company, a government-run group that promotes manufacturing.
Wilberto Maldonado, a pharmaceutical consultant in Puerto Rico, said drug and device makers were navigating a logistical “nightmare,” especially when trying to get access to fuel for their generators.
With phone lines down, “many employers have people still unaccounted for,” Mr. Maldonado said in a message through LinkedIn. “This may not improve, as telecom service providers are also depending on backup generators.”

Industry officials have sought to strike a delicate balance in making their case for help without appearing to divert precious resources from hospital and other emergency services. Returning the drug and device industry to its feet, however, is crucial for ensuring the island’s economic recovery as well as safeguarding the supply of medicines and devices to the rest of the United States.
If the manufacturing plants are slow to fully recover, some companies could shift their production elsewhere, said Deepak Lamba-Nieves, research director at the Center for a New Economy, a nonpartisan economic think tank in Puerto Rico. “That may have medium and long-term consequences for an island that is going to be hugely and severely impacted by this hurricane for many years to come,” he said.
Lobbyists and executives from health care companies met Tuesday with the Department of Health and Human Services and the Federal Emergency Management Agency to make their pitch for assistance.

AdvaMed, the trade group for the device makers, said its requests included priority access as the electricity grid is restored.
“Even if companies are fine now with diesel fuel, we want to make sure we’re in the queue in terms of priority,” said Greg Crist, a spokesman for AdvaMed. “Because if there is an electricity shortage well into November, for example, how can we as an industry make sure we are in line for those priorities, once you’ve taken care of hospitals and essential needs?”
While AdvaMed has outlined its members’ challenges, its pharmaceutical counterpart — the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America — provided fewer specifics and referred questions to Healthcare Ready, an industry group that is coordinating the recovery operations in Puerto Rico.

Several drug companies said that while their plants lost power and were forced to shut down, they were not anticipating a disruption in supply. “We have a strong local team working through incredible logistical challenges, and we’re seeing progress each day,” said Ernie Knewitz, a spokesman for Johnson & Johnson. Tylenol and Prezista, an H.I.V. drug, are among the products that the company manufactures in Puerto Rico. “We are also closely monitoring our product inventory levels and will work to ensure all critical needs are met.”
The industry’s rosy outlook, presumably offered in part to assure nervous shareholders, contrasted with the concern expressed by Dr. Gottlieb.
“We know that the grid is going to be unstable for a long period of time,” Dr. Gottlieb said. “The generators were never meant to operate for months and months on end.”

Erin Fox, a drug shortage expert at the University of Utah, said she and other hospital pharmacists were monitoring the situation, and were worried that the storm’s impact could exacerbate the United States’ already dire drug-shortage problem.
Ms. Fox said companies typically do not disclose where they manufacture their drugs because it is considered a trade secret. Several companies declined to list which products they made in Puerto Rico.
“Because we have no transparency around that,” she said, “it’s actually hard to know the true impact of this.”
Baxter, a medical-supply company, has said that it is limiting shipments of products made in Puerto Rico to conserve its supply, including small bags of dextrose and saline, which are used by hospitals to prepare medication. Hospitals will be limited to their typical monthly shipment to prevent some institutions from stockpiling the products.
Ms. Fox said hospitals rely on these small bags of saline solution to mix medicines for patients, and “an allocation doesn’t guarantee that you will get some.”
A few years ago, Baxter was at the center of a shortage of large saline bags that led to state and federal investigations into its business practices.
Baxter said that its three manufacturing sites in Puerto Rico sustained “some damage,” and that “limited production activities” had resumed at all of its plants.
Puerto Rico has been a hub of drug manufacturing for decades — companies were lured to the island because of tax breaks and its access to the United States market, along with skilled employees who worked for lower wages. About a decade ago, expiring tax incentives led to a wave of factory closings, stoking fears that the industry was in jeopardy.
Today, the drug and device industries remain a mainstay of the Puerto Rican economy. Pharmaceutical and medical manufacturing accounted for nearly three-quarters of Puerto Rico’s exports in 2016, of $14.5 billion, according to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.

“These are some of the best jobs,” Mr. Medina said.
Dr. Gottlieb hopes the companies stay there.
“A highly skilled, highly dedicated and highly productive Puerto Rican work force enables the success of the industry,” Dr. Gottlieb said. “If they decide to relocate after this disaster, it would jeopardize the island’s economic future.”",fake

Fool me once, shame on you.
That’s the mantra going forward with this Seminoles squad. Going 0-2 to start the season is, I imagine, not what Seminole nation was anticipating. Heck, I imagine most of College Football wasn’t anticipating this. Despite 2017 being a circumstantial season for the Noles (to say the least), the loss against NC State was simply inexcusable. Despite breaking in a true freshman in QB James Blackman, QB play wasn’t the reason why FSU lost the game. The penalties against Florida State, despite what some fans may think, isn’t the reason why we lost the game. FSU’s defensive performance, the squad that was to be key to Seminole victory at least early on in the season, was perhaps the critical component as to why FSU lost this home opener. The fact that NC State came prepared and fired-up shouldn’t come as a surprise, but the lackluster motivation/urgency on Defense falls squarely on both the players as well as the coaching. Despite some rust, two weeks of preparation and no games in between should of been plenty to prepare against a veteran and hungry Wolfpack.
Ranting over, FSU is just one loss in the ACC. FSU has the talent to beat every team on their schedule. Yes, this includes a surging Clemson squad. But they have two strikes, one loss anticipated, the other not so. Coaching must improve to salvage the season. But it should come as no surprise that FSU can still make the ACC Championship game. Alabama doesn’t count against them in conference, and NC State has a tough slate ahead of them. A loss is entirely possible for the Pack in ACC play. That being said, FSU must play error-free in conference to do so.
At this time, I do not have faith in this squad to do so. Most analysts that I trust that follow Florida State have them, at best, a 8-3 squad (remember, the game against UL Monroe was cancelled, meaning this is an 11 game season). This likely means a loss to Clemson at Clemson, SC. I, personally, am leaning towards FSU being somewhere between a 7-4 and, on my worst of days, even a 6-5 squad.
I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, as an alumnus, I am proud to call myself a Seminole, and am proud of this team regardless. But there is no doubting: Jimbo has a staffing problem that needs rectifying FAST. The message is being lost on the players, and this’ll impact recruiting if Jimbo doesn’t jump ahead of this at the end of the season and make some maneuvers with his staff.
That all being said: FSU and Jimbo can prove us all wrong with a statement win against Wake Forest at Wake Forest.
Wake Forest: 4-0 on the season so far
Wins against Presbyterian (51-7), Boston College (34-10), Utah State (46-10), App State (20-19)
Strengths: QB play, Defensive Line, Dave Clawson Coaching
Weaknesses: Talent vs FSU
The Line: FSU -7.5
Comments: FSU needs a desperate win, and a big one, for me to make any reconsideration on the outlook of the season. I think Dave Clawson is going to have the Deacon’s prepared to defend their home turf against the struggling Seminoles. Fool me once, shame on you. I’m giving FSU one last chance here. I think the talent that FSU has on the field, despite the preparations made by Wake Forest, will be overwhelming for the Deacons. Those four wins came against teams that Wake Forest should of beat. FSU’s losses are, given circumstances, entirely understandable (although not quite excusable). A loss here would be catastrophic for FSU, both for the season and beyond. I don’t see it happening with so much on the line. Wake Forest plays FSU close, and might even lead early on, but I think FSU breaks away by the second half. I think FSU covers the spread 27-14. FSU better cover the spread for the nation to have reconsidered outlooks on the program in Conference, let alone in the national landscape. Wake Forest, in recent history, has played FSU close. I imagine it will be the same in this edition. If Wake Forest breaks the line (or forbid me to say it, beat FSU), you can bet that I’ll lean my outlook on the season towards the 6-5 range (and at risk for a bowl berth).

3270,Automated farm in England grows barley crop,"(CNN) A farm in the United Kingdom is the first in the world to successfully plant, tend and harvest a crop without a single person ever setting foot in the field, according to researchers and developers involved in the project.
From sowing the seeds to picking the grain, human workers were replaced with automated machines operated from a control room. The project, called Hands Free Hectare, was completed last month with a yield of 4 1/2 tons of barley, according to news releases.
The automated farm was a joint venture by Harper Adams University in Shropshire, England, and Precision Decisions, a farming specialist company in York.
""Previously, people have automated sections of agricultural systems, but funding and interest generally only goes towards one single area,"" said Kit Franklin, an agricultural engineer on the project.
Experts agree that automation technology has been available for some time now, but in recent years its implementation has been accelerated by decreasing costs and changing demographics in the workforce.
An automated tractor worked in the barley field.
""The rising cost of labor is a huge driver in the field of agriculture technology,"" explained Matt Nielsen of Autonomous Solutions, a Utah-based company that converts vehicles from manual to robotic control. ""It makes sense when you compare the cost of technology to the cost of labor.""
Harbinger of what's possible
However, there are limitations still to be assessed. For example, fresh fruits and vegetables are more delicate than sturdy grains and may be more susceptible to bruising in a harvest void of human touch.
There are also social and country-specific considerations. In Japan, for instance, agricultural automation may be a necessity; in India, it could mean unemployment for millions.
""Technically, complete automation is feasible everywhere, but economically and socially it only makes sense in certain situations,"" said David Zilberman, a professor of agricultural and resource economics at the University of California, Berkeley.
Nonetheless, the complete mechanization accomplished in the UK is a harbinger of what's possible in agriculture production, according to experts.
At Hands Free Hectare, agronomists and engineers used customized tractors and drones to cultivate the barley from an area roughly equivalent to two and a half acres.
Drones with multispectral sensors took aerial images of the field, while smaller machines at crop level took samples to assess what fertilizers to apply and where. Live camera feeds were used to detect invasive weeds or disease.
Earlier this year, the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization stressed the need for technological innovation to create alternatives to high-input and destructive farming practices -- methods that are unsustainable to meet global food needs, the FAO warned.
Engineer Martin Abell monitors an automated spraying operation from the control room.
""Automation will facilitate a sustainable system,"" said Hands Free Hectare's Franklin. ""Different areas of the field, and possibly even individual plants can be treated separately.""
The success at Hands Free Hectare also demonstrates the economic feasibility of complete automation, researchers say.
The project was funded in part by Innovate UK, a government agency that helps British economic sectors transform from low-tech to high-tech. The whole enterprise cost around $250,000, Innovate UK said in a statement.
""The project itself was incredibly good value for money,"" said Martin Abell, a mechatronics researcher at Precision Decisions. ""This was only possible through the use of open-source software, allowing us to program our vehicles through low-cost drone-based autopilots.""
Skill set shift
Researchers maintain that even machinery produced commercially -- as opposed to the prototypes used at Hands Free Hectare -- would be priced comparatively to traditional agricultural equipment.
""Just as computers used to be expensive, the cost of automation technology is decreasing and won't be a barrier for even small farms,"" explained Michael Boehlje, a professor of agricultural economics at Purdue University.
Hands Free Hectare says the project is not about putting farmers out of work but instead modernizing their position.
""A change in skill set is inevitable,"" said Abell. ""Roles would transition, enabling the farmers to better use their time managing their farm and crops, opposed to carrying out the seemingly robotic task of driving up and down a field in a straight line.""
By leaving the ""robotic"" jobs to the robots, agriculturalists say farmers could create more efficient work-flows free of burdensome labor.
""A farmer once told me he adopted robotic farming systems so he could have a life,"" recalled Boehlje.
With the success of the summer harvest, Hands Free Hectare plans to continue its research into farming without any human tillage. At the end of October, the team plans to plant a full crop of winter wheat.
But first, they plan to celebrate their success -- by brewing their own beer, made from the spring barley harvested last month.",fake
2896,California Winds Are Fueling Fires. It May Be Getting Worse.,"Powerful, hot and dry winds like those that have fanned the deadly wildfires now raging in California are a common occurrence in the state, a result of regional atmospheric patterns that develop in the fall.
The impact of climate change on the winds is uncertain, although some scientists think that global warming may at least be making the winds drier. “That is a pretty key parameter for fire risk,” said Alex Hall, a climate researcher at the University of California, Los Angeles.

The winds, known as Diablo winds in Northern California and Santa Ana winds further south, have their origin in the high desert of the Great Basin of Nevada and parts of Utah. High-pressure air that builds over that region flows toward lower-pressure air over California and the coast.
Along the way the air descends to lower elevations, which causes it to compress and become hotter and drier. The air picks up speed as it descends and funnels through canyons or across peaks that are lower than their neighbors.
“The wind is seeking the path of least resistance to lower pressure,” Dr. Hall said. “That tends to be where there are gaps in the topography.”

The result is hot, dry winds with speeds that can exceed 70 miles per hour. In the wildfires that have devastated parts of Northern California’s wine country since Sunday night, the highest gusts were recorded in Sonoma County, at 79 m.p.h.

The state got some respite from the winds on Tuesday, but they were expected to pick up again Wednesday and Thursday. Scientists said such variation is typical, as there is natural variability to large-scale climate patterns like high-pressure systems. If the high pressure over the Great Basin moves eastward, for example, the air will be less likely to flow westward, and that may allow cooler, gentler winds to move into California from offshore.",fake
1430,"Formula 1: Lewis Hamilton, Mercedes and the 'fine art' of grand prix qualifying","Lewis Hamilton is closing in on his fourth F1 world title this year, after previous wins in 2008, 2014 and 2015
Listen again to a BBC Radio 5 live special - P1: Lewis, Mercedes and the Art of Qualifying
A record 71 pole positions and counting.
Of all Lewis Hamilton's many skills as a Formula 1 driver, this is one talent he has really made his own.
Race after race, Hamilton redefines the boundaries of the possible with those flat-out laps that decide the grid order - and quite often the race victory, too.
It is a moment when the essence of a grand prix weekend is distilled into 90 seconds of purity - the quickest cars on earth, and 20 men driving as fast as is humanly possible.
One man in particular.
""It's shorter,"" Hamilton says. ""It's intense. It's enthused with so much energy. The pressure is at the utmost. You go out, and you have that one lap to perfect and deliver. I love that challenge.
""It is the ultimate performance, putting all the pieces of the performance together and I have always loved that. That's when you attack. It's when you really go into battle. The car is light, it is the fastest you get to drive at any point in any weekend and it all comes down to that one moment and the decisions you make and I love it.""
In a sport where margins are measured to the thousandth of a second, Hamilton is frequently several tenths quicker than other drivers - even ones with the same car.
Ten poles in 16 races this season, a year when Mercedes have faced real opposition for the first time since 2014, tells its own story.
These are laps that make the jaw drop, that generate awe and admiration, even among his rivals.
But they are not just down to Hamilton alone.
A qualifying lap is the culmination of all the work an F1 team puts into the weekend, and the driver could not do it without the people behind him.
So how does Hamilton do it? BBC Sport took a deep dive behind the scenes at his Mercedes team to find out.
The talent
Hamilton describes himself as ""really just a small chink in the chain of a large number of people who make it possible"".
It is not false modesty - it's a statement of fact. But it is undeniable that it would not be possible without the ability of the man in the car.
Mercedes technical director James Allison has worked with all three of F1's current multiple world champions and describes Hamilton as ""a magnificently quick driver"".
For me, over one lap, I don't think there is anyone as quick as Lewis, and I don't think there ever has been Jenson Button Former McLaren team-mate
How quick? Well, in 10 years of F1 Hamilton has had five team-mates. In terms of championship points, Fernando Alonso has equalled him (in 2007), and Jenson Button (2011) and Nico Rosberg (2016) have narrowly beaten him in the title standings once, even if there were extenuating circumstances each time.
But in raw qualifying pace - taking an average of their speed over a season on quickest laps where a comparison is possible - no-one has ever been faster.
""In the races we could have some great battles,"" says Button, Hamilton's team-mate at McLaren between 2010 and 2012.
""He'd win a race, I'd win a race, and it was really close between us. But when it came to qualifying, it wasn't. He was just immense.""
The psychology
Talent on its own is not enough, though.
An F1 car is a complex object, and it needs to be fine-tuned to get the best out of it. And a driver is a human being, prone to distractions and weaknesses, which need to be eliminated for him to operate at his best.
Hamilton admits this has been a flaw in the past.
""It is definitely an area I really wanted to improve this year,"" he says. ""It has always been something I have enjoyed and generally excelled at. [But] it is all about the small percentages, and getting those extra little bits out of your own performances has really been my goal this year and I have managed to do that.
""You've seen how I live my life over the years and I really think the balance I allow myself to make is what enables me to perform the way I do.
""I arrive at the weekends in a positive frame of mind. I don't have any baggage. I generally don't give a you-know-what about what anyone says. I know my values, who I am and what I am about. I know what I am here to do, so I do it.
""I guess it is about building a force field against all the negativity that generally tries to penetrate. Nothing generally gets in and I know how to race and drive. It is about doing it.""
The change in 2017 has been noticed at Mercedes. Chief strategist James Vowles describes an upshift in Hamilton's ""attitude and approach to a race weekend"".
""There were times last year,"" Vowles says, ""where he would be on the back foot sometimes coming out of a Friday and it would take him time to build that confidence and ability back up as he went into the race and in the most extreme cases it would allow Nico to out-qualify him.
""He has aged a bit, he has become more mature with things. Things you know have failed you in the past, you fix them and improve them if you want to move forward as an elite athlete and that is what he is.
""So he has taken a reflection of what happened last year and improved on the small aspects things that he believes contributed perhaps to him not extracting everything in 2016. I am seeing a man who has changed and fixed those things and adapted. It is an impressive sight to see.""
The preparation
The general perception of Hamilton is of a mercurial character who relies on raw talent to make up for weaknesses in the more scientific side of the requirements of a grand prix driver. But the general perception is wrong.
Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff says: ""Lewis is a hard worker. He is very diligent in his approach and on a very steep development curve. He is someone who is never satisfied with his own performances and tries to better himself every day.
""He never settles. He is never happy with where he is as a racing driver and a human being. He wants to optimise, he wants to develop, and we have seen it very much in the team.
""He has become very much part of the leadership of the team. When times are difficult, he is calm and motivating the other members of the team but he is also capable of being very objective and natural about his and the team's performances and that made him become a strong pillar of the team.""
Vowles adds: ""Lewis this year has made another step as a driver. His approach to the weekends is a lot more scientific than I have seen from him before. He applies more science, more work, more practice. He is working much closer than I have seen him before with the team, because he knows everything matters in terms of the championship.
""That is not to say he wouldn't have done that in times of old. [But in] 2014, '15, '16 we had a car advantage and Lewis was a little more internalised; he didn't necessarily need to rally the troops as much as he is at the moment.
""This year, I have seen a new step from Lewis where he is able to properly exploit everything the team can provide him so they provide him everything he needs to be able to go and get pole position.
""It is no one element. It is not that he watches more videos or looks at more data or spends more time talking to the engineers. It is everything that he has improved by 1% that allows him to extract a lot more from the car.""
Hamilton says: ""Ultimately you've got these really intelligent individuals and it's about trying to make sure you get 100% out of each and every one of them. And they need to understand what they need to give you.
""If you don't give them the information of what you need, they can't guess. Building on our routine so they know exactly what they need to do to provide me with the platform I need to deliver what I deliver, for me to arrive into qualifying in that frame of mind I have. Collectively that's how we have the poles we have.""
The build-up
Hamilton is quick to praise his team in the good times - and offer sharp words in the bad. Here he shares the victory celebrations with Mercedes' Andrew Shovlin
The all-important laps in the the top 10 shoot-out at the end of qualifying - or Q3, as it is known - are just the climax of a long period of preparation.
It starts back in the factory, where engineers pore over data and try to give the team what they think will be the best baseline with which to start the car at a given track.
Through the three practice sessions, the team work with the driver to hone the car so he feels as comfortable and confident as he can taking it to the limit. And then comes the crucial hour on Saturday afternoon.
""Once you enter qualifying,"" Vowles says, ""you will notice quite a change of atmosphere in the team - doesn't matter whether it's Q1 or Q3, it is quite serious and orchestrated.""
The team have to negotiate their way through two knock-out sessions, making sure they judge the lap-time improvements of others correctly to avoid embarrassing early exits, making tyre choices and doing just enough running so the car, tyres and driver are in the best possible condition for the last 10 minutes when it really counts.
Given the complexity of modern F1 cars, with hybrid engines, energy regeneration, hundreds of settings and temperamental tyres, it is no easy matter.
""You need to make sure the driver has entirely bought into the psychology of what you are trying to do in qualifying,"" Vowles says. ""There is no point giving him a set of tyres and then saying off you go. You need him to be providing feedback.
""If you say we have a soft tyre, you need to work with him and say: 'What do you need to get a feel for the baseline? One lap, two laps, a push lap? How does the braking change when we change engine modes, is it significant enough that you need a little practice before Q3?'
""A lot of it is about getting the driver in the right mental state. The car performance is one aspect of things but you are asking drivers to find the absolute limit of their and the car's performance and to do that you need the driver in the right mindset and bought into what the team is doing as a programme.
""Over the recent years he has just got better and better by learning how to combine that enormous talent with the understanding of the technical side of the tyres and the power unit and the chassis and bringing it all together.""
The lap
A qualifying lap is a journey into the unknown. It is the fastest the car will ever go on that track, and by definition it is something the driver has never done before.
A driver is doing something most people have only a vague understanding of. He is trying to take the himself and the car to the very limits of possibility. It requires a combination of balance, bravery, feel, dexterity and commitment that is almost indescribable.
From the outside, on television, it might look relatively controlled, but that is the mastery of F1 drivers. In reality, the car is on the very edge at all times.
It is when you and your car come together and your art is really displayed. On that single lap, your artistry really comes out. Not many people talk about it as art, but it is a fine art Lewis Hamilton
It's not so much about not losing control - although that is the extreme of failure. It's more like a dance, although there is no easy metaphor.
At each corner, the driver must brake as late as he can without locking a wheel, enter as fast as possible without sliding too much - although the car is sliding all the time - get on the accelerator as early as he can without spinning the wheels too much.
All that while being subjected to extreme g-forces - up to 6G longitudinally during braking, well over 5G laterally in the fast corners.
Mercedes non-executive director Niki Lauda, a three-time F1 champion, says: ""A normal human being, they operate in a normal way. They say good morning, good evening. They have breakfast, lunch and dinner and they live their normal life. Sometimes more or less exciting.
""But when you are a racing driver and you have to deliver, that is a different ball game. Lewis can certainly deliver.
""It means he sits in his car and says: 'It is one lap now, I have to get pole position.' And he switches something on which very few people have, and this on-off from nothing to everything he is able to do in no time, and then he can squeeze out the last couple of tenths.
""Easy to do that when you push hard, then you make a little mistake, you go too far, you brake too late, you do all these kinds of mistakes. But on his laps he does no mistakes and drives the car right to the limit on every metre of the circuit. That makes him different.""
Even once out on track, the lap has to be prepared before it is driven.
Niki Lauda knows how hard it is to claim a pole position in F1. The three-time champion managed 24 of them in 171 races, a 14% strike rate. Hamilton's 71 poles have come in 204 races (34.8%)
Lauda adds: ""He sits in the car, get the right tyres on the car. You dive out of the pits, then you have a plan. How many corners, how quick to get these tyres to the peak point at the last corner before the lap starts?
""So he has to bring up the temperatures. If they are too high at the start he will lose out. So he needs to understand how closely to bring the grip level to the optimum.
""Then he has to go flat out, brake at the absolute best point without stopping a wheel, or coming off the line. Then he turns in and gets into the rhythm of what he can do. When he does the first corner well, the next corner comes easier, still going on the limit, over the kerbs, then he is in a normal rhythm to finish the lap. So if the tyres do not go weak in the lap, which can happen if he pushes too hard, then he has pole position.""
For Hamilton, this is the moment where all that preparation gives way to instinct and ability. Not for him techniques beloved of sports psychologists such as visualisation.
""I have never visualised a lap,"" he says. ""I tried it many years ago. For me personally, it is a complete waste of time. It did nothing for me.
""You can't predict what you are about to do. You can't put in your mind that you are going to turn at this point.
""It is the greatest thing about racing these cars, it's that it's all on the dime, it's all on the split second - how you react, about the snap overseer that comes. You can't predict that; you just have to be ready. It is about being on your toes and I love that. So many balls are coming from so many different directions.
""What I can definitely advise any kid that's out there trying to race, don't listen to people who tell you you need a mental coach or you need someone to help control your mind.
""You need to let it run wild and free and discover yourself. It is all about discovery. And only you can do it. No-one can tell you: 'Don't do that because I have done it before.' You have to experience it in order to learn and grow from it.""
What does he do that others don't?
Hamilton is just the sixth driver to hold the outright record for F1 pole positions, after Juan Manuel Fangio, Alberto Ascari, Jim Clark, Ayrton Senna and Michael Schumacher
Driving an F1 car is all about adaptation. The car is very rarely perfectly balanced. It will always have a handling characteristic that the driver would rather was not there - a slight lack of front grip (understeer), too much rear sliding (oversteer), whatever. What marks out the best drivers is their ability to adapt to those problems and deliver the very best anyway.
Button says: ""With the car, even if the balance wasn't quite there, Lewis was strong. He would drive the car from the rear. He didn't mind oversteer on entry, apex, exit. He was a little bit more ragged than my style, but it works.""
Vowles adds: ""Of all the drivers I've ever worked with, Lewis is the one who is able to quickly and dynamically react to a changing set of circumstances. That's one of the key reasons as to why he is so good in qualifying.
""You have echelons of drivers throughout the grid. You have the Alonsos, the Lewises and the Vettels of this world, who are at times in a league of their own. Until you have referenced them all together at the same time in the same car you will never be able to answer who is the best.
""I think Fernando is exceptional as well but there are times when he isn't extracting everything that car has to bring - at all. It is difficult to find your motivation perhaps when you are behind but with Lewis I don't ever see that lack of motivation. And again Sebastian there are times where he had a faster car and Lewis has managed to beat him. By milliseconds - but has managed to beat him.""
The impact
When Hamilton broke the all-time record for pole positions this year, one phrase kept coming up in responses from his fellow drivers: He deserves it.
They all know how good he is. They see that he is doing things that are special and unexpected, that he is getting speed out of the car that, for all their data and computer predictions, not even the team knew were there.
The most recent example was Malaysia two weeks ago. Mercedes had the third fastest car at Sepang, yet Hamilton somehow put it on pole. Team-mate Valtteri Bottas was fifth on the grid, 0.7secs behind.
You'd get to Q3, and even if his first run wasn't so good, he'd come out and he'd be 0.2secs in front and you'd go: 'I don't know where that came from' Jenson Button Former McLaren team-mate
""On all the statistics I had,"" Vowles says, ""we were not on pole that weekend. We had been off-set by 1.4 secs on Friday, by 0.6-0.7secs on Saturday morning. And there is nothing in any of those metrics that tell you: 'Yeah it will all be fine if you push a bit more and turn the power-unit up, pole will be yours.
""That's what I call exceeding expectations. I was ecstatic in Malaysia. I can't explain it any other way, because it is an achievement you know you've realised because you have a driver who is able to extract everything from the car at any one given time.""
For Vowles, though, that was not even Hamilton's best lap of the year.
""It was one that definitely blew me away but I don't think it was his best of 2017,"" he says. ""I would have to go back through my notes but there were others that I thought were a much better achievement overall.
""The way I define a best lap is not just where he finishes relative to the field, it's how clean it was, how he built up, did he make any mistakes, any small lock-ups, any small adjustments in the steering wheel.

1991,Fourth ex-governor from Mexico's PRI arrested on corruption charges,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - A former Mexican governor wanted on corruption charges was arrested on Friday, officials said, marking the fourth detention of an ex-governor from the country’s ruling party so far this year.
Eugenio Hernandez, who served as governor of the northern border state of Tamaulipas from 2005-2010, was arrested in the state capital of Ciudad Victoria. He is accused by both Mexican and U.S. authorities of embezzlement and money laundering.
Hernandez served as a member of President Enrique Pena Nieto’s Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, which for decades has been battered by corruption scandals.
Corruption promises to be one of the major issues in Mexico’s July 2018 presidential election, with public discontent widespread over a spate of conflict-of-interest rows that have dogged the Cabinet and Pena Nieto himself.
The rows could play into the hands of leftist presidential hopeful Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, a two-time runner-up who presents himself as an anti-corruption crusader and is the front-runner in the polls.
Prosecutors alleged that in 2007 Hernandez bought a state-owned 1,600-hectare property through an associate, allegedly paying 16 million pesos ($862,730) for the land despite an estimated value at the time of slightly more than 1 billion pesos.
The land was previously sold in 2002 to an associate of Tomas Yarrington, Hernandez’s predecessor as governor of Tamaulipas, for 14 million pesos, while at the time its value was pegged at 866 million pesos, the prosecutors said.
Hernandez and his lawyer could not immediately be contacted for a response and have not made a public statement.
Yarrington himself was arrested in April in Italy and has been charged in the United States for presumed ties to drug trafficking. He has not made a public statement since his arrest.
Two other former PRI governors were also arrested earlier this year.
In April, Javier Duarte of Veracruz state was arrested in Guatemala, accused of siphoning off millions of dollars from state coffers. He has denied any wrongdoing.
Meanwhile, Roberto Borge of Quintana Roo state was arrested in Panama in June just as he was about to board a flight to Paris. Mexican authorities have requested his extradition.
Borge is accused of illicit enrichment, embezzlement and abuse of public office. He has denied the allegations.

2477,Rugby League World Cup: Sam Tomkins not in England squad,"Sam Tomkins won the Man of Steel award in 2012
Rugby League World Cup on the BBC Venues: Australia, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea Dates: 27 October to 2 December Coverage: Watch live coverage and highlights on BBC TV, Connected TV, online & the BBC Sport app and listen to live commentary on BBC Radio 5 live.
Wigan's Sam Tomkins has missed out on a place in England's 24-man squad for the Rugby League World Cup in Australia, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea.
Castleford Tigers' Zak Hardaker, who like Tomkins could have played at full-back, is also not selected, after he tested positive for cocaine.
Warrington forward Ben Currie and St Helens prop Alex Walmsley - both of whom are uncapped - are called up.
Hooker James Roby returns after a two-year absence from the team.
Wigan loose forward Sean O'Loughlin captains a squad featuring seven NRL-based players, including South Sydney Rabbitohs duo Sam and Tom Burgess.
James Graham and Gareth Widdop of the St George Illawarra Dragons, Canberra Raiders pair Josh Hodgson and Elliott Whitehead, and Cronulla Sharks' Chris Heighington are also included.
England head coach Wayne Bennett said: ""The competitiveness of Super League and NRL, and knowing the goal of playing for your country in a World Cup, has made many raise their game and become better athletes.
""The England programme has been very active leading into this tournament and having the squad meet up on regular occasions - on and off the field - has put us in a positive place before everyone gets into camp.""
All of England's matches will be broadcast live on BBC TV, radio and online.
Analysis
BBC Sport rugby league correspondent Dave Woods:
The absence of Sam Tomkins may have surprised a few, especially given Zak Hardaker is not available, but looking at this squad, Wayne Bennett would seem to have pencilled in St Helens' Jonny Lomax as his first-choice full-back.
Tomkins hasn't done enough since his return from injury to convince the England selectors that he's ready for the international stage.
Bennett has gone for size in the outside backs. Mark Percival is named in the 24, but don't be surprised if Leeds powerhouse Kallum Watkins and Ben Currie - usually a forward - are the picks in the centres.
Currie has only played a couple of games at the back end of the season for Warrington after a lengthy lay off with an anterior cruciate ligament problem, and has yet to win an England cap, but his pace and power make him a potentially stand out player.
You can't argue with James Roby's return after a two-year international absence, because he's been as dynamic as ever for Saints this year. Roby and Josh Hodgson make a world-class pairing to chose from at hooker.
It will be interesting to see what Bennett's choice is in the halves, but a couple of weeks out from the tournament beginning, Gareth Widdop and Luke Gale would seem to be the pairing of choice.
But a tournament played over a six-week period should mean just about everybody in the squad gets a go as form fluctuates and injuries occur.
But compared to other squads and the settled nature of this English set-up going into RLWC 2017, they have a very good chance of reaching the final at least.
Full squad: John Bateman, Kevin Brown, Sam Burgess, Tom Burgess, Ben Currie, Luke Gale, James Graham, Ryan Hall, Chris Heighington, Chris Hill, Josh Hodgson, Jonny Lomax, Jermaine McGillvary, Mike McMeeken, Sean O'Loughlin, Mark Percival, Stefan Ratchford, James Roby, Scott Taylor, Alex Walmsley, Kallum Watkins, Elliott Whitehead, Gareth Widdop, George Williams.",fake
1087,Ravens Won’t Back Down,"Ravens Won’t Back Down
(Before It's News)
The Ravens are a mess. I’ve written about this before much to the chagrin of diehard fans. But sometimes the truth hurts and one look at Marty Mornhinweg’s anemic offense is all the reminder you’ll ever need.
Sure, injuries have played a role. How much better would the offense be if the Ravens had Marshal Yanda, Alex Lewis and Nico Siragusa across the offensive front? How much better might the running game be if Kenneth Dixon was available? How much better might the rapport be between new receiver Jeremy Maclin and Joe Flacco if the Ravens quarterback was available during training camp and the preseason?
Think of the defense with Tavon Young, Zach Orr and Brent Urban.
The losses have been brutal, but that’s life in the NFL. It is what it is and teams have no choice but to move forward and try to get better with each practice. It sounds cliché-ish, but really, what else can they do, quit four games into the season. John Harbaugh’s teams have been a lot of things since Super Bowl 47, many of them not so good. But one thing they’ve always been is gritty and resilient.
They won’t back down and possess a very solid, collective work ethic, one that Harbaugh hopes will propel improvement.
“We just have to improve. You’re not going to make a bunch of changes; you just have to improve. There were some flashes in there, and we have to build on those things. It’s a process. You have to go to work, and you work to improve. We have playmakers out there, and we can put the ball in peoples’ hands. We can run the ball – we’ve shown that. We have to eliminate the mistakes and make more plays.” ~ John Harbaugh
The good news for the Ravens is that they are only 1 game behind the Steelers in the AFCN, a team that really hasn’t been all that impressive nor has the rest of the league for that matter. Take a look around. The league is a mess!
The Chiefs sport the NFL’s best record with a perfect (4-0). They stand alone. Besides the Steelers, other division leaders include the Eagles, Lions, Panthers, Rams, Bills and Jaguars. None are without flaws. None are immune from injuries.
This week the Ravens travel to Oakland to take on a (2-2) Raiders team that will be without its quarterback, Derek Carr. Last season the Raiders were (12-3) with Carr, (0-2) without him. It’s a big loss.
What will be the Ravens record at the halfway point of the 2017 season 6-2 5-3 4-4 3-5 2-6 View Result Total votes: 0 6-2 (0 votes, 0%) 5-3 (0 votes, 0%) 4-4 (0 votes, 0%) 3-5 (0 votes, 0%) 2-6 (0 votes, 0%) Vote
Next week the Ravens return home to M&T Bank Stadium where they’ll host the Bears who announced that rookie signal caller Mitch Trubisky will be behind center. Under John Harbaugh the Ravens are (9-0) against first-year quarterbacks. After that it’s the Vikings on the road who will be without RB Dalvin Cook and possibly QB Sam Bradford. Then it’s home for Thursday Night Football against Jay Cutler and the Dolphins.
In a league where the only certain thing is uncertainty, these four games, despite the Ravens struggles, are all very winnable, assuming the Ravens make John Harbaugh’s hopes become a reality.

A Peruvian man was arrested for trying to smuggle over 6 pounds of cocaine inside the bellies of two St. Bernard dogs.
 
Local police say that the drugs were placed inside the dogs bodies during an operation that was performed inside a hotel room. Unfortunately, one of the dogs did not survive.
 
Police say the veterinarians removed bags of drugs from a male dog and a female dog.
 
They both suffered from grave peritonitis, an infection of the tissue lining of the abdomen’s inner wall. They both also experienced high fevers and vomiting.
 
The male dog, named Bomdon, died from the infection shortly after. Police say the man, Giuseppe Tombolan, 22, was arrested several weeks later.
 
Peruvian officials say this is the first time they had discovered somebody trying to smuggle drugs inside their dogs.

2650,Sources: Vegas killer paid cash for property and privacy,"Mesquite, Nevada (CNN) He seemed so ordinary, just another house-hunting retiree, when he strolled with his girlfriend into the sales office of the Sun City development in late 2014. The agents had just what Stephen Craig Paddock was looking for -- a 2,000-square-foot, two-bedroom stucco rambler on a cul-de-sac.
Other houses might offer bigger floor plans, but the one on Babbling Brook Court had two big selling points: a commanding hilltop view and, perhaps most importantly, privacy. Neighbors lived to the left and right, but none behind the home. Paddock quickly said he'd take it.
He stood about 6-foot-4 but came across as ""low key and relaxed, a good guy,"" one of the real estate agents recalled, speaking on condition of anonymity. Balding and paunchy, Paddock was the opposite of flashy. On his application, he said his income came from ""gambling."" He gambled about $1 million a year, he told one of the agents.
And he paid cash for the house, the agents said -- $369,022.
Soon, Paddock set about making alterations to his pumpkin-colored ranch. And his deep desire for privacy had the opposite effect: It drew the attention of neighbors.
Paddock erected a solid mesh privacy screen that blocked his neighbors' view of his home. About 20 of them signed a petition, and the homeowner's association ordered him to take it down, neighbors said. The HOA refused to comment.
Neighbor Scott Smith said he couldn't understand why anyone would want to obscure a gorgeous view of the town below. ""Why would you not have that lot for the view? Obviously, he wanted privacy.""
Another neighbor said Paddock told her, ""I don't want to be looking at people, and I don't want people looking at me.""
With the exception of that neighborhood squabble, Paddock appeared to be good at keeping a low profile. So good, in fact, he managed to assemble a sizable arsenal apparently without notice. And he carted at least 10 suitcases and 23 guns to the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino in Las Vegas last week without raising an eyebrow.
There, he executed a meticulous plan. The man who sought privacy and kept a low profile became the worst mass shooter in modern US history.
Stephen Paddock and his girlfriend, Marilou Danley.
As the police investigation enters another day, details are emerging about how Paddock -- a man with no criminal record or military experience -- carried out such an awful and bizarre mission. Investigators have yet to answer the most troubling question: Why?
Police and federal authorities say they found about four dozen firearms in three locations -- 23 in Paddock's hotel room, seven at a home in Reno and 19 at his house on the cul-de-sac in Mesquite. They also found ammonium nitrate, which is used in bombmaking, in his car and in Mesquite.
The woman he shared those homes with, Marilou Danley, was in the Philippines at the time of the massacre but returned to Los Angeles and met Wednesday with the FBI.
Afterward her lawyer read a statement from Danley. She said she was completely unaware of Paddock's deadly plan and is cooperating with investigators. She said Paddock found her a cheap plane ticket to visit family in the Philippines and confirmed that he wired her money to buy a house. Danley said she believed he was breaking up with her.
The couple's Mesquite real estate agent, meanwhile, finds it almost impossible to square the mild-mannered man to whom she sold a home with the now-notorious mass murderer. ""Trust me when I say there's a place in hell for this guy,"" she said.
Rarely seen
Window treatments at Paddock's house on Babbling Brook Court made it hard to see inside. His neighbor, Scott Smith, knew he was a gambler, and assumed he slept during the day.
Danley was pleasant, Smith said; Paddock, not so much. He wouldn't wave back. He seemed to have tunnel vision, to be in his own world.
Not that there was a lot of neighborly interaction. ""Garage is up. They're in the house. Garage is down. That was about it,"" Smith said.
The same appeared to be true in other places where Paddock had a house. Neighbors near his homes in Reno and Melbourne, Florida, said they rarely saw him.
Don Judy lived next door to Paddock in Florida. He said Paddock's house there was sparsely but tastefully furnished. Paddock rented a car every time he visited, about half a dozen times over two years, Judy and his wife told CNN.
Paddock didn't seem as interested in privacy as he'd been in Mesquite; he handed Judy a house key and told him he could borrow a ladder or lawn equipment if he kept an eye on the place. Paddock said he was a high roller and real estate speculator from Las Vegas. ""We're up all night because we gamble,"" Judy remembered him saying.
People who thought they knew Paddock said they were completely unaware of his gun collection. Authorities say he purchased 33 of his firearms, most of them rifles, over the past year.
Judy called him ""a gentle giant"" and said he had trouble even picturing him holding a gun.
Stephen Paddock's home in Mesquite, on October 3, after the Las Vegas massacre.
""If there was any impression, I would say the guy had no idea what a gun was,"" he said. ""He was very simplistic. If I could say, impression of it was 'gentle giant,' he just never showed any kind of aggression or anything.""
Location, location, location
Records show Paddock's knack for investing in real estate first developed when he was still a young man working as a postal worker. Besides the Nevada properties, records link him over the years to nine other houses, condos and apartment buildings.
While he took an $11,000 hit on the Florida house when he sold it, the records show Paddock bought and sold another property in Reno, two homes and an apartment complex in Mesquite, Texas, and at least four other properties in California. He profited handsomely from the sale of an apartment building he owned with a former wife and other family members. The building, purchased in 1992, sold for $3.2 million in 2004.
Eventually, around 2012, Paddock began spending more time in Reno, and sticking to his pattern, began buying property there. He also found a girlfriend. Although it is not yet clear how they met, Marilou Danley's job might have been the connection. An Australian citizen and former airline hostess and Avon sales representative, she worked for a time as a hostess to high-limit gamblers at Club Paradise at the Atlantis Casino Resort Spa.
Paddock's brother, Eric, has met Danley, and described the couple as devoted to each other. He told the Washington Post that Paddock once treated the whole family to a gambling vacation, taking over the penthouse floor at the Atlantis at the casino's expense.
He might have kept quiet about the guns, but he wasn't shy about the gambling.
""He gambled because it was fun,"" Eric Paddock told CNN. ""Because you're in a place where there's ringing bells and 'Surprise, surprise!' It was fun because people were nice to him. Girls brought him drinks. They served him big shrimp. I mean, he liked to gamble, and they put him up in crazy hotel rooms.""
A former bartender at Peggy Sue's restaurant recalled serving Paddock and his girlfriend in recent years.
""They were quiet. They just sat there by themselves,"" said the woman, who works in a different field now and asked that her name not be used.
She said there was one thing in particular she recalled in light of news reports that he was wealthy.
""He wasn't a heavy tipper,"" she said. ""I know that. That I would remember.""
Others who regularly dealt with Paddock and Danley saw a dark side.
A barista at a Starbucks at the Virgin River Casino in Mesquite told the Los Angeles Times that he rudely berated her in public. And, he glared at Danley when she asked to use his casino card to buy food or drinks.
""He would glare down at her and say, with a mean attitude, 'You don't need my casino card for this. I'm paying for your drink, just like I'm paying for you.'""
And yet, he seemed to have no qualms about using her casino card in his final days.
Leaked photos published by the Daily Mail show the scene, including what appears to be the shooter's body, inside Stephen Paddock's room at the Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas.
He reportedly used Danley's slot machine card to gamble at the Mandalay Bay's casino, according to Clark County Commission Chairman Steve Sisolak. It's not clear when he first showed up at the hotel, but he checked into the suite and an adjoining room on the 32nd floor on Thursday, September 28.
And then, shortly after 10 p.m. on Sunday, Paddock apparently swung a heavy hammer to smash out two windows, one in the room and the other in the suite. He opened fire on an unsuspecting crowd attending a country music festival 32 stories below. Round after round hailed down in rapid bursts for nine, 10, up to 11 minutes. It felt like an eternity.
The first frantic 911 call came at 10:05. When the guns fell silent at 10:19, 58 people were dead or dying and nearly 500 others were injured. Paddock peppered the door of his suite with gunfire to keep hotel security at bay, but saved the last bullet for himself.

1408,Researchers Connect a Human Mind to the Internet for the First Time Ever,"By Jake Anderson
Have you ever thought about whether future humans will live out aspects of their lives online in simulated environments, or even extend their natural lifespans by uploading their minds to a secure cloud ecosystem? It’s been a familiar idea in science fiction for decades. With news that Elon Musk was attempting to build a “neural lace,” the concept of a brain-machine interface (BMI) entered the public lexicon. Now, researchers at Wits University in Johannesburg, South Africa, claim to have linked a human mind to the Internet in real time — a biomedical first.
The project, dubbed the “Brainternet,” required the researchers to gather EEG brainwave signals using only an Emotiv EEG device and a simple Raspberry Pi computer. The experiment allowed the human brain to become an information node in the Internet of Things (IoT).
The experiment’s supervisor, Adam Pantanowitz, described it this way:
Brainternet is a new frontier in brain-computer interface systems. There is a lack of easily understood data about how a human brain works and processes information. Brainternet seeks to simplify a person’s understanding of their own brain and the brains of others. It does this through continuous monitoring of brain activity as well as enabling some interactivity.
Researchers say the project could provide valuable information for future deep learning algorithms and could even assist Musk’s endeavors in creating true BMI. Many futurists believe that as the impact and everyday importance of the Internet grows, it is inevitable that humans will merge the physical world with online virtual environments, ushering in a generation of enhanced augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and a synthesis of the two that some call Mixed Reality.
While the concept of “living” on the Internet may seem remote, we are in many ways already cyborgs dependent on the Web and artificial intelligence. Linking our brains to an online “hive mind” may ultimately prove to be the most efficient way humans can both receive and transmit information, though concerns over surveillance and privacy will likely follow us all the way through the century.

2121,Joe Biden writing foreword for transgender activist's memoir,"Former Vice President Joe Biden is writing the foreword to a memoir by transgender activist Sarah McBride, who made history when she addressed the Democratic National Convention last year.
McBride is now national press secretary for the Human Rights Campaign, a leading LGBT-rights organization. Her book, scheduled to be published in March by Crown Archetype, is titled ""Tomorrow Will Be Different: Love, Loss, and the Fight for Trans Equality.""
McBride, 27, first made headlines in 2012 when, at the end of her term as student body president at American University, she came out publicly as transgender in the student newspaper.
She went on to serve as an intern in the White House that year, the first openly transgender woman to do so. After graduating from college, she helped lead a successful effort to pass gender identity nondiscrimination protections in her home state of Delaware.
In 2016, she became the first openly transgender person to speak at one of the major political parties' national conventions.
During her White House internship, McBride met and fell in love with Andrew Cray, a transgender man and fellow activist. Cray was diagnosed with terminal cancer in 2014 and died just a few days after they married.
In her speech to the Democratic Convention, she evoked her love of Cray.
""Will we be a nation where there's only one way to love, one way to look, one way to live?"" she asked. ""Or will we be a nation where everyone has the freedom to live openly and equally?""
Biden, who represented Delaware in Congress for many years, writes in the draft version of his foreword that transgender equality is ""the civil rights issue of our time.""
""It's about freeing the soul of America from the constraints of bigotry, hate, and fear, and opening people's hearts and minds to what binds us all together,"" he writes. ""And that's what makes Sarah's book so powerful.""
McBride's political activism began as a high school student in Delaware. In 2010, she worked for the election campaign of Biden's son, Beau, when he was the state's attorney general. Beau Biden died in 2015.",fake

2018,'Dynasty' review: CW revival new bang for bucks,"(CNN) After extensive dabbling in the world of superheroes, the CW plunges back into the super-rich and super-soapy with ""Dynasty."" Seemingly determined to out-sleaze ""Gossip Girl,"" the catfight-heavy premiere largely delivers on that level, with the disclaimer that sustaining such serialized ""Can you top that?"" silliness is where the producers will have to earn their keep.
If TNT's ""Dallas"" revival built upon the original and its characters, ""Dynasty"" -- overseen by the producers of ""Gossip Girl"" -- has essentially borrowed the name of Aaron Spelling's original the-rich-are-like-us-only-crazier drama and spruced it up for modern times.
At the show's core there's still Blake Carrington (Grant Show) and his massive energy company and estate, which his ambitious, scheming daughter Fallon (Elizabeth Gillies) assumes is eventually going to be hers.
Those plans, alas, are thrown for a loop when Blake reveals that he's engaged to one of his employees, Cristal (Nathalie Kelley). Fallon dismisses her with a constant barrage of sniping, thus lending credence to Cristal's complaint that Blake's kids won't see her as anything more than ""the girl you're banging.""
There's a lot of banging and big bucks all around, naturally, with Fallon dallying with the family chauffeur (Robert Christopher Riley), and her brother Steven (James Mackay) -- among network TV's first gay characters on the original -- allowed to be himself more openly, while his promotion of environmental causes has created a rift with Blake.

2153,Report: Chicago Bulls working on an extension for Gar Forman,"Report: Chicago Bulls working on an extension for Gar Forman
(Before It's News)
The Chicago Bulls are right smack dab in the middle of a full rebuild after trading away superstar Jimmy Butler during the 2017 NBA Draft. Life has been rough for the organization the last 5 years or so. After Derrick Rose tore ligaments in his knee, he was never the same and the Bulls fell from the top of the Eastern Conference to the bottom where they currently sit. Instead of trying to get younger during the 2016 offseason, Gar Forman and John Paxson decided to bring in veterans Rajon Rondo and Dwyane Wade as a band-aid. It didn’t work. Frustrations toward this regime of Paxson and Forman have grown from fans and it’s really no secret. And now on Tuesday, news broke from 670 The Score’s Bernstein and Goff Show that the team is working on an extension for the General Manager Forman. Here’s what they tweeted out on Tuesday afternoon: https://twitter.com/Bernstein_Goff/status/915336688280489990 Click the tweet and see the reactions for yourself. Hint: It’s not good. For a team that went from the top seed in the 2010 Eastern Conference Playoffs to flat rock bottom this year, it’s mind-boggling that this regime is given another chance, yet, be considered for an extension. If Chicago’s young talent in Zach LaVine, Kris Dunn and Lauri Markkanen don’t show much promise this season, then things will get even worse in the organization. I think it’s a little too early to be thinking about an extension for either Paxson or Forman.

552,Trump's generals are speaking up,"(CNN) It's not organized military opposition to President Donald Trump. But day by day, generals and admirals are publicly stepping up and directly giving the American public their views in ways that don't always match the Twitter rhetoric of their commander in chief.
Nowhere was that made clearer than in the recent video of Air Force Academy superintendent Lt. Gen. Jay Silveria speaking to cadets after racist slurs were posted on message boards of five black cadet candidates at the Air Force Academy Preparatory School: ""If you can't treat someone with dignity and respect, then you need to get out. If you can't treat someone from another gender, whether that's a man or a woman, with dignity and respect, then you need to get out. If you demean someone in any way, then you need to get out. And if you can't treat someone from another race or a different color skin with dignity and respect, then you need to get out,"" the visibly furious general told his troops.
It's what happened next that gives pause. The video went viral. Social media filled up with messages from currently serving and retired officers applauding Silveria for showing unambiguous leadership especially in the wake of the racial violence in the Charlottesville.
One senior officer, who asked not to be identified posted on social media, ""Leaders own problems. I'd follow this leader anywhere, anytime.""
In Puerto Rico it's much the same, while Trump calls for local Puerto Ricans to do more, the three-star Army general in charge of military relief operations has another view.
Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Buchanan, within hours of arriving, said more help and more troops were needed: ""It's not enough and we're bringing more in,"" he said. More helicopters are now there to ferry aid to remote areas -- something local truckers cannot yet do. A three-star commander is on the front line of one of the worst natural disasters to hit millions of Americans, speaking bluntly off-the-cuff, without White House spin-meisters in control of his answers.
There were two more significant comments that underscore the difference in how some military commanders and the President are approaching the fundamental issue of leadership. In the wake of Charlottesville, the four-star heads of each military branch -- Navy, Army, Air Force and Marine Corps -- tweeted about their own zero tolerance for racism in the ranks. Privately they all indicated it had nothing to do with Trump's post-Charlottesville comments, but as members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, each of them knows the precise political environment in which they operate.
But then there was a very different tweet about Puerto Rico from Trump several days into the relief efforts. He tweeted: ""The Fake News Networks are working overtime in Puerto Rico doing their best to take the spirit away from our soldiers and first R's. Shame!""
Look past the slap at the media. This is the President of the United States openly suggesting the spirit of the American soldier, sailor, airman or Marine could be broken. No military officials I have spoken to in recent days can readily recall an instance of another president saying anything like this.
Even Gen. Joseph Dunford, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, who has been reticent to speak publicly, acknowledged to Congress he differed with the President on the proposed total ban on transgender persons serving in the military: ""I would just probably say that I believe any individual who meets the physical and mental standards and is worldwide deployable and is currently serving should be afforded the opportunity to continue to serve.""
Why is all this so important? This is no open revolt of the generals. In fact, many in the military support Trump because he gives top commanders more leeway to conduct operations.
And is this not exactly what we expect our senior military officials to do? Speak truth to power, which is not just the President but actually the American people? Until recent weeks, you haven't heard much publicly from military leaders. But that may be changing if these generals are a barometer.
Retired Col. Steve Warren, who served as a spokesman for Defense Secretary James Mattis, finally publicly decoded what has been happening in an interview on CNN's ""Reliable Sources."" It's much more than reporters saying they don't have access to information: ""The secretary of defense is in a very tight spot,"" Warren said. ""The President has declared that the press is the enemy of the people, but on the other hand I think Secretary Mattis understands the Pentagon is responsible for more than half a trillion dollars every year. There's a million American sons and daughters in harm's way.""
All of this boils down to one point: Mattis and his generals don't want to upset Trump. But reality is setting in and that environment might not last much longer.
Even Republican Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee Sen. John McCain, who is close to Mattis and Dunford, criticized the Pentagon's failure to inform Congress especially about the war in Afghanistan.
""We expect -- indeed, we require -- a regular flow of detailed information about this war,"" he said.
Nowhere is the potential harm of not speaking truth to power more dire than North Korea. The President recently tweeted he told Secretary of State Rex Tillerson ""that he is wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man... Save your energy Rex, we'll do what has to be done!""
The Pentagon has also strongly supported diplomatic action even as it plans for military action if needed. Top generals have consistently supported diplomatic efforts leading the way.
Mattis has insisted for months he has no differences with Trump: ""If I say six and the President says half a dozen, they're going to say I disagreed with him,"" he recently told reporters.
But even for Mattis, that may be a message point that is hard to stick to. He told Congress Tuesday he believes it's in the US national security interest to remain in the nuclear agreement with Iran. He also strongly endorsed Tillerson's efforts t o keep working on diplomatic solutions to the North Korea crisis.
There's no indication Mattis is on the outs with the President. And Congress understands, even if some don't agree, his political sensitivities when dealing with the Trump White House. But there is one problem: It is beginning to look like some generals plan to keep saying exactly what they think as they exercise the military leadership they believe is fundamental, and if that means contradicting the commander in chief, then so be it.
Lt. Gen. Vincent Stewart, one of the nation's most senior intelligence officers, made this sentiment clear in a speech Tuesday: ""Never forget who we serve. The Citizens of the United States.""",fake
130,Hungary’s “Wall” Versus the U.S. “Wall”,"Op-Ed by Catherine J. Frompovich
Currently in the European Union, there’s a huge “war of words,” including an action plan being implemented against what’s called the “Soros Plan” [4]. Soros like in George Soros [1, 2] who helped round up fellow Jews in his native Hungary during the Hitler/Nazi occupation and purges.
The prime “mover and shaker” against the Soros Plan is none other than the current Prime Minister of Hungary, Viktor Orban, who says “The whole of the European Union is in trouble because its leaders and bureaucrats adopt decisions like this,” e.g., Hungary’s being told to take in one million refugees a year whereas, in reality, Hungary actually built a wall to keep out immigrants. The wall has been 99% effective. That’s something not in the Soros Plan nor acceptable to some Eurocrats.
Source: Jack Montgomery ن Hungary builds a wall; cuts illegal immigration by over 99 per cent. Lessons for President Trump…? http://www.breitbart.com/london/2017/09/16/hungary-builds-a-wall-cuts-illegal-immigration-by-over-99-per-cent/ … [3]
Questions: Do readers know about the Hungarian wall? Have you seen mention of it in the USA media and press? Isn’t the Hungarian wall important news to be shared globally?
What’s the difference? Hungary actually built their wall; the USA has done nothing but squabble about building a wall, which probably could be as effective as Hungary’s wall. However, that would not fit in with the NWO’s “problem-reaction-solution” paradigm funded by NGOs like those Soros controls.
Prime Minister Orban states,
“The people support the ideal of the European Union. At the same time, they can’t stand the leadership of the EU, because it insults the Member-States with things like this, and it abuses its power. Everyone in Europe can see that. This is why the European leadership is not respected.” What they are occupying themselves with is attacking from behind those who are protecting Europe,” he [Orban] said frankly. “[O]ur soldiers and police officers stand fully-armed on the border, trying to apprehend, screen and eject from Europe people seeking to enter the continent illegally, and who may well be potential terrorists posing a threat to public security, human life and property.” “While we are doing this job, they sit in their comfortable offices and – as we say in Budapest – nit-pick in their pomp. Once again the European Union has clearly failed.” [3]
Does anything sound familiar in the sphere of New World Order geopolitics, including behind-the-scenes international political operatives, especially those who should be routed out and prosecuted for crimes against humanity (past and current) – similarly to what’s happening with the long-overdue media coverage Harvey Weinstein’s sexual abuses and scandals finally are getting as “their day in the spotlight” of shame and shunning after apparent years of cover-ups and payoffs? Silence is not golden when control freaks are on the prowl—really!
However, Hungary presented a draft law on NGOs, which aims to improve transparency among civil society groups, especially those receiving funds from outside Europe.
On the contrary, the Commission said, the draft law pursues a legitimate aim of improving transparency of NGOs. What’s more, it is legitimate for a state to monitor the main sponsors of NGOs and legitimate to publicly disclose the identity of the main sponsors. It’s also not only legitimate but “necessary in a democratic society” to require transparency of NGOs receiving funding from abroad in order to prevent them from being misused for foreign political goals. [5]
Apparently, transparency does not fit in with the NWO’s global governance agenda.
Bring on transparency laws everywhere, especially in the USA, I say.

98,Women Absorb And Retain DNA From Every Man They Have Sex With,"Women retain and carry living DNA from every man with whom they have sexual intercourse, according to a new study by the University of Seattle and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.
 
The study, which discovered the startling information by accident, was originally trying to determine if women who have been pregnant with a son might be more predisposed to certain neurological diseases that occur more frequently in males.
 
But as the scientists picked apart the female brain, the study began to veer wildly off course. As it turns out, the female brain is even more mysterious than we previously thought.
 
The study found that female brains often harbor “male microchimerism”, or in other words, the presence of male DNA that originated from another individual, and are genetically distinct from the cells that make up the rest of the woman.
 
 
According to the study: “63% of the females (37 of 59) tested harbored male microchimerism in the brain. Male microchimerism was present in multiple brain regions.”
 
 
 
So 63% of women carry male DNA cells that live in their brains. Obviously the researchers wanted to know where the male DNA came from.
 
 
 
Anyone care to guess? From the women’s fathers? No. Your father’s DNA combines with your mother’s to create your unique DNA. So where else could it come from?
 
 
 
Through the study the researchers assumed that the most likely answer was that all male DNA found living in the female brain came from a male pregnancy. That was the safe, politically correct assumption. But these researchers were living in denial.
 
Because when they autopsied the brains of women who had never even been pregnant, let alone with a male child, they STILL found male DNA cells prevalent in the female brain.
 
 
 
At this point the scientists didn’t know what the hell was going on. Confused, they did their best to hide the evidence until they could understand and explain it. They buried it in numerous sub studies and articles, but if you sift through them all you will find the damning statement, the one line that gives the game away and explains exactly where these male DNA cells come from.
 
What are they so afraid of?
 
 
 
“CONCLUSIONS: Male microchimerism was not infrequent in women without sons. Besides known pregnancies, other possible sources of male microchimerism include unrecognized spontaneous abortion, vanished male twin, an older brother transferred by the maternal circulation, or SEXUAL INTERCOURSE. Male microchimerism was significantly more frequent and levels were higher in women with induced abortion than in women with other pregnancy histories. Further studies are needed to determine specific origins of male microchimerism in women.“
 
 
 
So according to the scientists, the possible sources of the male DNA cells living in the women’s brains are:
 
 
an abortion the woman didn’t know about
 
a male twin that vanished
 
an older brother transferred by the maternal circulation
 
sexual intercourse
 
 
 
 
Considering the fact that 63% of women have male DNA cells residing in the recesses of their brain, which of the above possibilities do you think is the most likely origin of the male DNA?
 
 
 
The first three options apply to a very small percentage of women. They couldn’t possibly account for the 63% figure. The fourth option? It’s rather more common.
 
 
 
The answer is 4. Sex.
 
 
 
This has very important ramifications for women. Every male you absorb spermatazoa from becomes a living part of you for life. The women autopsied in this study were elderly. Some had been carrying the living male DNA inside them for well over 50 years.
 
Sperm is alive. It is living cells. When it is injected into you it swims and swims until it crashes headlong into a wall, and then it attaches and burrows into your flesh. If it’s in your mouth it swims and climbs into your nasal passages, inner ear, and behind your eyes. Then it digs in. It enters your blood stream and collects in your brain and spine.
 
 
 
Like something out of a scifi movie, it becomes a part of you and you can’t get rid of it.
 
 
 
We are only now beginning to understand the full power and ramifications of sexual intercourse.

444,Meet The Racist GOP Candidate On A ‘Special Assignment’ From Trump,Red Flag Warning: These California Wildfires Are ‘Among The Most Destructive Fire Events In US History’ And They Are About To Get Even Worse,credible
2471,'Stand for the anthem or don't play',"The owner of Dallas Cowboys has told his players they must stand for the national anthem.
""If there is anything that is disrespectful to the flag then we will not play,"" Jerry Jones said.
It follows US Vice President Mike Pence's decision to leave the game between San Francisco 49ers and Indianapolis Colts after several players refused to stand.
President Trump has tweeted his support for Jerry Jones.
Two weeks ago, Jerry Jones linked arms with his players and knelt before the anthem was played in the game against Arizona Cardinals.
It's after President Trump called on players to be sacked if they refused to stand for the national anthem.
The kneeling originally started as a protest over how black Americans are treated in society.
But it appears that Jerry Jones has now changed his mind. ""We cannot, in the NFL in any way, give the implication that we tolerate disrespecting the flag.""
The Cowboys' boss was one of the seven NFL owners to donate to Trump's inauguration.
There have been reports that other teams have told players they must stand.
The NFL Players Association defended players' right to protest. ""We should not stifle these discussions and cannot allow our rights to become subservient to the very opinions our Constitution protects.
""That is what makes us the land of the free and the home of the brave.""
Former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick was the first player to kneel during the national anthem.
It was in protest at the treatment of black Americans not the flag or the anthem itself.
He's not been offered a job since his contract with the 49ers came to an end in March.
On Sunday it was falsely reported that if he were given a job, he would stand for the national anthem.

173,New Oregon Law will Help Facilitate the Sale of Industrial Hemp Products,"By Michael Maharrey
Last Friday, an Oregon law went into effect that paves the way for the faster development of Oregon’s hemp market, and will further nullify federal prohibition in effect.
Sen. Ted Ferrioli (R-John Day) introduced Senate Bill 1015 (SB1015) last March. The new law gives the Oregon Liquor Control Commission authority over the processing of industrial hemp. Under this regulatory scheme, the state’s hemp business will be treated equally to the recreational cannabis industry.
According to Corvallis Advocate, this could open up new possibilities for the hemp industry, subject to certain limitations.
“Currently only registered hemp handlers can grow, process, and sell industrial hemp products in Oregon. According to Seattle’s CannaLaw group, a legal firm providing support to several pot businesses in the Northwest, SB 1015 would create industrial hemp licensing for individuals already working in the legal weed business so that regular cannabis processors, handlers, and retailers could start to process and sell goods made out of hemp. The biggest advantage of the new law would be that CBD-exclusive products like extracts could be sold in recreational dispensaries, thus lending even more of an edge to Oregon’s booming cannabis economy.”
A recreational marijuana producer will have to register with the OLCC before selling hemp products. The law will also expand some plant testing and record-keeping requirements.
Despite the additional requirements, the new law should serve to expand the hemp industry in Oregon.
SB1015 passed the House by a 45-0 vote. It passed the Senate 26-3. With Gov. Kate Brown’s signature, the law went into effect Oct. 6.
The Oregon legislature initially legalized industrial hemp production in 2009. When the Oregon Department of Agriculture finally put its licensing and regulatory program in place early in 2014, some farmers began growing hemp, despite high barriers to entry. Legislation passed in 2016 relaxed licensing requirements to encourage further development of a hemp market within the state. The new law already shows signs of delivering on promises to further open up hemp production and processing in the state.
The federal government still prohibits the cultivation of industrial hemp in most cases, and it prohibits the commercial cultivation of hemp in all cases. Despite federal prohibition, Oregon’s current law sets the foundation for people to nullify the ban by encouraging hemp production in the state. By relaxing regulations and facilitating further development of the hemp industry with this new law, Oregon will ultimately expand this “illegal” market.
The evolution of the hemp program in Oregon also demonstrates a practical reality. Tenth Amendment Center executive director Michael Boldin pointed out when states pass bills that remove a layer of law, markets will inevitably begin to develop.
As those markets take root, legislators start feeling the pressure to relax laws further,” he said. “Some critics complain that state licensing programs ‘restrict freedom.’ Still, state-restricted hemp farming is better than no hemp farming at all. That’s at least a little more freedom. And as we’re seeing in Oregon, it ultimately opens the door to even freer markets down the road. A little freedom begets more freedom.
FEDERAL FARM BILL
Early in 2014, President Barack Obama signed a new farm bill into law, which included a provision allowing a handful of states to begin limited research programs growing hemp. The “hemp amendment”
…allows State Agriculture Departments, colleges and universities to grow hemp, defined as the non-drug oil-seed and fiber varieties of Cannabis, for academic or agricultural research purposes, but it applies only to states where industrial hemp farming is already legal under state law.
In short, current federal law authorizes the farming of hemp – by research institutions, or within state pilot programs – for research only. Farming for commercial purposes by individuals and businesses remains prohibited. Oregon law ignores federal prohibition and authorizes commercial farming and production anyway.
OTHER STATES
By rejecting any need for federal approval, states like Oregon, and others including Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, California and Vermont, set the stage to nullify the federal hemp ban in practice by simply ignoring federal prohibition and legalizing industrial hemp production within their state borders.
While prospective hemp growers still have to take federal law into consideration, by eliminating the state requirement for federal permission, these states clear away a major obstacle to widespread commercial hemp farming within the borders of the state. As more people engage in hemp production and the market grows within these states, more people will become emboldened creating an exponential wave, ultimately nullifying the federal ban in effect.
HUGE MARKET FOR HEMP
According to a 2005 Congressional Research Service report, the U.S. is the only developed nation that hasn’t developed an industrial hemp crop for economic purposes.
Experts suggest that the U.S. market for hemp is around $600 million per year. They count as many as 25,000 uses for industrial hemp, including food, cosmetics, plastics and bio-fuel. The U.S. is currently the world’s #1 importer of hemp fiber for various products, with China and Canada acting as the top two exporters in the world.
During World War II, the United States military relied heavily on hemp products, which resulted in the famous campaign and government-produced film, Hemp for Victory!

3626,Democrats fighting losing battle on Tax Reform,"Democrats fighting losing battle on Tax Reform
(Before It's News)
CDN – http://www.conservativedailynews.com
By Rich Mitchell
President Donald Trump released his tax reform plan on Wednesday and Democrats are fighting it with losing talking points.
The plan eliminates state and local income tax deductions which Democrats complain will hurt high-middle income earners in their states. While their claim may be true for areas with exorbitant state and local taxes like New York, Connecticut, Washington D.C., and California, Republican Senators have no chance to win in an election in those regions and should ignore those concerns. If state taxes are so high that residents will find them objectionable once they are actually exposed to them, then voters may begin to understand that Democrats’ tax-and-spend ideology has failed them.
Rep. Steve King (D-NY) said that the deduction is “absolutely essential to my district,” adding that “I can’t vote for a bill that would eliminate the state and local tax deduction.”
“The public will be equally strong against this plan that is so perverse in helping the wealthy and hurting the middle class, and it will fail,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said Wednesday.
The state and local tax (SALT) deduction forces taxpayers in states with low or no state income taxes to subsidize residents who live in states that elect tax-loving liberals. Federal taxpayers in Alaska, Florida, Nevada, South Dakota, Texas, Washington, and Wyoming have to make up for the shortfall in government revenues that the deductions of New Yorkers and Californians cause. Why? Politics.
Local and state officials in liberal states have no qualms voting for additional taxes and increases to taxes knowing that taxpayers in other states will cushion the blow by subsidizing their residents’ hefty tax bills. As long as their constituents keep getting a free meal ticket from more fiscally responsible states, they know their seat is safe.
As we watch the Democrats march out a tidal wave of talking points about “boardroom and country clubs”, “wealth-fare”, “millionaires and billionaires” and Pelosi’s favorite hit on “trickle-down economics” realize that they aren’t really worried about the wealthy getting a tax break, which they won’t, liberals just can’t have their constituents realize just how bad they’ve been screwed.
The SALT deduction is nothing more than a redistribution of wealth. Not from the top to the bottom, but from responsible voters to those less so.

461,Week 5 Rankings (2017): Top 25 Quarterbacks: Newton/Wilson Return To Top 5 & More,"Week 5 Rankings (2017): Top 25 Quarterbacks: Newton/Wilson Return To Top 5 & More
(Before It's News)
by Eric Stashin (aka The Rotoprofessor)
We have our first week where we truly have to maneuver around bye weeks, and when coupled with a few injuries (Derek Carr and Marcus Mariota) Week 5 looks to be the most complicated we’ve had to date. Let’s try to sort through all of the questions as we breakdown our rankings for the coming week:
Tom Brady – New England Patriots – at Tampa Bay Aaron Rodgers – Green Bay Packers – at Dallas Russell Wilson – Seattle Seahawks – at Los Angeles Rams Jameis Winston – Tampa Bay Buccaneers – vs. New England Cam Newton – Carolina Panthers – at Detroit Carson Wentz – Philadelphia Eagles – vs. Arizona Matthew Stafford – Detroit Lions – vs. Carolina Dak Prescott – Dallas Cowboys – vs. Green Bay Carson Palmer – Arizona Cardinals – at Philadelphia Alex Smith – Kansas City Chiefs – at Houston Eli Manning – New York Giants – vs. Los Angeles Chargers Philip Rivers – Los Angeles Chargers – at New York Giants Deshaun Watson – Houston Texans – vs. Kansas City Jacoby Brissett – Indianapolis Colts – vs. San Francisco Josh McCown – New York Jets – at Cleveland Jay Cutler – Miami Dolphins – vs. Tennessee Tyrod Taylor – Buffalo Bills – at Cincinnati Marcus Mariota – Tennessee Titans – at Miami Ben Roethlisberger – Pittsburgh Steelers – vs. Jacksonville Andy Dalton – Cincinnati Bengals – vs. Buffalo Jared Goff – Los Angeles Rams – vs. Seattle Blake Bortles – Jacksonville Jaguars – at Pittsburgh Joe Flacco – Baltimore Ravens – at Oakland Deshone Kizer – Cleveland Browns – vs. New York Jets Brian Hoyer – San Francisco 49ers – at Indianapolis
Thoughts:
We saw Cam Newton’s 2017 breakout come in Week 4 against the New England Patriots, so you have to love the upside of Jameis Winston in Week 5. He has been impressive through his first three games, as he’s completing 63.0% of his passes (which would be his career best) to go along with 864 yards and 6 TD. He’s exceeded 325 yards in each of the past two weeks, and he could be looking at a third straight. Consider him a Top 5 option.
Speaking of Newton he threw for 316 yards, 3 TD and 1 INT in Week 4 and also rushed for another TD. The Detroit Lions do represent a bit of a tougher matchup (fourth fewest points per week to opposing quarterbacks), but that’s solely because they’ve given up little on the ground as well as limited opposing QB to 4 TD vs. 7 INT. They have allowed the ninth most passing yards (1,020) and Newton could easily help to drastically change their overall outlook. Consider him a viable QB1.
Deshaun Watson is coming off a big day, throwing for 283 yards, 4 TD and 1 INT (while also adding a rushing TD). He’s now thrown for 584 yards and 6 TD over the past two weeks, but a matchup with the Chiefs will not be an easy one. He’s more of a high-end QB2, as opposed to a trustworthy QB1.
It would be easy to get behind Ben Roethlisberger, but the Jaguars are allowing the fewest points per week to opposing quarterbacks. As the Jets helped to expose on Sunday where you can gash Jacksonville is on the ground, which points to another big day from Le’Veon Bell.
The change in offensive coordinator has obviously had a positive impact on Andy Dalton, who has now thrown for 6 TD vs. 0 INT over the past two weeks. The Bills represent a tough matchup, having allowed 1 TD vs. 6 INT and giving up the second fewest points per week to opposing quarterbacks. It’s easy to get excited, and there’s reason to believe, but he’s more of a QB2 for this one.

3436,Week 4 Rankings (2017): Top 20 Tight Ends: Does Anyone Want To Emerge As Trustworthy?,"Week 4 Rankings (2017): Top 20 Tight Ends: Does Anyone Want To Emerge As Trustworthy?
(Before It's News)
by Eric Stashin (aka The Rotoprofessor)
How many tight ends can we truly trust on a weekly basis? Whether it’s due to health issues or simply a lack of production, the position appears to consistently be in flux. It makes having those truly top options that much more valuable, as we cross our fingers and try to predict which tight end is going to produce and which will disappoint. Let’s take a look and see how the rankings currently stand for Week 4:
Rob Gronkowski – New England Patriots – vs. Carolina Zach Ertz – Philadelphia Eagles – at Los Angeles Chargers Travis Kelce – Kansas City Chiefs – vs. Washington Delanie Walker – Tennessee Titans – at Houston Jimmy Graham – Seattle Seahawks – vs. Indianapolis Jason Witten – Dallas Cowboys – vs. Los Angeles Rams Eric Ebron – Detroit Lions – at Minnesota Jordan Reed – Washington Redskins – at Kansas City Cameron Brate – Tampa Bay Buccaneers – vs. New York Giants Jack Doyle – Indianapolis Colts – at Seattle Kyle Rudolph – Minnesota Vikings – vs. Detroit Jared Cook – Oakland Raiders – at Denver Evan Engram – New York Giants – at Tampa Bay Charles Clay – Buffalo Bills – at Atlanta Martellus Bennett – Green Bay Packers – vs. Chicago Jesse James – Pittsburgh Steelers – at Baltimore Benjamin Watson – Baltimore Ravens – vs. Pittsburgh Coby Fleener – New Orleans Saints – at Miami Julius Thomas – Miami Dolphins – vs. New Orleans Hunter Henry – Los Angeles Chargers – vs. Philadelphia
Thoughts:
Zach Ertz has been targeted at least 8 times in each of the first three games, including 10 targets in each of the past two. We’ve long been waiting for the breakout to come, and finally we’re seeing it. He has 21 receptions for 245 yards and 1 TD and it’s only a matter of time before he finds the end zone a few more times. He’s going to be one of the elite each and every week.
The New York Giants have allowed 23 receptions and 3 TD to opposing tight ends over the first three weeks of the season. While Cameron Brate hasn’t done much thus far this season, this could be the week that he finally puts up some strong numbers. Consider him a viable TE1 in all formats.
After struggling over the first two weeks Jimmy Graham was one of the biggest benefactors of Russell Wilson’s breakout performance turning 11 targets into 7 receptions and 72 yards. With Doug Baldwin banged up there’s a good chance Graham posts another strong day.
The Baltimore Ravens watched Mercedes Lewis score three TD in Week 3, and we know Jesse James has the potential to find the end zone (2 TD in Week 1). It seems like the perfect opportunity for a sleeper to emerge, though he’s still a pretty big risk. Consider him high risk, but high reward.

2054,Emotional Night in Las Vegas Ends With a Golden Knights Win,"“It was probably one of the more emotional moments of my life,” Engelland said. “I probably don’t plan on scoring in too many games, but to get that one was pretty special.”
Marc-Andre Fleury made 31 saves for the Golden Knights, who became the first team in N.H.L. history to begin their debut season with three straight wins.
Just nine days after the massacre occurred less than a mile from T-Mobile Arena, the Golden Knights reverently honored the victims and heroes before the long-awaited home debut of the city’s first major professional sports franchise.
The Knights held a pre-game ceremony during which the names of the shooting victims were projected in gold onto the ice during 58 seconds of silence. Engelland spoke eloquently to the fans, vowing that the Golden Knights “will do everything we can to help you and our city heal. We are Vegas Strong.”
After that emotional outpouring, the Golden Knights charged into their home opener with some inspired hockey.

“We talked about tonight being the most important game we’ll ever play,” Vegas coach Gerard Gallant said. “A lot of guys, we’re playing for our city. We’re playing for the tragedy that happened, for all the people that were here tonight and affected by the tragedy. I thought our guys did a hell of a job. They came out and they focused on the game. They focused from the start.”
Nosek and Engelland connected in the opening minutes before Neal scored back-to-back goals in 4:27, giving him five goals in three games — and all three game-winning goals in team history. Vegas led 4-0 in less than 11 minutes, well on its way to a cathartic victory.
Oscar Lindberg scored in the second period for the Golden Knights, who opened their inaugural season with back-to-back road victories before returning home.

Tobias Rieder and Kevin Connauton scored for the Coyotes, who remained winless after losing back-to-back games to the expansion Golden Knights in a four-day stretch.
“That’s the one thing that disappointed me, that the effort by five or six guys at some points in the game wasn’t there,” Coyotes coach Rick Tocchet said. “Vegas deserved to win the game. It was a great program before the game. The organization did a nice job.”
The Golden Knights’ home opener was a bit more somber than the franchise originally planned, although the crowd was still whipped into a frenzy by the team’s excellent play. T-Mobile Arena had no ads on the boards around the ice for the opener. Instead, the all-white boards simply displayed the same message: “Vegas Strong.”
The crowd had scarcely quieted from the pregame festivities when Nosek, the Czech wing who spent the past two seasons with Detroit, fired a shot through Antti Raanta for a surprising goal.
Engelland, the veteran defenseman who has lived in Las Vegas since playing here for a minor league team several years ago, then took a pass from Brendan Leipsic and fired it through traffic.
Neal, who scored the first goal in franchise history, made it 3-0 just 6:15 into the first period and chased Raanta, who stopped only three shots. Neal added the first power-play goal in franchise history 4:27 later, setting off roars of excitement in T-Mobile Arena.",fake

2537,Mexico plans aid for Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria,"Sneakers hang from downed wires in the wake of Hurricane Maria in the Vietnam section of Guaynabo, Puerto Rico on October 1, 2017. REUTERS/Nick Brown
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Suffering itself after two major earthquakes last month, Mexico plans to send aid including water and electricity experts to Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory reeling from the devastation of Hurricane Maria.
The gesture, announced by the Mexican government on Wednesday, follows an awkward series of exchanges between Mexico and the United States over emergency aid in recent weeks.
Mexico plans to send some 30 tons of bottled water, mosquito repellent and specialists in power generation, transmission and distribution from the state power utility, Mexico’s foreign ministry said in a statement.
The Federal Electricity Commission (CFE) team would work to mitigate the damage and assist in restoring power supply after Maria, the ministry said.
The strongest hurricane to hit Puerto Rico in nearly 90 years, Maria caused at least 34 deaths and inflicted widespread damage to homes and infrastructure, including wiping out power across the Caribbean island.
Mexico has had strained relations with its northern neighbor since U.S. President Donald Trump took office in January, promising to build a wall along the U.S. southern border to keep out illegal immigrants and drugs.
Mexico had planned to send material assistance to the United States after Hurricane Harvey, which hit Texas in late August, but later withdrew the offer after the first of the two quakes struck southern Mexico in early September.
Trump was criticized in Mexico for the time he took to offer condolences to his Mexican counterpart, Enrique Pena Nieto, over the first quake, which killed at least 98 people. The U.S. president later said he had been unable to reach Pena Nieto because of poor cellphone reception.
Ironically, after Maria struck Puerto Rico, the local cellphone operator of Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim proved more reliable than some U.S. competitors during the early days of the communications outage across the island of 3.4 million people.

2241,The Pharmaceutical Menace Promoted As Prophylactic Medicine,"By Catherine J. Frompovich
The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) of the World Health Organization generated some information in 2014, subsequently republished online by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, which was titled “Disclosures of interests”—“Primary End-points for Prophylactic HPV Vaccine Trials.”
Several entries sort of “stand out” for various reasons:
Dr Douglas Lowy reports that as part of his United States government-supported research at the National Cancer Institute (NCI)/National Institutes of Health (NIH), he is an inventor of technology that underlies the L1-based prophylactic virus-like particle (VLP) HPV vaccine and technology that underlies an L2-based candidate prophylactic HPV vaccine. The NIH has licensed the technology for the L1 VLP vaccine to Merck, the manufacturer of Gardasil, to GlaxoSmithKline, the manufacturer of Cervarix, and to Indian Immunologicals Ltd. The L2-based vaccine technology is the subject of a cooperative research and development agreement between the NCI, Johns Hopkins University, and Shantha Biotech, and has been licensed to Shantha, PanVax, Acambis Inc., and GlaxoSmithKline. United States Federal law entitles Dr Lowy to a limited share of royalties the NIH receives for these technologies . Dr Joel Palefsky reports that his research unit at the University of California, San Francisco benefited from research funding from Merck and Hologic; Dr Palefsky reports that he benefited from support for travel from Merck; Dr Palefsky reports that he has received honoraria for a research presentation at Qiagen; Dr Palefsky reports that he testified on behalf of Merck on the vaccine efficacy in males. Dr John Schiller reports that as part of his United States government-supported research at the National Cancer Institute (NCI)/National Institutes of Health (NIH), he is an inventor of technology that underlies the L1-based prophylactic virus-like particle (VLP) HPV vaccine and technology that underlies an L2-based candidate prophylactic HPV vaccine. The NIH has licensed the technology for the L1 VLP vaccine to Merck, the manufacturer of Gardasil, to GlaxoSmithKline, the manufacturer of Cervarix, and to Indian Immunologicals Ltd. The L2-based vaccine technology is the subject of a cooperative research and development agreement between the NCI, Johns Hopkins University, and Shantha Biotech, and has been licensed to Shantha, PanVax, Acambis Inc., and GlaxoSmithKline. United States Federal law entitles Dr Schiller to a limited share of royalties the NIH receives for these technologies . Dr Margaret Stanley reports that she received personal consultancy fees from Sanofi Pasteur MSD, GlaxoSmithKline, and MSD ; Dr Stanley reports that she received personal speaker’s fees from MSD.
One has to wonder just how much the above “interests” can, and do, influence either the science or ‘propaganda’ generated by pharmaceutical companies in their zealous promotion of the very dangerous HPV vaccines being promoted for various ‘health reasons’ when first they were promoted as “preventing cervical cancer in young women.” Now boys, who don’t have cervixes, are mandated to receive them too.
The Australia Connection
In Australia there is a current ‘war of words’ going on regarding all mandatory vaccines, and in particular the HPV vaccine, between citizens and the Aussie government’s “No Jab No Pay” mandatory vaccine policy with groups like “No Jab No Pay No Way” stating:
NO WAY! – to pressuring or forcing injections that can cause serious medical conditions, even death! (Ab)using its power from needy families’ dependence, the Government threatens to withhold needed funds to PRESSURE OR FORCE 20 thousands of parents to allow their children to be directly injected and, by its own admission after only very limited testing3, with ALL of… 86 antigen doses: 8 injections (74 antigen doses) before 12 months of age, and 2 more injections by 4 years of age.4 plus foreign organism components, neurotoxins and multiple chemicals: such as aborted foetal & animal cell line components & DNA, aluminium, polysorbate 805, genetically engineered yeast, MSG, antibiotics and potentially animal viruses and/or other contaminants.6 Source
The factual irony of the “No Jab No Pay” policy is that it truly is unconstitutional in principle, as two countries now have stated mandatory and coercive vaccination policies (which Australia’s definitely is because government welfare benefits are attached) are unconstitutional. Those countries are Sweden in Europe and Colombia in South America.
As the “No Jab No Pay No Way” website clearly and legally asserts:
NO WAY! – to disregarding inalienable human rights!…. Individuals have inalienable rights to life, bodily security, equality, and free exercise of thought, conscience and religion. Provisions for these rights are NOT “loopholes”. They are expressed in the Constitution, common and statute law and international human rights instruments .19 Accordingly, the High Court (1949) has ruled that “any form” or “extent” of “compulsion” of medical services, “whether legal, by… penalties, or… by any other means, direct or indirect, could not be authorized .’20 So whatever ‘law’ the Government enacts, vaccination will remain illegal unless parents give valid consent . The Government itself instructs that consent to vaccination is valid only if given:- “voluntarily in the absence of undue pressure, coercion or manipulation” AND “after the potential risks and benefits of the… vaccine, risks of not having it and any alternative options have been explained” .21 Otherwise vaccination may constitute battery, negligence, malpractice, professional misconduct and/or fraud by the administrator . [CJF emphasis] Source
However, Australian health officials and all healthcare consumers there need to factor into the “No Jab No Pay” brouhaha going on, somethings that probably can influence changing the disregard for denying inalienable human rights: vested corporate interests and marketing plans on the part of vaccine manufacturers, their subsidized scientists and public relations mouthpieces, i.e., doctors Pharma financially support and provide gratuities to. In Australia one such individual, according to the IARC list, is
Dr Suzanne Garland reports that her unit at the Royal Women’s Hospital benefited from research funding from CSL, Merck, and GlaxoSmithKline; Dr Garland reports benefiting from personal speaker’s fees and support for travel from CSL, Merck, Sanofi Pasteur, and GlaxoSmithKline. [CJF emphasis]
Don’t CSL [1], Merck and GlaxoSmithKline provide HPV vaccines in Australia?
Is Australia so ‘hung up’ on pushing the HPV vaccines because it was “Australian research technology” and “CSL has the exclusive right to market in Australia and New Zealand any Merck HPV vaccine developed using CSL’s technology.” [1]
Here’s CSL (Australian Pharma Company) role in the HPV vaccine:
CSL chief scientific officer Andrew Cuthbertson said Merck expected to apply for a licence for the HPV vaccine in the second half of 2005, following extensive Phase III trials. “We’re very excited about this project, not just because we believe it is commercially important for CSL. “I think from an Australian science point of view, this is terribly important.” Dr Cuthbertson said CSL had not released any information in relation to milestone payments linked to the HPV vaccine or to potential royalties from sales. The vaccine could be on the market about 12 months after gaining regulatory approval. Dr Cuthbertson said Merck expected to be the first to sell the vaccine, under the trademark Gardasil, in the major markets of the United States and the European Union. The initial target group would be women aged 19 to 24, of which there were 60 to 70 million in the US and Europe. Merck was carrying out studies on vaccinating women aged 25 to 45, which comprised about 100 million women in the US and Europe, Dr Cuthbertson said. [1]
Now, let’s juxtapose the article “Ten years on, Professor Ian Frazer recalls ‘lucky’ discovery of cervical cancer vaccine” against the following devastating information about HPV vaccines adverse reactions from countries around the globe, which Australia and the USA both need to consider seriously and at least make HPV vaccines not mandatory, but voluntary. Voluntary status for those who either don’t know the real science behind the HPV vaccines or those who think HPV vaccines may be helpful truly IS the constitutional way to go, as opposed to the totalitarian way now being forced on adolescents and their parents.

Are prospective HPV vaccinees and/or their parents/guardians given and/or told, as part of “Informed Consent” and medical ethics, the above full-disclosure about the risks-benefits of HPV vaccines BEFORE inoculation?
NO! Why not? Shouldn’t that be legally mandated with vaccinees signatures giving consent required as part of vaccination protocols anywhere in the world, starting with Australia and the USA?
Another medical-legal protocol which must be instituted and enforced is this: When anyone under 21 years of age dies, a complete record of their vaccinations with DATES administered must become part of the autopsy report and medical review before issuance of a death certificate.

In January of 2016, the American College of Pediatricians issued the report “New Concerns about the Human Papillomavirus Vaccine” http://www.acpeds.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/1.26.16-New-Concerns-about-the-HPV-vaccine.pdf , which I encourage everyone to study.
FREE Stormproof, Waterproof Survival Match Kit (Ad) Nevertheless there are legitimate concerns that should be addressed: (1) long-term ovarian function was not assessed in either the original rat safety studies3,4 or in the human vaccine trials, (2) most primary care physicians are probably unaware of a possible association between HPV4 and POF [premature ovarian failure] and may not consider reporting POF cases or prolonged amenorrhea (missing menstrual periods) to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), (3) potential mechanisms of action have been postulated based on autoimmune associations with the aluminum adjuvant used1 and previously documented ovarian toxicity in rats from another component, polysorbate 80,2 and (4) since licensure of Gardasil® in 2006, there have been about 213 VAERS reports (per the publicly available CDC WONDER VAERS database) involving amenorrhea, POF or premature menopause, 88% of which have been associated with Gardasil.5 The twostrain HPV2, Cervarix TM, was licensed late in 2009 and accounts for 4.7 % of VAERS amenorrhea reports since 2006, and 8.5% of those reports from February 2010 through May 2015. This compares to the pre-HPV vaccine period from 1990 to 2006 during which no cases of POF or premature menopause and 32 cases of amenorrhea were reported to VAERS.
Dr. Sin Hang Lee, MD, Director of the Milford Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory, Milford, Connecticut, wrote a 16-page open-letter-of-complaint to Dr. Margaret Chan, Director-General of the World Health Organization, regarding misleading safety information about the two HPV vaccines, Gardasil® and Cervarix®, another important document to study.
Dr. Diane Harper, MD, one of the original researchers on the HPV vaccine spoke out and
…agrees with Merck and the CDC that Gardasil is safe for most girls and women. But she says the side effects reported so far call for more complete disclosure to patients. She says they should be told that protection from the vaccination might not last long enough to provide a cancer protection benefit , and that its risks – “small but real” – could occur more often than the cervical cancer itself would. “ Parents and women must know that deaths occurred . Not all deaths that have been reported were represented in Dr. Slade’s work, one-third of the death reports were unavailable to the CDC, leaving the parents of the deceased teenagers in despair that the CDC is ignoring the very rare but real occurrences that need not have happened if parents were given information stating that there are real, but small risks of death surrounding the administration of Gardasil.” She also worries that Merck’s aggressive marketing of the vaccine may have given women a false sense of security. [2] [CJF emphasis]
All the above about the HPV vaccines would lead any thinking person to wonder why such a ‘pig-in-a-poke’ is being mandated and forced on to adolescent children and their parents for compliance.
Is it a question of “follow the money”?

3167,Las Vegas shooting: Paddock may have planned to escape,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption 'It was the scariest moment in my life'
The gunman behind Sunday night's mass shooting in Las Vegas planned to flee, and he may have had help with planning the massacre, officials suspect.
Stephen Paddock was ""living a secret life, much of which would never be fully understood"", Sheriff Joe Lombardo told reporters.
The gunman's girlfriend said she had no idea what he was plotting.
Paddock's motive for killing 58 people in the largest mass shooting in modern US history remains a mystery.
Police found the 64-year-old former accountant dead in a room on the 32nd floor of a hotel after he sprayed bullets on concert-goers below, injuring hundreds.
He apparently turned one of his many guns on himself as police closed in.

In a press conference on Wednesday, Clark County Sheriff Lombardo was asked if he saw evidence that Paddock had planned to escape after the attack.
The sheriff said ""yes"". Asked what it was, he said: ""I can't tell you.""
Republicans open to ban on gun device
Sheriff Lombardo was asked by a reporter if he thought Paddock had carried out the attack alone.
""You've got to make the assumption he had to have some help at some point,"" the sheriff replied.
""Maybe he's a super guy, maybe he was working out all this on his own, but it would be hard for me to believe that.""
The possibility that Paddock could have had an accomplice is a twist in the investigation.
In the aftermath of the shooting officials described him as ""a lone wolf"" and said he was ""solely responsible for this heinous act"".
The FBI's Aaron Rouse said no link to terrorism had been found so far, but they would not discard the possibility.

'What goes on here, stays here'
Rajini Vaidyanathan, BBC News, Las Vegas
As traffic files past on a busy Thursday morning, a large purple billboard, advertising the Route 91 Harvest Festival, can be seen above.
Behind it, the stage with the lighting rig is also in view. The scene of Sunday's massacre appears almost untouched - as you gaze across the busy highway two broken windows on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Hotel break up the otherwise smooth gold facade of the building.
It is hard to even imagine how gunfire could have travelled so far - from such a great height and distance - on innocent concertgoers.
The hotel itself has reopened - a queue of people wait to check in at the marble counters, others sit at slot machines doing what people do best here.
Outside on the boulevard, a makeshift memorial is growing in size as people bring candles, flowers and photos, and write messages of love with chalk.
The motto of this city is ""What goes on here, stays here"" - that mantra rings true now. The tragedy of Sunday night will never be forgotten, but people are resilient, and determined to move on.
Police are investigating whether the mass murderer originally planned to targeted other music festivals.
Chicago police said they were looking into reports that Paddock booked a hotel room in August overlooking the Lollapalooza music festival in the Illinois city.
Former President Barack Obama's daughters were among the thousands of revellers.
It has also emerged that a week before his massacre, Paddock booked into a central Las Vegas apartment.
It was in a high-rise tower overlooking another open-air concert, Life is Beautiful, where acts included Muse, Lorde and Chance the Rapper.
The sheriff said more than 100 investigators had been combing through ""disturbed and dangerous"" Paddock's life.
Some 33 of the 47 weapons the suspect owned were bought in the past year.

Paddock - who was gambling just hours before he began shooting - had set up cameras both inside and outside the Mandalay Bay Hotel suite to see anyone approaching the room, police said.
Sheriff Lombardo added: ""Anything that would indicate this individual's trigger point and that would cause him to do such harm, we haven't understood it yet.""
What did Paddock's girlfriend say?
Marilou Danley, who was out of the country at the time of the shooting, has been described by US authorities as a ""person of interest"".
She voluntarily flew back to Los Angeles from the Philippines on Tuesday night to speak to the FBI.
Two weeks ago, she said Paddock surprised her with a plane ticket to visit her family in the South East Asian country.
Paddock ""never said anything to me or took any action"" which she understood as a warning of what was to come, she said in a statement read by her lawyer.
Ms Danley added: ""I loved him and hoped for a quiet future together."" ·
While she was in the Philippines, he wired her $100,000 (£75,400), saying it was to buy a house.
""I was grateful, but honestly I was worried it was a way for him to break up with me,"" she said.
""It never occurred to me in any way whatsoever that he was planning violence against anyone.""
Her sister earlier told Australian outlet 7News that Ms Danley ""was sent away... so that she will not be there to interfere with what he's planning"".
Paddock checked into a suite in the Mandalay Bay Hotel on 28 September, reportedly using some of Ms Danley's identity documents.

3370,Passing Game Film Review - McFrown - Week 4 (Jaguars),"Passing Game Film Review – McFrown – Week 4 (Jaguars)
(Before It's News)
The Jets won the game, but it wasn’t pretty. The Jaguars had plenty of opportunities to win the game, but Blake Bortles is a terrible QB, and the Jaguars have to be in the market for a good QB soon. Let’s look at some of the bad plays in the passing game.
1)
This play is a one outcome play, as the Jets have one route in mind and the rest of the team is tasked with blocking at first. The main purpose is to get the ball to Robby Anderson running down the field, and he is open for the pass. However, McCown doesn’t take the risk with the throw, instead choosing to run around the pocket until finding a safer option, which leads to a pass that nets negative yardage. This is probably one of the biggest issues with McCown, as he’s risk averse to a fault and doesn’t push the ball down the field when opportunities are present. The Jets caught the Jaguars in a bad defense for this deep route, yet still end up losing yards on this play.
2)
This is a third down pass that does not get a first down, because McCown makes the throw too early. The read on this play is the middle linebacker, especially since McCown has space inside the pocket to wait. When the tight end runs by the linebacker, that’s when the throw needs to be made, depending on the reaction of the linebacker. If the linebacker moves up for the running back, then the pass goes to an open tight end. If the linebacker follows the tight end backwards, there is more space for Kerley to run up the field. Instead, McCown pulls the trigger early, which allows the defense to collapse upon Kerley to prevent yards after the catch like a punt return.
3)
This play doesn’t count because there is a holding penalty on the Jets offensive line. However, note the risk aversion again from McCown. He has a wide open receiver running down the field and should be able to hit him for a sizable gain. However, McCown doesn’t pull the trigger and ends up running with the ball. This should have been a completed pass down the field. To hurt the cause more, the penalty happens after McCown decides to run, as the offensive lineman is trying to prevent the defensive lineman from running after McCown. Therefore, had he chosen to make the pass to the open receiver, the penalty would not have been called. This is a brutal miss by the Jets.
4)
The Jets are trying to rush down the field prior to the half to get some points, so some risk is warranted. However, McCown once again has a receiver running free down the field, and he decides to pass up on the option to get sacked. This should be an easy completion as soon as the receiver clears the linebacker in the middle, as you can see with him looking back towards the QB, expecting a pass. Another major missed opportunity by the Jets.
5)
The Jets are near the goal line and trying to score a TD, and McCown once again misses a wide open receiver. He makes a throw to a covered Jermaine Kearse, with Robby Anderson running free down the middle of the field. This is essentially a Fitzpatrick level pass because McCown focused in on Kearse from the start of the play and didn’t see Anderson at all. This could have been a touch down.
6)
This is a second and five play, and it almost goes for a pick six interception. The Jets have two safety options built into the route on either end to make easy completions. McCown does a good job of scanning the field, and finds Anderson open for the pass, but he can’t throw the ball with enough force and it’s almost intercepted. He doesn’t seem to see the safety in the middle at all, and it almost costs him. The decision is fine on this play, but he has to put more force behind this throw, or take the safety valve options because this is a fairly easy interception opportunity for the safety.
7)
On the outset, this is an unlucky interception. The pass most likely wouldn’t be intercepted if Bilal Powell doesn’t fall down. However, given the relatively clean pocket, this is another throw that is executed far too early. The Jets have a receiver cutting across the middle and Powell is the second tier option on the play. If the middle linebacker cuts towards Powell, then the receiver cutting across is open. If the middle linebacker goes with the receiver, then Powell will be building momentum with more space to run. Instead, McCown throws this pass early, which allows the middle linebacker to run towards the pass early, thus increasing the chance of Powell being stopped prior to the first down anyway. Since Powell falls down anyway, it’s a moot point, but this is also very bad execution on the part of McCown.
8)
Another Fitzpatrick level stare down of Jermaine Kearse, which almost leads to an interception.
9)
The Jets have a receiver going right down the field to the right side of the formation, with a defender trying to gain inside leverage, thus meaning a free release to the outside. Instead of taking a shot with the pass, McCown throws this pass up into double coverage to the other side of the field, with another pass that is lucky not to be intercepted. There isn’t much to be said about this, it’s just a bad decision.
10)
This is a play that has been analyzed over and over again. It’s pretty simple, McCown threw the pass early, which meant that Powell wasn’t ready for this pass, and it bounces away from him. The pass is a lateral, thus it counts as a fumble and it gets returned for a touchdown. The Jets are set up well to get some yards on this play with the screen pass, but McCown rushing it throws the entire play off.
Bonus:
1)
The play ends up being positive, but it seems like a very risky play with a low chance of a positive outcome. The game is tied, and the situation is 4th and 21, with 22 seconds remaining in the first half. The Jets need to execute a pass from a punter for 21 yards to have a chance for a possibly long field goal. An incomplete pass in this scenario would give good field position to the Jaguars with roughly 16 seconds remaining for a couple of quick plays. The throw is wobbly, and Marcus Williams makes a nice catch, runs around the defender, then runs into his own player, and somehow regains momentum to get the first down. The Jets of course seemed ill prepared for a positive outcome, as they promptly get a delay of game penalty and then miss the field goal. Most Jets fans probably don’t mind this call since the team is playing with house money, but this is a bad call for the situation. If there was more time to sustain a drive, or at least a couple of shots into the end zone, then it’s worth it. It worked out for the Jets but the distance and situation called for a safe punt.
Conclusion:
Josh McCown hadn’t won back to back games since 2004, a feat he accomplished with this win. Things that happened in 2004:
Britney Spears married Kevin Federline
The infamous Janet Jackson incident at the Super Bowl
FaceBook is launched
The last season of Friends
President Bush is re-elected
The Christmas tsunami
The Jets offensive system is actually encouraging because receivers are getting open, but the QB is missing them on a routine basis. McCown has a high completion percentage, mainly because he’s overly conservative with passes in critical situations.
Grade: C
If the Jets had faced a competent offense, this would have been a loss.

366,Passing Game Film Review - Good McCown - Week 4 (Jaguars),"Passing Game Film Review – Good McCown – Week 4 (Jaguars)
(Before It's News)
While the biggest controversy surrounding the NFL deals with kneeling for the national anthem, the Jets have flown under the radar as a surprise team with two wins, which is almost halfway to their season over/under lines. However, the Jets were lucky to win this game against the Jaguars, as Josh McCown played a mediocre game, and got plenty of help from the running game and Blake Bortles.
1)
This is a 3rd and 7 play in the first quarter, and Jeremy Kerley does a good job of clearing the first line marker as he runs his out route, and McCown throws a great pass. This is a good read because the defender on Kerley is positioned about seven yards off the line of scrimmage, and taking inside leverage, so there is a free release to the outside. This is a good route and good throw for the Jets.
2)
This play isn’t anything special in terms of McCown, it’s a simple check down screen pass to Elijah McGuire, who splits defenders to run down the field. His college tape indicated very good agility in short spaces and he definitely shows it on this play. The other thing to notice on this play is the outside routes to the left of the formation. The Jets are running two deep slant routes against a single high safety, and that is very important as the season goes on. This won’t be in effect as much with McCown as QB, but if Petty or Hackenberg take over as starter, this will be important. The dual slant in this scenario forces the deep safety to pick which corner back he wants to assist. For a risk taking, strong armed QB, the read would be to throw to the receiver that isn’t being double teamed. It doesn’t matter right now, but keep an eye out for this play if Petty ever starts a game.
3)
If you read last week’s column, you would be familiar with this play. It’s a tiered play, with a play action roll out to the right side of the formation. The Jaguars actually diffuse the roll out aspect of this play by penetrating the pocket, but McCown does a good job of hitting his first option in Austin Seferian-Jenkins. The play is designed to give multiple options as McCown rolls but he does well to improvise, given the defender in the pocket.
4)
Once again, a third down pass to Kerley. The Jets seem to fake a pick route, and go for a slant route to Kerley, and he gets to the marker. It’s a fairly simple play. This play is here for something that happens away from the pass. Notice Jermaine Kearse to the right side of the formation, put his defender on skates with his route running. This is a clinic on gaining leverage with route running skills. The defender is lined up in man coverage, and instead of giving away his route, he runs towards the defender and gives him a step the inside, which causes the hips of the defender to move. This slight move allows for a free release to the outside. The Jets did a great job of acquiring Kearse, because he may not always show up on the stat sheets, but he can definitely teach the young receivers on setting up defenders.
5)
3rd and short, and here comes a pick play, which seems to be a staple in the offense, and rightfully so. It’s a simple play, the outside receiver disrupts the defender enough to spring Bilal Powell free towards the sidelines and pick up enough yards for the first down. The Jets also run a mirror pick play to the other side of the formation as well, which essentially has two defenders slowing each other down. These plays are fairly common in football now because they are virtually impossible to stop without switching, much similar to screens in basketball.
6)
This is an excellent grab by Austin Seferian-Jenkins. He makes a beautiful catch from a decent throw by McCown. The ball is a bit high, but Jenkins high points the ball and makes a wonderful catch. This is however, the wrong decision, especially considering the Jets are driving down the field in a 2 minute drill. The Jets have Kearse on the outside with at least a step on his defender, with the safety too far away to impact the play. Given that the clock was under a minute, the right choice would have been to take the shot with Kearse. However, McCown still makes a good play, and Jenkins makes a great catch. This is another example of Kearse using good route running skills to set up a free release, as he is facing press man coverage at the line of scrimmage. He makes a subtle move to the outside, which turns the hips of the defender, and allows for a free release up the field. It’s quite impressive to see him set up routes consistently.
7)
Another pick play combination from the offense, this time setting up Robby Anderson. The play is simple, as we’ve seen many times already. The read on this play is a bit more complicated, if the defender stays close to Anderson, and cuts behind the Jets receiver setting the pick, then the QB leads Anderson to the inside to run forward. In this case, the defender runs around the receiver setting the pick on the front side, so the ball is thrown towards the outside so Anderson can turn around and get some yards.
8)
This is most likely the best pass of the game from McCown as he makes a perfect throw to Robby Anderson down the field. There isn’t much to talk about this play, it’s just a great throw. The late movement helps set up the defender, but Anderson does a great job of attacking the defender straight on at first, and then watch how he has a slight step to the inside before releasing outside. There are shades of Kearse’s route running abilities rubbing off there. Other point of note is the Kerley route, which is to occupy the attention of the single high safety long enough to allow Anderson to run deep.
9)
This play is from a different angle to show McGuire break the ankles of Dante Fowler Jr. on this play. It’s a simple screen pass to McGuire who absolutely burns Fowler on this play. There was a chance that McGuire would have broken the second tackle as well, but seemed to slip a bit with his foot. Just a great run by the rookie after the catch.
10)
This is a good read, but mediocre throw for the first down to Kearse. The ball is thrown behind the receiver, which prevents any chance of running after the catch. McCown has a clean pocket and should have been able to lead the receiver, but makes an inaccurate throw. However, the receiver still catches the ball and does get the first down.
11)
This play may not seem like much in the grand scheme of things, but it’s a very good play. The Jets are backed up near their end zone and need to get a manageable third down. As the announcers constantly mentioned, a penalty in the end zone would result in a safety and a loss. This is a simple route by Kearse, and the Jets have Anderson running behind him if Kearse is covered on this play. If the defender on Kearse is too close, then the passing lane to Anderson would be wide open. It didn’t matter much because they didn’t convert the short third down, but this is an important play in getting out of tight situations and bodes well for the offense in the future.
12)
There isn’t anything spectacular about this play, McCown goes through his progressions and hits Anderson for a nice gain.
13)
This play here is to praise Dante Fowler Jr. On the McGuire screen, he whiffed on the tackle, but he shows great hustle on this play. This is just a simple screen to Bilal Powell, but the Jets are set up extremely well down the field. If Fowler doesn’t chase down Powell, there is a decent chance that Powell breaks this pass down the field. The Jets have blockers set up down the field for a major gain on this play if Fowler doesn’t chase him down.
Bonus Play:
1)
I’ve inserted the running play here just to highlight Elijah McGuire. The Jaguars are lined up somewhat in a 4 wide stance, with the middle of the line being open against the Jets. Many teams employ this type of defense against the Jets, and the only real way to counter it is a running QB or a good running game. McGuire takes this hand off and hits the A gap, then runs around the safety for a touchdown. He shows extremely good vision, agility, and surprisingly sustains his speed down the field. He was chased down from behind quite a few times in college, which seemed to indicate a lack of high end top speed, but he maintains the distance between the defenders here for this long TD. It’s a very impressive run.
Conclusion:
The Jets won this game, but it wasn’t because Josh McCown was great. He did have his good plays, but he was helped immensely by the running game, and played a rather safe game again. His stats won’t look awful because he rarely takes risks, and the offensive system helps with easy reads, but the QB play needs to improve for the Jets to win more games.

On Sunday I was in attendance when the Ravens took on the Jaguars at Wembley Stadium. There was a buzz in the air – the excitement of taking in a game on foreign soil and meeting Europeans from all over the continent who had a rooting interest in the game.
It was different than any game I’ve ever experienced and as I stood for the playing of our national anthem, with my hat proudly fixed atop my heart, I hung on every syllable sung beautifully by Noah Stewart. My eyes glistened with tears of joy, the byproduct of pride for my country and the many blessings bestowed upon me by so many others who enabled this unforgettable moment.
I stared at the colors of our flag as it hung from the rafters of Wembley.
And I smiled.
But the smile didn’t last long.
Shortly after the playing of the UK’s national anthem, “God Save The Queen”, I started receiving text messages from friends back in the States who were outraged by several Ravens taking a knee during the playing of the Star-Spangled Banner, something I failed to notice from my seat.
The mood changed dramatically, and the Ravens did nothing on the field to reverse the rapidly sinking feeling. All that seemed so magical just moments before was gone with a communal bend of the knee.
The protests were heard loud and clear. The game suddenly seemed unimportant. The division of a nation took precedent.
We can rationally debate the merits of the protest, but we seemingly prefer to argue irrationally.
The purpose of any protest is to call attention to something that an individual or group takes exception to. To this extent, the protests across the NFL were successful. But once the attention is achieved and issue at hand is defined and brought to the forefront, the goal should be to resolve differences – to see something through the eyes of an adversary in order to realize an acceptable compromise that benefits all parties.
Unfortunately, at least for the moment, the protests have exacerbated the issues and the divisiveness is more pronounced. Both sides are throwing fuel on the fire, lost in the cause instead of defining solutions.
This is a time when leaders on both sides need to lead. They need to step up for the greater good and seek solutions, together. Stubbornness or escalation of commitment won’t get us there. Isn’t that already obvious?
Football is a game we all love. It’s a pastime – an opportunity to forget about the things that trouble us for 3 hours on a Sunday. It is an opportunity to come together as one for something that we, as a community, have in common.
I remember when the Ravens won Super Bowl XXXV and the celebrations that followed in Baltimore. “Our” team won and we rejoiced like nobody’s business – TOGETHER! It was reported that during that celebratory night on January 28, 2001 that only one arrest was made in the city of Baltimore. ONE! A misdemeanor.
That’s what sports teams can do. They can galvanize a community. And those teams are enabled by the freedoms we enjoy as American citizens – freedoms symbolized by our flag.
We’ve overcome bigger issues in the past.
Let’s not let foolish pride stand in our way.
Together we can fix this.
We owe that to those who sacrificed so much for their country.
Our country…

The issue is more sensitive, though, in soccer. As Qatar has waited for its Aspire graduates to fill its national team rosters, its soccer association for years relied on a controversial policy of naturalizations to fill the gaps. Even during this World Cup qualification cycle, Qatar’s roster included players born in Brazil, Uruguay, France and Guinea.

Jorge Fossati, a Uruguayan coach who took charge of the national team, threatened to quit last year after it was reported that Qatar’s soccer federation might consider phasing out naturalized players. (He stayed, then resigned suddenly six months later.) After Fossati’s departure, Qatar’s last two matches in World Cup qualification featured more native-born players; the team that played China in the final Russia 2018 qualification match last month contained eight Qataris who were born or raised in the country.

“Anyone who gets a Qatar passport, we’ll respect him,” Jassim said. “But we can talk about why are we taking players who are not quality? This is why the fans are angry.”
The Star
“They have talent, they are technical,” Xavi Hernández says of his Qatari teammates at Al Sadd, the Qatar Stars League club he has played for since 2015. “The big difference is, tactically, they don’t know how we attack, how we defend. That is the big difference. Conceptuality. On the field.”
Xavi’s presence here, too, is part of the broader Qatari soccer development plan. A World Cup champion with Spain and a Champions League winner with Barcelona, Xavi said he was ready to leave La Liga two years ago, feeling he could no longer play at the highest level. So he moved to Qatar, in part because of the money, but also to train as a coach.
Photo
But part of Xavi’s job, as an experienced professional with a glittering résumé, is to help promote Qatar 2022, and to nurture the next generation of domestic players.
“It is not easy because it is a very small country,” he said. “I think we have only 6,000 licensed players.” He singled out several with potential, including two Aspire graduates, Akram Afif and Ahmed Yasser, who now play in Europe. Each plays for a Qatari-controlled club, Afif at K.A.S. Eupen in Belgium and Yasser at Cultural Leonesa in Spain’s second division.
That, too, is part of Qatar’s long-range plan. Aspire bought the clubs as part of its strategy to set up a soccer pipeline that would include Qatari players, and expose the best of them to better competition, first at home and then abroad.
But that weekend, only a few hundred supporters turned up at Al Sadd’s Jassim Bin Hamad Stadium to see Xavi turn a match around. His two defense-splitting passes led to two goals, and to Al Sadd’s 2-1 victory over Al-Gharafa.",fake

BEIJING (Reuters) - Inside the packed exhibition hall in central Beijing is a showcase of China’s recent achievements: the country’s first operational aircraft carrier; a gleaming fleet of high-speed trains; happy villagers lifted from poverty.
While the display officially celebrates the accomplishments of the Chinese people over the past five years, it is made clear that President Xi Jinping is the man to thank.
To enter the exhibition, staged by the Communist Party’s propaganda department, visitors pass through a circular antechamber with red walls emblazoned with slogans inspired by Xi’s concepts on governance.
Hundreds of images of Xi adorn the walls in each of the exhibition’s ten halls: in combat fatigues surveying the troops, holding court with foreign dignitaries, even showing his softer side by petting a baby elephant.
By contrast, photographs of other party leaders are much smaller and displayed in less prominent spots.
Even a dinner receipt for 160 yuan ($24.25) bearing Xi’s name is on display, reflecting his frugality.
Alongside radio shows and documentaries lauding Xi’s achievements on state television, the exhibition is part of a propaganda push to bolster the stature of China’s leader ahead of a key Communist Party Congress on Oct 18.
At the conclave, which takes place every five years, Xi is expected to further cement his status as the country’s most powerful leader since Mao Zedong.
Although it is typical for the party to sell its key achievements ahead of major events, the propaganda effort is the most effusive for a Chinese leader in years.
Xi is being lionized as the one responsible for China’s recent successes, including an unswerving anti-corruption campaign, a buoyant economy and growing stature on the world stage.
The effort appears designed to justify Xi’s expanded powers, said Willy Lam, a professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. In recent years, Xi has stamped his personal leadership on reforms to the military, economy and cyberspace.
The Communist Party is trying to show that “only a strongman can marshal the forces and pull off these near-miraculous achievements which he is supposed to have achieved in the past five years,” Lam said.
The State Council Information Office, which also acts as the party spokesman’s office, did not respond to request for comment.
CULT OF PERSONALITY?
Chinese leaders do not make explicit appeals to the public for support, as, in theory, the Party confers the power of the people onto the leadership.

In reality, the images of top leaders are carefully cultivated by the Party’s propaganda arm.
An avuncular image of Xi during his early years in office, which led to a folksy nickname - “Xi Dada”, or “Uncle Xi” - and syrupy songs about his looks, was stamped out in early 2016 to avoid creating a cult of personality.
Kitschy souvenirs, like mugs and plates with images of Xi and his wife, the famous singer Peng Liyuan, have become harder to find.
Censorship of images that mock Xi, including an internet meme that plays on his supposed likeness to Winnie the Pooh, the cartoon character, has also tightened in recent months.
Still, personal touches have not completely disappeared from Xi’s carefully crafted public image.
Slideshow (10 Images)
On Sept 1, the 30-year anniversary of Xi and Peng’s marriage, a WeChat account posted an article of old photos and personal details about the couple.
A source with direct knowledge of the matter said the account was run by an official reporter who travels with Peng whenever she accompanies Xi overseas and is designed to share select details of the first couple’s life together.
DIGGING WELLS, TRANSCENDING THE WEST
For the most part, the latest wave of propaganda casts Xi as all business, focusing on his dedication, his aptitude and his personal role in guiding China into a new stage of development.
One documentary on state television applauded Xi’s prowess on the global stage. Foreign Minister Wang Yi published an essay in an official newspaper saying his contributions to diplomacy had transcended 300 years of western theory on foreign affairs.
A popular section of the Beijing exhibition is devoted to Xi’s pledge to transform China’s military into a world-class fighting force, including a display of model missile launchers, battleships and the Liaoning aircraft carrier, all under a giant red flag.
“It’s inspiring,” said one visitor, a retired automation engineer who only wanted to be identified by his surname, Ma. “The speed of China’s development has been very quick, and the ordinary people have benefited.”
A book on Xi, a 452-page collection of interviews of his years in rural Shaanxi province during the Cultural Revolution, has also been heavily promoted in recent months.
Some of the anecdotes are reminiscent of Party mythology about heroes who selflessly work for others - such as Lei Feng, an idealized soldier of the Mao Zedong era who was upheld as a model citizen after his death.
In the book, villagers who knew him say Xi showed signs of greatness even then, describing in one anecdote how he led villagers to dig a well so they had access to drinking water.
“It was icy cold to the bone but Jinping was down the well, his legs deep in the mud,” one villager, Liang Yuming, said. “He’d work for a long time, until he really couldn’t take it any more.”",fake
2034,PreaseasonBlackhawks vs Bruins1-0 Shutout Win Recap,"PreaseasonBlackhawks vs Bruins1-0 Shutout Win Recap
(Before It's News)
The Blackhawks preseason came to a close last night, at home, against the Boston Bruins. For those of you that spent your Saturday night at the United Center, I feel for you. It was a boring game. Most of the players seemed uninterested and most roster battles have been decided already. Since I wasn’t even supposed to recap this one, you’ll have to excuse the Cliff Notes version:
The Good
One player who was interested was Corey Crawford. He pitched in a 38 save shutout, and looked ready for the regular season. He was aggressive and square to the puck all night. I am sure that even in a shutout, the meatballs will find a way to complain about him.
The only goal of the game was a powerplay snipe by Patrick Sharp. Shades of the old sharpie at the left circle, before anyone knew just who Artemi Panarin was. Sharp had about 3 inches to score this goal and used every bit of that. For as much angst that the Sharp signing caused me on July 1st, seeing him out there and scoring gives me the chills. He may not be the Sharp of 2013-14, but the team seems to enjoy him being back.
Anton Khudobin was excellent for the Bruins. Any time you lose a game 1-0, it is not on the goalie. This game was a coin flip as to who was going to win.
The Blackhawks won an amazing 65% of their faceoffs, and they were 1-5 on the powerplay.
The Bad
Both Connor Murphy and Jonathan Toews left the game early with minor injuries. Quenneville said after the game that they “ Should be alright “.
“. No one really stood out. Not even “the amazing” Alex Debrincat. Jan Rutta continued to look good, but even he had some issues. Speaking of Debrincat, I said earlier that I understand them keeping him on the roster, but that doesn’t mean I think that he’s going to make it more than 10 games before he runs head first into the NHL wall.
The Ugly
The Bruins looked like they had tied the game almost midway through the third period, but Jake Debrusk interfered with Corey Crawford’s ability to make the stop and the goal was negated. Honestly, Crawford wasn’t making the save on the clean backdoor chance from Jakob Forsbacka Karlsson( say that name 5 times quickly ), anyway.
), anyway. I still see no redeeming qualities in Lance Bouma. He’s probably going to make the team over John Hayden, and that is a damn crime.
The Lineblender
Left Wing – Center – Right Wing
Brandon Saad – Jonathan Toews – Richard Panik
Patrick Sharp – Nick Schmaltz – Patrick Kane
Alex Debrincat – Artem Anisimov – Ryan Hartman
John Hayden – Tanner Kero – Lance Bouma Duncan Keith – Connor Murphy

2544,Wales consider possible Test selection change to 'Gatland's Law',"Media playback is not supported on this device Scrum V discusses the possibility of changing 'Gatland's Law'
The Welsh Rugby Union is considering changing its international selection policy, which could allow more senior players based abroad to play for Wales.
WRU policy permits only four players at clubs outside Wales to play for the national side for the next two seasons.
The quota is due to drop to just two wildcard picks for the 2019-20 season.
In Australia players who have won at least 60 Test caps and played domestic rugby for seven years can be selected regardless of any move abroad.
If Wales do adopt a revised senior player selection policy (SPSP), the number of caps and length of domestic service will not necessarily be the same as the Australia model.
Wales' current policy, also known as Gatland's Law in reference to Wales head coach Warren Gatland, is aimed at ensuring more players play their domestic rugby in Wales.
Taulupe Faletau, George North and Jamie Roberts could all be freely picked by Wales under an Australian model
The SPSP does not affect players who signed contracts with clubs outside Wales before the policy was introduced, such as Luke Charteris at Bath and Tomas Francis at Exeter.
Players who would benefit from such a Test selection change would include Northampton wing George North, who has won 69 caps, Bath back-row Taulupe Faletau (66) and Harlequins centre Jamie Roberts (93).
Should Wales set the bar at 50 caps, fly-half Dan Biggar (55) would also be eligible once he joins Northampton next season.",fake

3515,"The CDC’s Strange Case of Poul Thorsen, MD, PhD, Vaccine Data Manipulator “Extraordinaire”","By Catherine J. Frompovich
A few months ago after reading the book Master Manipulator, I wrote an article about Poul Thorsen, MD, PhD, the Danish medical researcher who produced the ‘premiere safety study’ that vaccines do not cause Autism; however, the study was produced fraudulently, but the CDC still promotes it and has not retracted it from vaccinology research, as science protocol requires.
One of the questionable studies involved is “A population-based study of measles, mumps, and rubella vaccination and autism” co-authored by Poul Thorsen, See comment in PubMed Commons below N Engl J Med. 2002 Nov 7;347(19):1477-82. It’s the study CDC particularly likes to point to regarding vaccines and Autism, and is published online here. The research was about ethylmercury in Thimerosal attributing to and/or causing Autism.
Poul Thorsen apparently was many things and probably even at cad, at that. He ingratiated himself both personally and professionally with CDC employee, Diana Schendel, PhD, who apparently was able to ‘guide’ his research around the CDC’s Atlanta headquarters.
When the CDC was notified by Thorsen’s Denmark colleagues about inaccuracies regarding CDC grants and funding, further investigation resulted “in 22 federal criminal counts – 13 counts of wire fraud and 9 counts of money laundering,” which never have been acted upon by the USA or CDC. Thorsen is hiding in plain sight, working and publishing articles in Denmark, with no extradition apparently requested by the CDC! How strange? “The United States has had an Extradition Treaty with Denmark since the Nixon Administration (1974).” (Pg. 4)
Enter into the story, Attorney Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has been investigating mercury in vaccines (ethylmercury in the preservative Thimerosal) and mercury elsewhere in the biosphere and medicine.
Mr. Kennedy founded the World Mercury Project, whose
…Mission of the World Mercury Project is to work aggressively to reduce exposure to all sources of mercury, hold accountable those who failed to protect our planet and people from these unnecessary exposures, restore health to those who have been harmed, and to establish necessary safeguards to prevent such tragedies from ever happening again.
Thimerosal is a vaccine preservative that still is in multi-dose flu vaccines and as a residual ingredient in vaccines, since during the manufacturing process, Thimerosal is used but then extracted. CDC and FDA admit there’s a residual amount in vaccines.
According to this CDC/FDA website:
For two childhood vaccines, thimerosal is used to prevent the growth of microbes during the manufacturing process. When thimerosal is used this way, it is removed later in the process. Only trace (very tiny) amounts remain. The only childhood vaccines today that have trace amounts of thimerosal are one DTaP and one DTaP-Hib combination vaccine.
Mr. Kennedy even went so far as to post a science challenge regarding thimerosal: Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Esq., offered a $100,000 reward to any journalist who “can find a peer-reviewed scientific study demonstrating that thimerosal is safe in the amounts contained in vaccines currently being administered to American children and pregnant women.” Kennedy now, however, is turning his attention to getting Poul Thorsen extradited to the USA to face legal charges. In order to explain the “Thorsen Saga,” Kennedy engaged Beth Clay to produce an update and report about Thorsen and his legal standing.
I’ve been in contact with Beth and obtained her permission to cite verbatim information she so eloquently put together and about which I thought readers ought to know. There needs to be a public outcry directed to Congress and the U.S. Attorney General to get the fictitious science surrounding Autism and vaccines mainstreamed as such, plus retracted by HHS/CDC/FDA and other nation states, including the World Health Organization. Beth’s outstanding report can be found here.
The report is 21 pages plus two pages of Exhibits. What I’d like to bring to readers’ attention are the following facts:
The U.S. CDC apparently sank $16Million into a vaccine investment fraud in Denmark!
Thorsen, apparently from the very beginning of his CDC ‘stint’, had designs of grandeur and lived high off the hog, while raising flags with his expensive Harley Davidson and suburban Atlanta home. In Clay’s paper we find,
CDC-Danish Coverup of Ethics Violations: The next day, the beginning of an ethical crisis began to take shape. Coleen Boyle, Marshalyn Yeargin-Allsopp and Diana Schendel participated in a Denmark Grantees Autism/CP conference call. Poul Thorsen participated and presumably helped bring the two new principal investigators up to speed. He was asked to provide Aarhus University a copy of all permissions in his files ASAP. Coleen commented that from what they had discussed, most of the activities were completed. Diana began discussing additional projects. Soren raised the issue of bringing the CP biomarker data to Aarhus for safekeeping. Then, there was a discussion about who had the various data and whether it could be gathered and secured all in one place. Diana and Poul were asked to provide historical context to this. Marshalyn asked if Aarhus could work with the Danish Psychiatric Data on the autism project. Poul stated this was the registry based data on vaccines. He stated that permission should already be in place. (However, it would be confirmed later that no permissions were in place and that Thorsen had never applied for them.) [Pp. 18-19] [CJF emphasis]
Not only were the above lack of permissions going on, Clay says,
Marshalyn had more questions. She verified that there was no medical abstraction of the autism perinatal records. Carsten had not found original approvals and was looking to Poul to provide them. Carsten believed they did not have permissions for the autism disorder case control study. Poul suggested checking with Kristine. (Exhibit 40) On the 30th of November 2009, Coleen Boyle, Diana Schendel, Marshalyn Yeargin-Allsopp colluded with Danish grantees to cover up a serious ethical violation in already published and about to be published research. They sought to cover their tracks on their failure to ensure Poul Thorsen had obtained all the needed ethical approvals for the autism bio and genetic studies. Two studies were published in which legally required ethical permissions were apparently never applied for and granted according to their notes. When repeatedly asked to provide them, Thorsen did not. In what are completely unethical acts by all involved, the team members went into damage control mode and decided that they likely could obtain permission for ongoing and future studies. They concluded that it would probably be impossible to get permission for research that was already finalized (and published). It is absurd that experienced federal grants management officials even discussed the idea of seeking a human subject safety review retroactively. These reviews, known as Institutional Review Boards (IRB) in the United States and Ethical Committees in Denmark are required before a study is initiated in order to protect patients and patient records from abuse. It would seem from the outset that the CDC was incompetent or inept in the management of this project. They also failed to do a site visit for the first three years. [CJF emphasis]
Collusion on the part of yet other CDC employees to commit fraud
How many times do we have to learn about a criminal collusion culture existing at the CDC/FDA before Congress, or whoever has proper oversight since Congress seems out-to-lunch, does anything to stop vaccine fraud?
Beth Clay ‘punctuates’ an apparent “Peter Principle” [2] promotion scheme within the CDC culture:
The Peter Principle is an observation that the tendency in most organizational hierarchies, such as that of a corporation, is for every employee to rise in the hierarchy through promotion until they reach the levels of their respective incompetence. [CJF emphasis]
Look what happened to Dr. Coleen Boyle!
Dr. Coleen Boyle, who has since been promoted to be Director of NCBDDD at CDC should have shut this grant down immediately upon being informed that ethical clearances were not in place. She should have immediately contacted the Office of Research Integrity, potentially even the Office of Inspector General. Funding should have been discontinued. She should have led the charge to have these papers retracted. There should have been, at a minimum, a press release from the CDC to inform the public. Instead, Dr. Boyle along with Dr. Marshalyn Yeargin-Allsopp, Joanne Wojcik and Dr. Diana Schendel colluded with their Danish Grantees to ‘fix it’ and retrospectively apply ethics approvals. Their next call on 14 December 2009 closed the case on Poul providing information to Aarhus. Joanne and Diana determined to go back through older grant applications to search for permissions.
Not only is this an egregious cover up, but it also points to poor grant management by CDC staff. The CDC staff responsible for this multimillion dollar grant, starting with Diana Schendel, should have had copies of all the legally required ethics permissions in hand before the Danish grantees were allowed to get started and before the first US taxpayer dollar was sent to Denmark. [CJF emphasis]
The Clay update on Thorsen is worth reading to understand how ‘legal sleight of hand’ goes on in federal bureaucracies and agencies where unelected bureaucrats apparently become ingrained and accepted culture ‘denizens’, knowing the CDC ‘has their backs’ (a la William Thompson, PhD’s whistleblowing [3]) and they will not be held accountable.
Well, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. apparently thinks differently and has shifted his attention to getting Poul Thorsen extradited to the U.S. to “face the music” and “pay the piper” for misappropriating between One and Two Million Dollars in CDC grant money.
However, who will make whole ASD children and their families as a result of Thorsen’s and other CDC researchers’ fraudulent work stating no association between Autism and vaccines, when in fact, there IS?

1424,"A Eugene O’Neill Marathon: 1 Actor, 1 Script, 5 Hours","Mr. Greenspan is also no stranger to lengthy events, having starred as Mephistopheles in Target Margin’s six-hour “Faust.” Yet “Strange Interlude” is something else entirely. As Jonathan Kalb, a professor at Hunter College who has written a book on marathon performances, put it: “Most solo shows, the better ones, are 90 minutes tops. More than that, boy, you’re risking everything.”
Photo
This “Strange Interlude” won’t be the longest straight play staged in New York in recent years — that honor belongs to Elevator Repair Service’s eight-hour “Gatz.” It’s certainly not the longest solo, clocking in at only a quarter of the length of Taylor Mac’s “A 24-Decade History of Popular Music.” But it is an occasionally lurid interwar ragout of sex, death and boat races. It is also probably one of the last times anyone decided to name a dashing romantic swain Gordon. Censored in New York and banned in Boston, the play nevertheless became an unlikely Broadway hit.
O’Neill joked that if the play were a sandwich it would be “a four-decker with nothing but ham.”
Mr. Greenspan has been chewing on that for a while now. In the summer of 2013, he, Transport Group’s artistic director, Jack Cummings III, its dramaturge Krista Corcoran Williams and a couple of associates met for an artistic residency in upstate New York. They’d all enjoyed working together on “The Patsy.” Now they wanted a project “to go deeper and further with,” Ms. Williams said.
So Mr. Greenspan read “Strange Interlude” aloud, which took him seven or eight hours. And the company agreed to produce it. Mr. Greenspan has been rehearsing ever since.
The published script runs 190 pages. Mr. Greenspan worked through the acts one at a time, putting in four to five hours a day, five to six days a week even while rehearsing, performing and touring other plays. Last year, Mr. Cummings gave him a cameo in his William Inge double-bill just to keep Mr. Greenspan around and on salary while he worked. This summer, while appearing in “Minor Character” in Connecticut, he requested a rehearsal space as part of his contract. “I had to memorize Act 8,” he said.
Mostly, Mr. Greenspan works at home, in the small one-bedroom in Westbeth Artists Housing that he shares with his partner, the teacher and painter William Kennon. He moves their furniture around to replicate the set and takes breathers to feed their two cats and one German Shepherd. Sometimes he borrows Mr. Kennon’s painting studio.

On a good five-hour day, he can learn perhaps two pages. But often it’s less. “Line by line,” he said. “Sometimes you learn just a few words, sometimes a sentence. It’s very deliberate.” Ms. Williams, who has often observed him, described the process as “mind-numbing and thrilling in kind of equal measure.”
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Mr. Greenspan prizes accuracy. In rehearsal he scolded himself for missing “and” in one sentence, “the” in another. But for him, memorizing means more than rote learning or brute-force drills. It means discovering in each line “what the intentions are, what the feeling is, what the state of being is, what the emotional state is,” he said.
He tries to make his characters as full and real as possible, figuring out how they move, how they think, how they sound. From there he develops a map of each act, “like making up a dance in a way,” he said, a dance he then fine-tunes with Mr. Cummings and his team.
Sitting in the rehearsal room, he cycled though some of this choreography. He stuffed his hands into his pockets for Ned, then gave his neck a sensual stroke as Ned’s lover, Nina, then knit his fingers as Nina’s forbidding father, Professor Leeds. Each character was conjured with what looked like minimal effort and eerie, easy grace. Then Mr. Greenspan stood and played the bit where Ned hands the prescription to Sam. One man moved to offer it; another snatched it away. The effect was delightful, and also unnerving.
Ms. Williams said that watching the full production can feel “like you’re either on drugs or experiencing some kind of religious reckoning.”
“There is something that happens when you’re in the room that long with one person doing something this audacious,” she continued.
For Mr. Greenspan, the effects are mellower. When he finishes a run-through he feels “good afterward,” he said, “neither tired or exhilarated.” And if there is lingering excitement “a little herbal tea will, I think, handle that.”",fake

2536,"Hit by a drunken driver at 17, she gives other amputees hope","San Antonio (CNN) On a spring day in 1990, Mona Patel was walking to class at Cal Poly University when a drunken driver slammed into her. She was 17.
""I flew up about 12 feet,"" Patel said. ""And then he pinned me between his car and a metal railing, and that's what smashed my leg and my foot.""
Patel's body, and future, were forever altered.
Weeks later, when Patel got out of the ICU, she underwent her first amputation. It was the start of seven years' worth of surgeries in attempts to salvage the rest of her leg.
Patel went on to earn a bachelor's and two master's degrees, and became a social worker.
But along the way, as Patel continued to struggle physically with her disability, she also struggled to find a support group for amputees. In 1997, with the prospect of another amputation, Patel made a promise.
""I vowed that once I got back on my feet, I would start one,"" she said.
Today, Patel's nonprofit, the San Antonio Amputee Foundation, aims to help amputees rebuild their lives. The group offers peer support, education and recreation opportunities, as well as financial assistance for basic home and car modifications and prosthetic limbs.
Every month, 30 to 60 amputees get together to shares stories and testimonies of strength and resilience. Patel estimates more than 1,100 amputees have attended the meetings.
SAAF helps with prosthetic costs
""When somebody becomes an amputee, maneuvering through the system is sometimes just scary,"" said Patel, a below-knee amputee. ""I think the big catalyst of me doing what I do to help the amputee community is because I lived it.""
Patel also leads health and fitness programs and sponsors amputees to participate in tennis tournaments and endurance climbs. In 2015, led by Patel, a group of amputees climbed to the peak of Mt. Kilimanjaro in Tanzania.
CNN's Allie Torgan spoke with Patel about her work. Below is an edited version of their conversation.
CNN: What was it that inspired you to help others going through similar struggles?
Mona Patel: Getting the news that you're going to have to face an amputation is overwhelming. It's scary. The questions are numerous. In 1997, I was getting ready for surgery number 21. I was already married by that time, and I thought to myself, ""I don't have children yet. If I elect to have my leg amputated, how difficult is pregnancy going to be? How difficult is it going to be to care for my newborns?""
I found a woman who was an above-the-knee amputee and had four children after her amputation, and she said that ""I did everything on my one leg."" At her bedside, she had a little crib, a rocking chair, a refrigerator and a bottle warmer. And that is all I needed to hear. She put so much confidence and comfort in my heart. Now, when I'm able to provide peer support to an individual, it's powerful. I'm able to lead by example. If I did it, there's no reason why you can't do it either.

CNN: Your nonprofit has grown beyond the initial support group. What other resources do you offer?
Patel: We'll do basic home modifications -- safety grab bars in bathrooms, door widening, wheelchair ramps. We'll do car modifications. So, if somebody's missing both of their limbs and wants to drive, we'll help them with hand controls. If there's a right-foot amputee, we can put a left-foot accelerator in. Just to promote independence so they can take their kids to school. They can go back to school. They can go back to work. I really try to promote healthy lifestyles, staying physically fit. I've exposed our members to various activities: yoga, horseback riding, wake surfing, hiking, skiing and tennis, recently.
On average, a very basic prosthesis can cost anywhere from $8,000 to $25,000. And if somebody doesn't have insurance, a lot of times they just go without a prosthesis because not everybody can afford to buy privately. There are different organizations in the community that I refer our members to. And then we will provide prosthetic limbs to those that that have no access to any other options and resources.
CNN: Today, nearly 30 years later, how do you see the journey as an amputee?
Patel: I tell the people that I work with, ""It may take you a while to figure out the 'why,' but you'll come to know why this has happened to you."" Twenty years (after starting work), I know why this happened to me. It has become my platform professionally, philanthropically -- just to embrace the people that come to me. And I hold their hand through as much as they need me to.
I have members from over the past 20 years who I still help in different ways. It's like I'm on speed dial. I get to guide them and watch them shine through the things that they never thought they'd ever be able to accomplish.

1925,"North Koreans process salmon, snow crab eaten in US, Europe","Americans buying seafood for dinner may inadvertently have subsidized the North Korean government as it builds its nuclear weapons program, an Associated Press investigation has found. Their purchases may also have supported forced labor.
At a time when North Korea is banned from selling almost anything, the country is sending tens of thousands of workers worldwide to bring in an estimated $200 million to $500 million a year. That could account for a sizable portion of North Korea's nuclear weapons and missile programs, which South Korea says have cost more than $1 billion.
While North Korean workers have been documented overseas, the AP investigation reveals that some products they make go to the United States. AP also tracked products made by North Korean workers to Canada, Germany and elsewhere in the European Union.
In response to the investigation, Senate leaders said Wednesday that the U.S. needs to keep products made by North Koreans out and get China to refuse to hire North Korean workers.
""The (Trump) administration needs to ramp up the pressure on China to crack down on trade with North Korea across the board,"" said top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer.
At Chinese factories, North Korean workers aren't allowed to leave their compounds without permission, and must step from housing to factories in pairs or groups, with North Korean minders. They receive a fraction of their salaries, while the rest — as much as 70 percent — is taken by the North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's government.
John Connelly, president of the National Fisheries Institute, urged its 300 members, including the largest seafood importers in the U.S., to ""ensure that wages go to the workers, and are not siphoned off to support a dangerous dictator.""
Besides seafood, AP found North Korean laborers making wood flooring and sewing garments in Chinese factories. Those industries also export to the U.S., but AP did not track specific shipments except for seafood.
American companies aren't allowed to import products made by North Korean workers anywhere in the world, and companies doing business with them could face criminal charges for using North Korean workers or materially benefiting from their work. (The AP employs a small number of support staff in its Pyongyang bureau under a waiver granted by the U.S. government to allow the flow of news and information.)
U.S. Customs and Border Protection, responsible for enforcing the law, did not respond to requests for comment.
""This is a state-sponsored scheme to export folks who are in bonded labor,"" said Luis CdeBaca, former U.S. ambassador for human trafficking issues. ""It's supporting a repressive regime.""
Western companies involved that responded to AP said forced labor and potential support for North Korea was unacceptable in their supply chains. They said they'd investigate, and some said they'd already cut off ties with suppliers.
Meanwhile, as many as 100,000 North Koreans continue to work in construction in the Gulf states, shipbuilding in Poland, logging in Russia and on fishing boats in Uruguay. New U.N. sanctions bar countries from expanding their North Korean workforce. Despite the pay and restrictions, the jobs abroad are highly coveted among North Koreans.
Roughly 3,000 North Koreans are believed to work in Hunchun, a Chinese industrial hub near the North Korean and Russian borders.
At some factories, laborers work hunched over tables as North Korean political slogans blasted from loudspeakers. When a reporter approached a group of North Koreans — women in tight, bright polyester clothes preparing a meal at a garment factory — one confirmed that she and some others were from Pyongyang, the North Korean capital. Then a minder arrived, ordering: ""Don't talk to him!""
It's unknown what conditions are like in every factory, but AP reporters saw North Korean laborers living and working in several facilities, including joint venture Hunchun Dongyang Seafood Industry & Trade Co. Ltd. & Hunchun Pagoda Industry Co. Ltd., distributed globally by Ocean One Enterprise; Yantai Dachen Hunchun Seafood Products, and Yanbian Shenghai Industry & Trade Co. Ltd.
They're getting their seafood from China, Russia and the U.S.
Despite AP seeing North Korean workers, Hunchun Dongyang's manager Zhu Qizhen denied that they hire them and refused to give details. The other Chinese companies didn't comment.
Shipping records show more than 100 cargo containers of seafood were sent to the U.S. and Canada this year from the factories where North Koreans were working in China, including packages of snow crab, salmon fillets and squid rings.
One importer, The Fishin' Company in Munhall, Penn., said it cut ties with Hunchun processors and got its last shipment this summer. Seafood can remain in the supply chain for more than a year.
Often the fish arrives in generic packaging. But some were already branded in China with familiar names like Walmart or Sea Queen, which is sold exclusively at ALDI supermarkets. There's no way to say where a particular package ends up, nor what percentage of a factory's products wind up in the U.S.
Walmart spokeswoman Marilee McInnis said company officials banned their suppliers from getting seafood processed at a Hunchun plant a year ago after an audit revealed potential issues with migrant workers.
""Combatting forced labor is a complex problem that no one company, industry, or government can tackle alone,"" she said.
ALDI did not comment.
Some U.S. companies had indirect ties to North Korean laborers in Hunchun. Customs records indicate that Chicken of the Sea, owned by Thai Union, did business with sister companies of the Hunchun factories in another part of China. Thai Union said the sister company they do business with meets all of their fair labor standards, and should not be penalized just because they have the same owner.
Boxes at the factories also had markings from several major German supermarket chains and brands. REWE Group, which owns REWE markets and the Penny chain, said their contract has expired with Hunchun Dongyang. All the companies that responded said suppliers were forbidden to use forced labor. Shipments also went to two Canadian importers, Morgan Foods and Alliance Seafood, which did not respond to requests for comment about who processes their seafood in China.
As the late summer chill set in one evening, a dozen or so women from Hunchun Pagoda played volleyball in the quiet road in front of the compound's gate.
A train horn blew. The women shouted to one another. A car with a foreigner drove by. One laughingly called out: ""Bye-bye!""

2972,Ugandan Rebel Group Massacres 22 in Congo,"NAIROBI, Kenya — Rebels from an Islamist militant group killed 22 people in an ambush in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo on Saturday night, the authorities said.
The killings, which came amid fighting that began on Friday night, were carried out by members of the Allied Democratic Forces, a rebel group with origins in neighboring Uganda that is accused of killing hundreds of people over the past three years.
There were 10 survivors, according to Balyesima Kadokima, a member of Parliament.
Many victims of the attack, in the Beni region of North Kivu Province, were state officials who were coming from the border city of Nobili to spend the weekend, said Teddy Kataliko, a local activist.
The rebels, armed with machetes and guns, ambushed a group of nine motorcycles traveling on the road from Nobili to Beni, said Omar Kavota, a member of North Kivu Civil Society, a nongovernmental organization.

Film producer Harvey Weinstein emailed Hollywood associates asking for help to avoid being fired by his own company, US media report
Weinstein was sacked amid a slew of sexual harassment allegations dating back decades.
In the email, he said he was ""desperate"" for help and called for the film industry to support him, the New York Times reported.
Hollywood stars have spoken of their shock at the allegations.
'Heavy therapy'
Meryl Streep told the Huffington Post she was appalled by the ""disgraceful"" news and praised the women who reported the alleged abuse as ""heroes"".
Dame Judi Dench, who won an Oscar for her role in the Weinstein movie Shakespeare in Love, called the claims ""horrifying"".
The email was sent on Sunday to studio executives and agents, the New York Times reported, hours before Weinstein was fired by the board of his company.
According to those who said they had seen it, the email read: ""My board is thinking of firing me. All I'm asking is let me take a leave of absence and get into heavy therapy and counselling.
""Whether it be in a facility or somewhere else, allow me to resurrect myself with a second chance. A lot of the allegations are false as you know but given therapy and counselling as other people have done, I think I'd be able to get there.
""I could really use your support or just your honesty if you can't support me.""
The email adds: ""We believe what the board is trying to do is not only wrong but might be illegal and would destroy the company. If you could write this letter backing me, getting me the help and time away I need, and also stating your opposition to the board firing me, it would help me a lot. I am desperate for your help. Just give me the time to have therapy. Do not let me be fired. If the industry supports me, that is all I need.""

Weinstein is one of the most powerful men in Hollywood, having co-founded the Miramax and Weinstein Company production firms. His films include Shakespeare in Love, The King's Speech and Pulp Fiction.
When the claims were first reported in the New York Times last week, Weinstein issued a statement in which he apologised for causing ""a lot of pain"".
However he later disputed the article, with one of his legal team claiming the newspaper's report was ""saturated with false and defamatory statements"".
Weinstein's lawyer, Lisa Bloom, said in another statement that the allegations against him were ""patently false"".
Bloom later announced she had resigned as Weinstein's adviser.
The allegations against him, according to the New York Times report, emerged mainly from young women hoping to break into the film industry and included celebrities Ashley Judd and Rose McGowan.
Among the accusations levelled against the film producer are that he forced women to massage him and watch him naked. In return for sexual favours, he promised to help advance their careers, they said.",fake
3809,Breakingviews - Sky investors choose between profit and principles,"LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Sky shareholders face a choice between principles and profit. Some investors are planning to oppose Chairman James Murdoch’s re-election because he is also chief executive of 39 percent owner Twenty-First Century Fox. But kicking up a stink might further jeopardise Fox’s offer for the European pay-TV group.
Sky investor Royal London Asset Management had a point last week when it called Murdoch’s dual role “inappropriate” and said shareholders would be better served by a truly independent chairman during the takeover. Shareholder advisory groups, meanwhile, object to Sky’s executive pay. One problem is that some long-term incentive packages could pay out with no performance conditions if Fox’s offer gets the green light, according to Glass Lewis.
Murdoch survived an investor backlash last year, winning election with around 70 percent support. Strip out Fox’s stake and abstentions, however, and just half of Sky’s independent shareholders backed the chairman.
Concerns about conflicts of interest are more pressing this time. Fox’s bid is on ice until at least March 2018 while UK authorities study its effects on the country’s media ownership and broadcasting standards. Sky investor Crispin Odey has argued that the delays are beginning to make the offer look on the low side.
That logic is questionable. When it was launched in December 2016, Fox’s offer of 10.75 pounds per share represented a 40 premium to Sky’s market value. The shares would probably fall to around 8 pounds if the bid is blocked. Notwithstanding their concerns about Murdoch’s independence, most Sky shareholders would bite Fox’s hands off if they got a chance to vote on the bid.
That is why investors might hesitate before lodging a protest vote as long as Fox and the Murdoch family are under a regulatory microscope. Campaigners have argued that past sexual harassment and phone-hacking scandals in the Murdoch empire are grounds for blocking the takeover. Drawing attention to the family’s governance shortcomings could add to the political pressure on UK Media Secretary Karen Bradley, who must rule on the deal. Sky shareholders have legitimate complaints. But those thinking with their wallets may decide to keep quiet.",fake
3150,Michigan to charge state's top medical official in Flint water deaths,"A sign is seen next to a water dispenser at North Western High School in Flint, a city struggling with the effects of lead-poisoned drinking water in Michigan, May 4, 2016. REUTERS/Carlos Barria
(Reuters) - Michigan’s top medical official will be charged with involuntary manslaughter for her role in the city of Flint’s water crisis, which was linked to an outbreak of Legionnaires’ disease that caused at least 12 deaths, state prosecutors said on Monday.
Dr. Eden Wells, the state’s chief medical executive who already faced lesser charges, would become the sixth current or former official to face involuntary manslaughter charges in connection with the crisis.
The state intends to add involuntary manslaughter and misconduct in office to the other charges of obstruction of justice and lying to police that Wells already faces, a spokeswoman for Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette said.
Jerold Lax, an attorney for Wells, said he first learned of the proposed additional charges at a pre-trial hearing on Monday when special prosecutor Todd Flood announced the state’s intention to file them.
Flood “indicated on the record that he would be providing us some additional information in relation to the charges,” Lax said, adding that he had no further comment.
The charges stem from more than 80 cases of Legionnaires’ disease that were believed to be linked to the water in Flint after the city switched its source from Lake Huron to the Flint River in April 2014.

Wells was among six current and former Michigan and Flint officials charged in June. The other five, including Michigan Health and Human Services Director Nick Lyon, were charged at the time with involuntary manslaughter stemming from their roles in handling the crisis.
Involuntary manslaughter is a felony that carries a sentence of up to 15 years in prison.

In court documents, prosecutors had previously said Wells lied to police about when she became aware of the Legionnaires’ outbreak and that she threatened a team of independent researchers who were studying the source of the disease.
Flood said Monday he was seeking the new charges based on new review of documents and testimony that came out last week, the Detroit Free Press reported.
The crisis in Flint erupted in 2015 when tests found high amounts of lead in blood samples taken from children in the predominantly black city of about 100,000.
The more corrosive river water caused lead to leach from pipes and into the drinking water. Lead levels in Flint’s drinking water have since fallen below levels considered dangerous by federal regulators, state officials have said.",fake

443,Can We Survive Technology? The Origin of SRM Geoengineering and the Modern Theory of Man-made Global Warming,"By Peter A. Kirby
In the course of exposing chemtrails, your author has already found and presented quite a bit of evidence linking the theory of man-made global warming to weather modification and thus the New Manhattan Project. Lately, he has stumbled upon what appears to be the earliest published mention of the modern theory of man-made global warming. In addition, this same reference is undoubtedly the earliest significant mention of the Solar Radiation Management (SRM) geoengineering thesis. The article in question is a 1955 Fortune magazine piece written by the famous Manhattan Project scientist John von Neumann (1903-1957) titled “Can We Survive Technology?” (PDF) This is the most potent evidence yet in support of the assertion that the theory of man-made global warming is a cover story for the biggest scientific effort in history.
If all this stuff about a New Manhattan Project and SRM geoengineering makes zero sense to you, then please review the author’s previous work “Chemtrails Exposed: A History of the New Manhattan Project.” There’s a whole subculture going on down here.
For background on von Neumann and his connections to the New Manhattan Project, one may review the author’s other previous article “Chemtrails Exposed: Truly a New Manhattan Project.”
“Can We Survive Technology?”
Ten years after the detonations of the world’s first atomic bombs and the subsequent Japanese surrender, and two years before his death, Fortune magazine published Johnny von Neuman’s “Can We Survive Technology?” It is undoubtedly the first significant mention of the SRM geoengineering thesis and arguably the first mention of the modern theory of man-made global warming.
It is interesting to note that the first words written at the top of the first page read, “The New Goals – VI.” If one glances at this phrase, one might read ‘The New Gods’ as the eye will have a tendency to amalgamate the ‘a’ and the ‘l’ in the word ‘Goals,’ turning these two letters into a ‘d’ and therefore forming the word ‘Gods.’ Maybe this is a subliminal message meant to deify von Neumann. And make no mistake, at the time, the world was standing in awe. After Manhattan Project scientists such as von Neumann had unleashed the terrible destructive power of the atom bomb and developed so many other technologies which enabled the Allied powers to win the war, top American scientists were drastically reshaping world power and were understandably respected. In fact, von Neumann in particular was a most highly revered scientist. Indeed, a strong argument can be made for von Neumann being the most revered American scientist of all time.
The opening sentence rings the alarm; stating, “‘The great globe itself’ is in a rapidly maturing crisis.” He then goes over how man’s technological capabilities are stretching the Earth’s resources and how this, if unchecked, might lead to global catastrophe. In this way, “Can We Survive Technology?” predates the later global warming fear mongering of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in their 1974 document “A Study of Climatological Research as it Pertains to Intelligence Problems.” This document expounds upon the notion that minor fluctuations in Earth’s average global temperature can lead to Humanity’s extinction. Never mind that Earth’s average temperature has been fluctuating for as long as Humanity has existed on Earth and Humanity has been doing just fine. They are smarter than you and they know. Just pay your taxes, take the medications and vaccinations, drink your fluoride, recognize the theory of man-made global warming as gospel truth, and die. This is what the establishment requires of us.
For more about the CIA’s “A Study of Climatological Research as it Pertains to Intelligence Problems,” please refer to the author’s previous article “Forging Reality: The New Manhattan Chemtrail Project Information War.”
It’s only fitting as in 1952 von Neumann became a CIA advisor.
In his piece, von Neumann rolls out the theory of man-made global warming and the SRM geoengineering thesis. Here these two theses were fused together to form a giant, flaming sword of evil to be used against domestic populations worldwide. He begins these sections with quite a bit about weather modification. It reads:
Controlled climate Let us now consider a thoroughly ‘abnormal’ industry and its potentialities – that is, an industry as yet without a place in any list of major activities: the control of weather or, to use a more ambitious but justified term, climate. One phase of this activity that has received a good deal of public attention is ‘rain making.’ The present technique assumes extensive rain clouds, and forces precipitation by applying small amounts of chemical agents. While it is not easy to evaluate the significance of the efforts made thus far, the evidence seems to indicate that the aim is an attainable one. But weather control and climate control are really much broader than rain making. All major weather phenomena, as well as climate as such, are ultimately controlled by the solar energy that falls on the earth. To modify the amount of solar energy, is, of course, beyond human power. But what really matters is not the amount that hits the earth, but the fraction retained by the earth, since that reflected back into space is no more useful than if it had never arrived. Now, the amount absorbed by the solid earth, the sea, or the atmosphere seems to be subject to delicate influences. True, none of these has so far been substantially controlled by human will, but there are strong indications of control possibilities.
His reference to reflecting sunlight back into space here is the first ever significant mention of the SRM geoengineering thesis; probably the first of any kind. The SRM geoengineering thesis was probably conceived by John von Neumann. Also note that von Neumann writes of a wholly different type of weather modification program; not the conventional cloud seeding industry. The New Manhattan Project is a wholly different kind of weather modification program. He makes two later mentions of such a program. He follows with the theory of man-made global warming. It continues:
The carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere by industry’s burning of coal and oil – more than half of it during the last generation – may have changed the atmosphere’s composition sufficiently to account for a general warming of the world by about one degree Fahrenheit. The volcano Krakatao[sic] erupted in 1883 and released an amount of energy by no means exorbitant. Had the dust of the eruption stayed in the stratosphere for fifteen years, reflecting sunlight away from the earth, it might have sufficed to lower the world’s temperature by six degrees (in fact, it stayed for about three years, and five such eruptions would probably have achieved the result mentioned). This would have been a substantial cooling; the last Ice Age, when half of North America and all of northern and western Europe were under an ice cap like that of Greenland or Antarctica, was only fifteen degrees colder than the present age. On the other hand, another fifteen degrees of warming would probably melt the ice of Greenland and Antarctica and produce worldwide tropical to semi-tropical climate.
Notice how in this passage von Neumann asserts the idea that ash spewing from an erupting volcano (in this case Krakatoa) will reflect sunlight back into space and therefore cool the earth. Today’s geoengineers make this point ad nauseum. We can stop wondering where they are getting this idea from. Von Neumann’s assertion of the volcanic ash global cooling thesis here may be the first ever.
Among many other assertions, he then goes on to suggest that, “Probably intervention in atmospheric and climatic matters will come in a few decades, and will unfold on a scale difficult to imagine at present.” and “The most constructive schemes for climate control would have to be based on insights and techniques that would also lend themselves to forms of climatic warfare as yet unimagined.” Von Neumann’s imagination has become reality.
Demarcation between old and new
It is important to note here the use of the word ‘modern’ when describing von Neumann’s assertion of the theory of man-made global warming. The term ‘modern’ is used here to describe a version of the theory of man-made global warming which has entered into popular culture and is connected to the SRM geoengineering thesis. The historical or ‘old’ version of the theory of man-made global warming was relegated to academia and not connected to the SRM geoengineering thesis. Yes, your author is making these grand assertions here and now all by himself.
The introduction of the SRM geoengineering thesis, in Johnny von Neumann’s 1955 Fortune piece is the demarcation point between the ‘old’ and ‘modern’ versions of the theory of man-made global warming. It is reasonable to consider the period before von Neuman’s paper as the era of the ‘old’ theory of man-made global warming and the period after von Neumann’s paper as the era of the ‘new’ or ‘modern’ theory of man-made global warming. This assertion is being made for two reasons: “Can We Survive Technology?” was the first insertion of the theory of man-made global warming into the popular culture and “Can We Survive Technology?” was the first major publication of the SRM geoengineering thesis.
“Can We Survive Technology?” was designed to insert the theory of man-made global warming into the popular culture. Before “Can We Survive Technology?,” the theory of man-made global warming was relegated to scientific journals and obscure books. Much of the material was in German. Articles and books relegated to scientific journals and/or foreign languages don’t tend to get a lot of attention from the American public. This article, published in a popular American magazine, opened the theory of man-made global warming up to many millions of minds … and we have seen how far they have ran with it since! Corrupt politicians and bureaucrats across the globe have artificially shoved this lie into the center of the Overton window. That process had to start somewhere and “Can We Survive Technology?” was the beginning of that process.
The other factor determining von Neumann’s piece as the demarcation between old and new is the introduction of the SRM geoengineering thesis. The SRM geoengineering thesis effectively weaponized the theory of man-made global warming. Weaponization in this case requires a huge expansion of the military-industrial-academic-intelligence complex. This meant a big, fat gravy train and all parties involved were all for it.
Beyond von Neumann
Johnny was not alone. Von Neumann and pretty much all of the other top Manhattan Project scientists were proponents of what they called ‘planetary engineering;’ analogous, of course, to today’s geoengineering. In essence, pretty much all of the other top Manhattan Project scientists were proponents of weather control.
Following von Neumann’s lead, other prominent scientists later came forward with the SRM geoengineering thesis and/or the theory of man-made global warming. The first three examples of the SRM geoengineering thesis are all written in the context of weather modification. Two out of the first three examples of the SRM geoengineering thesis also mention the theory of man-made global warming.
In the early months of 1958, Manhattan Project scientist Bernard Vonnegut alluded to the SRM geoengineering theory in the article he co-authored as part of the most cited weather modification report ever. He and his co-authors wrote, “The radiation properties of the atmosphere can be altered by the introduction of gases or aerosols and by cloud seeding.”
In June of 1958, weather modifier and science adviser to the president Howard T. Orville wrote an article for Popular Science magazine titled “Weather as a Weapon” which asserted the theory of man-made global warming in addition to the SRM geoengineering thesis.
The next major incursion in their information war waged against the American public came with the release of a 1965 document emanating from the LBJ White House in 1965 called “Restoring the Quality of Our Environment.” This Orwellianly (Is that a word?) titled document asserts both the theory of man-made global warming and the SRM geoengineering thesis. This document is particularly significant because it was issued by the Executive Branch of the United States Federal Government. When documents are issued by the Executive Branch of the United States Federal Government, all government offices must review it and be in general compliance.
Conclusions
The modern theory of man-made global warming and the SRM geoengineering thesis have a symbiotic relationship. The SRM geoengineering thesis supercharged the old theory of man-made global warming. At the same time, the SRM geoengineering thesis barely exists without the theory of man-made global warming. It only makes sense that both would be introduced and/or upgraded at the same time.
It also makes dollars and sense that von Neumann’s piece was published in Fortune magazine. The evidence shows plenty of financial motives behind today’s New Manhattan Project. To review these motives, one may review the author’s previous article “Cui Bono? New Manhattan Project Motives.”
“Can We Survive Technology?” was a weaponization of the theory of man-made global warming and therefore a green light to the military-industrial-academic-intelligence complex. Up until the publication of “Can We Survive Technology?” the theory of man-made global warming was only something that existed as just that; a theory. When the theory of man-made global warming was linked to the SRM geoengineering thesis, the military-industrial-academic-intelligence complex had a new enemy to fight; the climate. A new enemy to fight means more basic science, new weapons systems, and intelligence agency cover. In other words, it means a mountain of power and cash raining down upon them. In 1955 von Neumann handed the military-industrial-academic-intelligence complex an argument for tremendous expansion and they have taken him up on it ever since; spending vast sums on weather modification and the atmospheric sciences. In fact, it wasn’t long after von Neumann’s 1955 Fortune piece that the American military-industrial-academic-intelligence complex was the beneficiary of tremendous across-the-board spending increases catalyzed by Russia’s Sputnik launch of 1957.
Yes, due to advancing technology and population growth, Earth’s resources are currently being depleted at an unsustainable rate. And yes, we have lots of big environmental problems. But man-made global warming is not one of them and the solutions offered by the establishment are wholly inadequate and counterproductive. For crying out loud, their solutions to these problems are spraying the Earth with toxic chemicals and death. Their so-called solutions are worse than the problems. Their solutions are massively destructive, cruel, and unsustainable.
For more about the establishment’s predilection for mass murder, please refer to the author’s previous article “Other New Manhattan Chemtrail Project Agendas.”
Mom taught me that there is always a better solution and I taught me that the solution will not come from the top down as have these non-solutions offered by the establishment. All real solutions come from the bottom up. The solutions are free energy, better governments and the colonization of other planets. But those solutions are too empowering for Humanity. Those solutions embody far too much common sense. Our rulers do not operate on common sense or empowering Humanity. They operate on greed, selfishness, and fear and that is why this modern theory of man-made global warming and the SRM geoengineering thesis are chosen and promulgated. That’s why their ‘solution’ wrecks our environment.
I challenge the audience to find an earlier published mention of the SRM geoengineering thesis. These early mentions are almost all made in combination with the theory of man-made global warming. Delingpole, I’m ready for my close-up! Morano, are you up to the challenge? Monckton, I’ll give you a civil debate. Steyn, I’ll take em’ all on! Seriously, if somebody out there knows any of these leading climate heretics: James Delingpole, Marc Morano, Christopher Monckton, Mark Steyn and/or others; please pass this article on to them, I want to know what they think. Separately I’ll be sending this article to them via their respective websites.
WE ARE IN A WAR, PEOPLE!!! THEY ARE TRYING TO MAKE YOU BELIEVE THAT AN APPLE IS AN ORANGE SO THAT THEY MAY KILL YOU AND EVERYTHING ELSE ON THE PLANET! I SUGGEST THAT WE REFUTE THEIR ASSERTIONS! Please share this link. Thank you.

952,Dave Doeren has finally gotten that signature win,"Dave Doeren has finally gotten that signature win
(Before It's News)
The tenure of Dave Doeren has been an interesting one at NC State. He was brought in to win games, and in his first 4 seasons it was looking rocky. He was not beating teams that he should have (last year ECU, BC are just 2 of those examples). The fan base was becoming very restless in Raleigh.
The complaints were many, and wide ranging. There was the dismissal of Offensive Coordinator Matt Canada, there was “he lacked personality,” and then there was the no signature wins. No wins against teams that he had less “talent” than. That all ended on Saturday, with the Wolfpack’s victory against Florida State. Now, people will say, that the reason that NC State won is because FSU lost Deonndre Francois. Others will say it was because of the ref’s and some questionable calls (yes, there were some).
Still others will say it was because of the 2 week layoff that the Seminoles had because of Hurricane Irma (this is the only one I’ll give you). Through all of this, Dave Doeren’s team came out and did what it needed to do. The Wolfpack defensive line was dominant, making life hell for FSU’s true freshman quaterback. The offense was balanced rushing the ball 37 times and passing 33 times.
Dave Doeren has been working on all of the things that critics have been throwing at him. If you watched him on The Coaches Room during the National Championship game last season, you saw the personality come out! He was funny and engaging! Dave Doeren needed this game against FSU!
He won against a team that will be a top 25 team at the end of the season! Now all he has to do, is not allow this team to rest on this win and continue carrying on that intensity that they took to Doak Campbell Stadium this past Saturday.

3710,Week 5 Rankings (2017): Top 20 Tight Ends,"Week 5 Rankings (2017): Top 20 Tight Ends
(Before It's News)
by Eric Stashin (aka The Rotoprofessor)
Tight end continues to be one of the most frustrating positions to fill, and trying to maneuver around bye weeks just complicates our decisions even more. Of course we are starting to get a better understanding of matchups that can be exploited, and that helps in finding those streaming plugins. Who are the options to utilize this week? Who should we avoid? Let’s take a look at how our rankings shake out:
Rob Gronkowski – New England Patriots – at Tampa Bay Zach Ertz – Philadelphia Eagles – vs. Arizona Travis Kelce – Kansas City Chiefs – at Houston Delanie Walker – Tennessee Titans – at Miami Jimmy Graham – Seattle Seahawks – at Los Angeles Rams Charles Clay – Buffalo Bills – at Cincinnati Jason Witten – Dallas Cowboys – vs. Green Bay Cameron Brate – Tampa Bay Buccaneers – vs. New England Benjamin Watson – Baltimore Ravens – at Oakland Evan Engram – New York Giants – vs. Los Angeles Chargers Hunter Henry – Los Angeles Chargers – at New York Giants Kyle Rudolph – Minnesota Vikings – at Chicago Jared Cook – Oakland Raiders – vs. Baltimore Austin Seferian-Jenkins – New York Jets – at Cleveland Eric Ebron – Detroit Lions – vs. Carolina Antonio Gates – Los Angeles Chargers – at New York Giants Jesse James – Pittsburgh Steelers – vs. Jacksonville Martellus Bennett – Green Bay Packers – at Dallas Tyler Kroft – Cincinnati Bengals – vs. Buffalo Zach Miller – Chicago Bears – vs. Minnesota
Thoughts:
We all know that rookie tight ends are tough to trust, but Evan Engram has already been targeted 30 times and racked up 19 receptions for 200 yards and 1 TD. You prorate that out for a full 16 weeks and you get 76 catches and 800 yards, with the potential for the TD count to grow quickly. That puts him on the map as a viable TE1 option every week.
The thought was that Delanie Walker’s value could take a hit, thanks to the improved receiving corps and focus on the running game. Instead Walker continues to be not only a viable option, but one of the more trustworthy. He’s topped 50 yards in three of his four games, and has also been targeted 6+ times in three contests. With the constant opportunities he’s going to remain a must use option.
Stepping in for the injured Tyler Eifert it was a big day for Tyler Kroft, with 6 receptions, 68 yards and 2 TD against the Cleveland Browns. Of course the opponent needs to be considered and we wouldn’t expect him to be able to replicate that type of performance. There’s potential value, but he’s more of a TE2 as opposed to a trustworthy option.
The New York Giants have allowed 5 TD to opposing tight ends, meaning both Hunter Henry and Antonio Gates need to be on our radars this week. Neither have been overly impressive, but Henry has the greater upside and you’d think the targets will be there (which hasn’t been the case most weeks). He’s a risky TE1, but a usable one depending on your alternatives.
Austin Seferian-Jenkins is coming off a solid Week 4 (4 receptions for 46 yards) and now gets to take on the Cleveland Browns (who are allowing the second most points per week to opposing tight ends). While it’s impossible to trust him as a TE1, unless you are desperate, he’s a viable TE2 in all formats.

3945,Google admits its new smart speaker was eavesdropping on users,"A major flaw has been detected in the newly-unveiled Google Home Mini speaker that allows it to secretly record conversations without users knowing.
Last week, Google showed off its next-generation smart speakers at an event in San Francisco. Following the event, it sent members of the press home with a review unit of the Google Home Mini, expected to launch on October 19.
Android Police tech blogger and founder Artem Russakovskii was the first to discover a bug in the software used by those devices. After using the gadget, he went to his Google (GOOG) activity account page and noticed it was populated with audio clips recorded in his home.
The Google Home Mini saved recordings at times when the wake word ""OK Google"" wasn't used. (A wake word typically triggers smart devices like Google Home and the Amazon Echo to start listening to your verbal commands).
It's not uncommon for companies like Google and Amazon (AMZN, Tech30) to keep the audio smart speakers hear -- but in this case, the device wasn't activated by the wake word.
""My Google Home Mini was inadvertently spying on me 24/7 due to a hardware flaw,"" he wrote on the site.
A Google spokesperson confirmed the issue to CNN Tech and said it stems from the touchpad, known as the activation button, on the devices given to early reviewers.
Unable to fix the glitch with the touchpad, Google has sent out a software update which will now permanently disable it. This means users will only be able to activate the device with voice commands. The volume and on/off buttons on the side of the device will continue to work.
Related: Google unveils new Pixel phones, speakers, futuristic headphones
""We take user privacy and product quality concerns very seriously. Although we only received a few reports of this issue, we want people to have complete peace of mind while using Google Home Mini,"" the Google spokesperson said.
Because the Google Home Mini ($49) doesn't officially launch until next week, no paying customers have been impacted.
Meanwhile, it appears the new larger-sized Google Home Max smart speaker ($399) doesn't have the bug.
But the issue draws attention to the privacy concerns over ""always-on devices"" that listen for wake words.
""The Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice should investigate this incident, as well as the general use of 'always-on' devices,"" Marc Rotenberg, the President of the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) told CNN Tech.
EPIC has pending complaints with the FTC and DOJ alleging that always-on devices like Google Home, Echo and Siri violate consumer protection law and federal wiretap law.
In the meantime, Google allows users to deactivate any existing Google devices from saving audio recordings via its settings page.",fake
1815,Dolphins Coach Adam Gase Has No Issues With Jay Cutler in the Wildcat,"(Before It's News)
Dolphins coach Adam Gase on Wednesday defended quarterback Jay Cutler’s role in the Wildcat, James Walker of ESPN.com reports.
Lined up outside as a receiver during Sunday’s 20-0 loss to the New Orleans Saints, Cutler was mocked heavily on social media for not moving on the play and keeping his hands on his hips. However, Gase said Cutler did the right thing, and he wasn’t concerned about the quarterback’s body language.
“Yes. As soon as he steps forward, they can knock the … I won’t say it, but they can hit him,” Gase said. “If he steps back or doesn’t move, now you’re looking at different kinds of penalties. Until you go through it, where a quarterback steps off the ball and starts working downfield and you watch one of them get blasted.”
Cutler agreed with Gase that he was just carrying out his assignment. The quarterback even made light of the situation.
“That’s what they told me to do: Sit there, don’t get hit, don’t touch anybody, don’t move,” Cutler said. “I feel like I executed that one.”",credible

2208,UK PM May tells business chiefs: two-year Brexit transition is assured - source,"LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May told business leaders that they should treat a two-year transition period after Brexit as assured as she tries to ease company concerns that Britain could crash out of the EU without a deal, a source told Reuters.
May met business chiefs from GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L), Vodafone (VOD.L) and HSBC (HSBA.L) and other major companies on Monday to hear what they want from talks on Britain’s relationship with the EU after Brexit.
Businesses have become increasingly alarmed by the slow progress of negotiations and the prospect that the country could leave the trading bloc without a new trading arrangement in place in 2019.
“From her point of view, the transitional agreement is non-negotiable ... business should think of the two-year period as assured. It will happen,” the source said when asked what May had said during discussions on Monday.
A spokeswoman from May’s office said she restated her position “that the government’s goal is for a smooth, orderly exit in which there is only one set of changes for businesses and people”.
Almost all business leaders expressed concern about access to talent after Brexit and several told May that the investment cycle means there are decisions coming at the end of 2017 and the start of 2018, the source said.
Last week, two sources told Reuters that Japanese carmaker Toyota (7203.T) intended to build the next version of its Auris car at its British car plant on the assumption that the government secures a transitional Brexit deal in a decision due by the end of the year.

Both May and her finance minister, Philip Hammond, acknowledged during Monday’s meeting that businesses needed a better sense of Britain’s post-Brexit relationship with the European Union.
“May said business needs clarity,” the source said. “The chancellor (finance minister) said clarity is more important than perfection.”
Business chiefs have previously complained that their voice has been drowned out by disagreement and division in the government, and they have not heard anything to give them the certainty they need to plan and invest in their businesses.
May’s office said she stressed the importance of engaging with the business community to design the proposed implementation arrangements, and promised to have continued meetings with a wide variety of business voices.
May was joined by Hammond, business minister Greg Clark, minister for exiting the EU David Davis and trade minister Liam Fox at the council.
Companies attending also included Balfour Beatty (BALF.L), WPP (WPP.L), Morgan Stanley (MS.N), Aston Martin and AB Foods (ABF.L), the government said.
The meeting came after May’s authority was further undermined last week.
She had to fend off a challenge from up to 30 of her lawmakers who had been pushing for her to quit following a disastrous snap election in June which saw the ruling Conservatives lose their parliamentary majority.",fake

Immigration officials announced Thursday that they had arrested almost 500 illegal aliens during a 4-day operation. Operation “Safe City” was conducted mainly in sanctuary cities that intend to shield illegals from deportation. Baltimore, Denver, Los Angeles, New York, Philadelphia, Seattle, Washington, Cook County Illinois, Santa Clara County, California and areas in Massachusetts. “Sanctuary jurisdictions that do not honor detainers or allow us access to jails and prisons are shielding criminal aliens from immigration enforcement and creating a magnet for illegal immigration,” ICE Acting Director Tom Homan, said in a statement. “As a result, ICE is forced to dedicate more resources to conduct at-large arrests in these communities.” “It’s clearly a political move that is not actually geared toward public safety,” Talia Inlender, an immigrant advocate, told the Los Angeles Times. According to an ICE statement those arrested included many illegals charged with multiple crimes: In Baltimore, a citizen of El Salvador who entered the U.S. illegally on a fraudulent passport, and was previously charged with attempted murder/conspiracy to commit murder and convicted of first-degree assault. She was previously released from local custody before ICE could assume custody. In Boston, a citizen of India who entered the U.S. illegally and who was convicted of …

33,"Weakening Nate brings rain, tornado warnings to U.S. South","BILOXI/PASCAGOULA, Miss. (Reuters) - Hurricane Nate weakened to a tropical depression on Sunday after coming ashore in Mississippi, flooding roads and buildings but sparing the state from catastrophic damages.
Maximum sustained winds from Nate, the fourth major storm to hit the United States in less than two months, dropped to 35 miles per hour (55 km per hour) as it moved through Alabama and into Tennessee.
The remnants of the storm spawned tornado warnings in those states and the western portions of North Carolina and South Carolina. It is forecast to bring gusty winds and up to 4 inches (10 cm) of rain to parts of Ohio, Pennsylvania and New York on Monday.
The storm made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane, the weakest designation by the U.S. National Hurricane Center. Only a few hours earlier, its winds had been blowing at 70 mph (113 kph) but appeared to lack the devastating punch of its recent predecessors.
Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant told reporters there had been no deaths or reports of catastrophic damage. “We are very fortunate this morning and have been blessed,” he said.
Nate killed at least 30 people in Central America before entering the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico and bearing down on the U.S. South. It has also shut down most oil and gas production in the Gulf.
Nate follows hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, which have devastated areas of the Caribbean and southern United States.
The tropical depression’s center will move up through Alabama into Tennessee and Kentucky through Monday, the hurricane center said. Heavy rainfall and storm-surge flooding remained a danger across the region, and the hurricane center said Florida’s Panhandle and parts of Alabama and Georgia might feel tropical storm-force wind gusts.
The storm was expected to bring three to six inches of rain to parts of western North Carolina through midday Monday, with up to 10 inches possible in isolated spots. Power outages, damaged homes and roads closed by debris were all reported in the region.
Nate made its first U.S. landfall on Saturday evening near the mouth of the Mississippi River and then made a second one early on Sunday near Biloxi, Mississippi.
In Biloxi, water surged over roads during the storm and quickly receded on Sunday, leaving a boat that broke loose marooned on the beach. At a Waffle House restaurant, the storm surge deposited a dumpster in its parking lot.
Jeff Pickich, a 46-year-old wine salesman from D‘Iberville, Mississippi, was counting his blessings. Heavy winds left only minor damage, blowing down part of a fence on his rental property in Biloxi.
“I‘m just glad,” he said, digging fresh holes for fence posts. “I was afraid of the water. The water is Mother Nature. You can’t stop it.”
Water flowed through Ursula Staten’s yard in Biloxi, pushing over part of her fence and scattering debris, but did not breach her house.
“I have a mess,” the retired massage therapist said. “If we had got Irma, I would have lost everything.”

At the Golden Nugget Casino, one of eight Biloxi gaming establishments, workers rushed to clean up mud, debris and minor damage from 3 feet (1 m) of water sloshing into an entrance and the parkade. The gaming room stayed dry.
Three hundred guests remained in the hotel, some eager to try their luck after surviving Nate.
But dangers from the storm remain, with Florida Governor Rick Scott warning of tornadoes springing up in the Panhandle region and Alabama Governor Kay Ivey urging residents to prepare for strong winds and storm surges.
U.S. President Donald Trump declared federal emergencies in Alabama and Florida on Sunday, which provides additional funding for disaster relief.
Mississippi Power had restored electricity to 10,000 customers, but 4,800 were still without it. More than 1,000 people had arrived at shelters, the state Emergency Management Agency said.
Slideshow (16 Images)
Alabama Power said it had restored electricity to 58,000 of 146,000 customers who lost it.
Rainfall of 3 to 6 inches (8 to 15 cm), with a maximum of 10 inches (25 cm), was expected east of the Mississippi River in Alabama and Tennessee, the hurricane center said.
NEW ORLEANS THREAT DOWNGRADED
Forecast at one point to make landfall in Louisiana, Nate headed farther east and spared many New Orleans parishes that were devastated by Hurricane Katrina 12 years ago.
“I had prayed for this - that we would be spared,” said Amos Cormier, president of Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana’s equivalent to a county.
Bernice Barthelemy, a 70-year-old Louisiana resident, died from cardiac arrest overnight after telling Reuters on Saturday that she did not mind having to evacuate, Cormier said on Sunday. He attributed her death to the stress of the move.
New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu said he expected that evacuated residents could return home soon.
Vessel traffic and port operations at New Orleans resumed on Sunday afternoon, while the Port of Mobile in Alabama remained closed. Oil ports, producers and refiners in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama were planning reopenings as the storm moved inland on Sunday.
The storm curtailed 92 percent of daily oil production and 77 percent of daily natural gas output in the Gulf of Mexico, more than three times the amount affected by Harvey.
The storm doused Central America with heavy rains on Thursday, killing at least 16 people in Nicaragua, 10 in Costa Rica, two in Honduras and two in El Salvador.

Detroit Lions defensive tackle Akeem Spence said Wednesday that he has received harassing voicemails on his personal phone after he decided to kneel during the national anthem prior to the team's Week 3 clash with the Atlanta Falcons. Spence also said his father has received calls.
""It was just nonsense, man,"" Spence said, according to MLive.com's Kyle Meinke. ""Nonsense voicemails, just stuff like that. It was weird. I don't know how they got my number or my father's number.
""It was just some harsh words, but it's just people being bitter and everything like that. I didn't take anything from it. Like I said, I pray for those people because right now we need that in this country. We need prayer. We need people to come together. We need unity. So that's all I want, man, and that's all I want for everybody else.""
Spence added that there were ""10-plus"" voicemails left on his phone by angry fans, according to the Detroit Free Press' Dave Birkett.
Days after the Lions' loss to the Falcons, Spence tweeted that his father, who owns Spence Concrete in Florida, was denied a job because of his decision to kneel during the anthem:
""It didn't change (my attitudes toward protesting),"" Spence said, per Meinke. ""It just made me want to act more. But at the same time, you know, just seeing how it affected my family was a little strange.""
Prior to Sunday's win over the Minnesota Vikings, Spence and almost all of the Lions players, with the exception of Jalen Reeves-Maybin and Steve Longa, stood with their arms linked during the national anthem after owner Martha Ford asked players not to kneel.
Speaking to reporters Wednesday, Spence said that while he would have preferred to kneel, he ultimately wanted to show solidarity with his teammates.
""I'm a team guy first so we spoke about it as a team and that’s what we wanted to do,"" Spence said, per Birkett. ""As badly as I wanted to take a knee, I respect the guys in this locker room, I respect this team and that’s what we wanted to do.""",fake

2097,The Ditch List: Breaking Down Four Players It May Be Time To Cut Bait On,"The Ditch List: Breaking Down Four Players It May Be Time To Cut Bait On
(Before It's News)
by Eric Stashin (aka The Rotoprofessor)
Not every cut is created equal, and it’s going to depend on your league size/format in many cases. That said there have been some obviously disappointing starts to the season and in the right circumstance three weeks is enough information to formulate a decision, cut bait and move on. Let’s take a look at a few candidates that you should consider dropping:
Joe Flacco – Baltimore Ravens – Quarterback
Calling the trip to London a disastrous one would be an understatement, as Flacco was pulled after going 8-18 for 28 yards, 0 TD and 2 INT. We knew it would be a slow start, after he was nursing injuries throughout the preseason, but he’s now thrown for just 366 yards, 3 TD and 4 INT over the first three weeks of the season. In fact Baltimore has limited him to under 20 passes in two of the three games (though he would’ve thrown more in Week 3 had he not been removed).
You have to think that things will improve, but considering the improvements of players like Jared Goff is it really worth waiting around for a player who would’ve been a low-end option anyways? Especially in single-quarterback formats the time has come to move on.
Cam Newton – Carolina Panthers – Quarterback
Newton is in a similar spot to Flacco, except for the fact that he has the upside of a Top 10 option (and potentially Top 5). While Newton has been working his way back from injury, he’s also watched his top receivers drop like flies with both Greg Olson and now Kelvin Benjamin out for potentially multiple weeks (Olson has already hit the IR). That leaves Newton with a solid running back corps (and Christian McCaffrey is going to be a great receiving option), but little talent on the outside. Devin Funchess (who turned 10 targets into just 4 receptions yesterday) is left as the #1 option, and will be followed by some type of combination f Ed Dickson, Curtis Samuel and a few other underwhelming options.
Newton could be saved by his ability to tuck the ball and run for a TD, but that’s hardly going to be enough. Depending on your waiver wire he’s going to be worth stashing, but in shallower one-quarterback formats there are going to be more dependable options available for the short-term.
Thomas Rawls – Seattle Seahawks – Running Back
Instead of seeing his role increase in his second game on the field, Rawls didn’t get a single touch. Granted it was more of a pass first attack (Russell Wilson attempted 49 passes), but it was Chris Carson (11 carries for 34 yards) and C.J. Prosise (4 carries and 3 receptions) who shared the backfield. Game flow played a role in the decision, but this is a bad sign for Rawls’ outlook moving forward.
We wouldn’t want to have a quick trigger finger, especially if you have the room on your bench to continue stashing him. However viewing him as nothing more than a handcuff, and as droppable in 10-team leagues, is the way to go.
Terrelle Pryor – Washington Redskins – Wide Receiver
Are we really prepared to just dump a player who put up 77 receptions for 1,007 yards and 4 TD a year ago? That may be a stretch, but it’s getting hard to justify utilizing him. Despite Kirk Cousins throwing for 365 yards on Sunday night, Pryor converted just 2 of 4 targets for 19 yards. After being targeted 11 times in Week 1, he has 8 total targets the past two weeks (and overall he has 10 receptions for 116 yards and 0 TD).
Even in his breakout last year Pryor wasn’t a source of TD and it’s possible he was more of a product of his situation playing for a lackluster Browns’ franchise a year ago. At best he’s a player to stash, but he shouldn’t be anywhere near starting lineups.

Braying banshee Hillary Clinton just continues to expose her sick mind as she enters week three of the “poor, poor pitiful me” tour to promote her new book What Happened?
That Clinton belongs in the mental ward of a supermax prison has already been established but she just continues to pour it on as she rages against the man who beat her fair and square along with 63 million Americans who gave her a resounding thumbs down at the polls.
But the longer it continues, the more that it becomes apparent that the world dodged a major bullet when her ace campaign strategists decided that Rust Belt votes didn’t matter. This is NOT a person who should have ever been given access to the launch codes to the nation’s nuclear arsenal.
The latest exhibit of the workings of a deranged and bitter mind dribbled out during an interview with PBS host Charlie Rose where Mrs. Clinton compared President Trump to Vladimir Putin and suggested that Trump could order the execution of journalists.
Clinton Compares Trump to Putin: ‘Hopefully He Hasn’t Ordered the Killing of People and Journalists’ https://t.co/Prrp1mYMIM — Free Beacon (@FreeBeacon) September 26, 2017
Via the Washington Free Beacon “Clinton Compares Trump to Putin: ‘Hopefully He Hasn’t Ordered the Killing of People and Journalists’”:
Hillary Clinton said Monday on Bloomberg News that President Donald Trump has “tendencies toward authoritarianism,” adding that she hopes he has not “ordered the killing of people and journalists” as Russian President Vladimir Putin has been accused of doing. During a conversation with Charlie Rose, she compared Trump to Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose relationship with Trump has particularly drawn scrutiny from Democrats and the media. Clinton discussed her ideas on Trump’s view of democracy, saying she “hopes” the president is not exactly like Putin in every way. “I don’t think he really values democracy, Charlie,” Clinton said. “He doesn’t value democracy? Rose asked. “So he’s not a ‘democrat,’ little ‘d?’” Clinton replied, “No, he’s not, he’s a top-down guy.” “He’s an authoritarian?” Rose asked. “He has tendencies toward authoritarianism,” Clinton answered. “So, he’s no different than Putin?” Rose asked. Clinton did not say Trump was different from the Russian autocrat, instead saying he “hopefully” does not commit the same crimes as Putin. “Well, hopefully he hasn’t ordered the killing of people and journalists and the like,” Clinton replied.
But of course Charlie Rose didn’t even bat an eye at this insane statement proving that Hillary’s biggest enablers are in the media.

3683,The Chicago Bears Week Four Observations,"The Chicago Bears Week Four Observations
(Before It's News)
By Bryan Dietzler
After a somewhat successful game against the Pittsburgh Steelers the previous Sunday, the Bears headed north to Lambeau Field to take on the Green Bay Packers. The Packers have had the Bears number for a while, but Chicago has been able to sneak in a win now and then.
I was one of many people who felt that the Bears would make Thursday night’s game against the Packers a close one. You would have thought that with the Packers missing some of their key starters the Bears may have a better chance of not just keeping it close but could win the game. Green Bay had not been playing that well either so it appeared as if Chicago would have a good chance.
At least on paper, it looked like that would happen.
But it didn’t.
In another weird game, the Bears struggled to get anything going while the Packers looked like world beaters.
Chicago lost to Green Bay 35-14.
The Bears made many errors and just couldn’t seem to do the right thing. Green Bay made it look easy and it really shouldn’t have been as easy as it was.
In a word, it was frustrating.
The following is a look at some of the observations made during the game and some critiques of the Bears’ performance. Granted, there was more bad than good but there may be at least one big positive thing that comes out of the loss that will help set the Bears in the right direction.
Glennon’s Decline and Removal
I said this in my story about the Steelers game HERE about Glennon looking pretty bad. Well, folks, he followed up last Sunday’s performance with a miserable game against the Packers. Sure, his stats don’t look terrible as he threw 33 passes completing 21 of those for 218 yards and a touchdown. But it was the two interceptions and two fumbles that did him in. That, coupled with his poor decision-making, pocket presence and mobility and Glennon showed us, once again, that he is not a starting NFL quarterback.
Glennon’s showing Thursday forced the Bears to bring in Mitchell Trubisky as their starter. A new era has begun in Chicago and we will hope it’s a good one. It is certainly necessary.
What Glennon has received in his contract, compared to what he has done for the Bears makes him look like a thief. Chicago paid him like a starting quarterback, he hasn’t delivered and is not what the Bears felt he could be. Perhaps Chicago’s offense didn’t fit Glennon’s style?
It’s likely more Glennon’s fault than anyone else’s’.
One thing is for sure and that is that the Bears weren’t going to win many games with Glennon at quarterback. And they may not win that many with Trubisky but the future is now.
Starting the rookie was the best thing for the Bears future and it was time for the Glennon era to end.
The Hit that Shook the World
By now, the hit that linebacker Danny Trevathan delivered on Thursday night has a been analyzed, replayed and talked about repeatedly. It’s almost old news. The most important thing is that Davante Adams not seriously injured. He is no longer in the hospital and is in the league’s concussion protocol.
We learned the other day that Trevathan was suspended for one game for the hit (it was reduced from two games).
Did he get what he deserved?
If you have seen the hit, it’s scary. I know people who had anxiety over the hit and it was difficult to watch for some. The hit appeared to be completely blatant and, in my opinion, it looked like it could have been avoided. Of course, it depends on who you talk to as to whether you think it could have been avoided.
And I am not a football player and cannot relate to how things happen in a moment like that. That being said, I am not an expert and I don’t claim to be an expert.
Most everyone seems to think the hit was blatant and that Trevathan got what he deserved. Some fans seem to think it was an avoidable hit.
The suspension puts the Bears in a bind. One of their best defensive players is going to be out for a game leaving the Bears thin at an already thin position. Chicago will now have to rely on guys like John Timu, Jonathan Anderson, and Christian Jones.
Hopefully, they will step up.
The Dynamic Duo
Much has been said about the impact that Jordan Howard and Tarik Cohen have had for the Bears. You can credit them for the Bears’ win against the Steelers. Also, despite the fact, the Bears lost big on Thursday Howard and Cohen piled up the yards.
The two have been the most positive aspect of the Bears’ offense so far.
There has been some concern that the Bears are going to wear Howard down by utilizing him so much. The evidence that he is getting beat up has been easy to see. Howard could hardly get up three times during the Steelers game and appeared to be hurt at least once in the Green Bay game.
It’s been reported that he has an AC joint sprain and that’s why we have been seeing him favoring his shoulder a bit this season.
With the Bears running Howard as much as they have been the question now becomes, how much longer will he last? And if he can’t go can Cohen run the ball consistently?
The answers are not long and no.
What we need to see is more of Benny Cunningham. He is the key. If the Bears can have him come in and spell the starters more often that will work wonders for the running game. We saw the coaching staff get Cunningham involved in the game Thursday night so they need to keep that up.
If they don’t, Chicago’s best running backs will fall apart; the running game will grind to a halt and Chicago will drop even deeper into the hole.
Quick Hits
There are just a few quick things I would like to say about the game and the Bears in general.
Strong safety Quintin Demps was put on injured reserve this past week. His play was disappointing anyway and it might have been only a matter of time before he got hurt. Now we wait to see if Adrian Amos can do anything special. He has yet to get an interception since coming into the league and that’s very disturbing.
I have talked about Pernell McPhee a lot since he came to Chicago. I have been critical of him but I am going to give him props for a fine performance against the Packers. With one sack and three tackles, McPhee is slowly starting to look like the player we hoped he would be when he came to Chicago
Hopefully, he will continue to improve and not get injured.
Leonard Floyd got out of the doghouse a bit as he got his first sack of the year Thursday night. There were some, including this writer, who felt Floyd could lead the NFL in sacks. That may not happen. He has been asked to drop into coverage a lot thanks to his speed so he is missing out on sacks that way. But Floyd is getting stymied at the line when trying to rush the passer.
There is still a lot of work Floyd needs to do to become an effective pass rusher.

3093,Europe's Most Innovative Universities - 2017,"(Reuters) - Europe’s top tech hubs tend to radiate from massive capital cities like London, Berlin and Paris. But the heart of European innovation isn’t a major metropolis –it’s a small city in the Dutch-speaking region of Flanders. That’s the conclusion of Reuters’ second annual ranking of Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, a list that identifies and ranks the educational institutions doing the most to advance science, invent new technologies, and help drive the global economy (Compare all 100 schools here).
REUTERS TOP 100
The most innovative university in Europe, for the second year running, is Belgium’s KU Leuven. This nearly 600-year-old institution was founded by Pope Martin V, but today it’s better known for technology than theology: KU Leuven maintains one of the largest independent research and development organizations on the planet. In fiscal 2015, the university’s research spending exceeded €454 million, and its patent portfolio currently includes 586 active families, each one representing an invention protected in multiple countries.
How does a relatively small Catholic university out-innovate bigger, better-known institutions across Europe? KU Leuven earned its first-place rank, in part, by producing a high volume of influential inventions. Its researchers submit more patents than most other universities on the continent, and outside researchers frequently cite KU Leuven inventions in their own patent applications. Those are key criteria in Reuters ranking of Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, which was compiled in partnership with Clarivate Analytics, and is based on proprietary data and analysis of indicators including patent filings and research paper citations.
The second most innovative university in Europe is Imperial College London, an institution whose researchers have been responsible for the discovery of penicillin, the development of holography and the invention of fiber optics. The third-place University of Cambridge has been associated with 91 Nobel Laureates during its 800-year history. And the fourth-place Technical University of Munich has spun off more than 800 companies since 1990, including a variety of high-tech startups in industries including renewable energy, semiconductors and nanotechnology.
Overall, the same countries that dominate European business and politics dominate the ranking of Europe’s Most Innovative Universities. German universities account for 23 of the 100 institutions on the list, more than any other country, and the United Kingdom comes in second, tied with France, each with 17 institutions. But those three countries are also among the most populous and richest countries on the continent. Control for those factors, and it turns out that countries with much smaller populations and modest economies often outperform big ones.
The Republic of Ireland has only three schools on the entire list, but with a population of less than 5 million people, it can boast more top 100 innovative universities per capita than any other country in Europe. On the same per capita basis, the second most innovative country on the list is Denmark, followed by Belgium, Switzerland and the Netherlands. Germany, the United Kingdom and France rank in the middle of the pack, an indication that they may be underperforming compared with their smaller neighbors: On a per capita basis, none of those countries has half as many top 100 universities than Ireland.
Students walk out of a faculty building of Imperial College London, Britain, May 27, 2016. REUTERS/Toby Melville/File Photo
And the same trends hold true if you look at national economies. According to the International Monetary Fund, in 2016 Germany’s gross domestic product exceeded $3.49 trillion –11 times larger than Ireland at $307 billion, yet Germany has only 7 times as many top 100 innovative universities.
Some countries underperform even more drastically. Russia is Europe’s most populous country and has the region’s fifth largest economy, yet none of its universities count among the top 100. Other notable absences include any universities from Ukraine or Romania–a fact that reveals another divide between Western and Eastern Europe.
To compile the ranking of Europe’s most innovative universities, Clarivate Analytics (formerly the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters) began by identifying more than 600 global organizations that published the most articles in academic journals, including educational institutions, nonprofit charities, and government-funded institutions. That list was reduced to institutions that filed at least 50 patents with the World Intellectual Property Organization in the period between 2010 and 2015. Then they evaluated each candidate on 10 different metrics, focusing on academic papers (which indicate basic research) and patent filings (which point to an institution’s ability to apply research and commercialize its discoveries). Finally, they trimmed the list so that it only included European universities, and then ranked them based on their performance.
Slideshow (8 Images)
This is the second consecutive year that Clarivate and Reuters have collaborated to rank Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, and three universities that ranked in the top 100 in 2016 fell off the list entirely: the Netherland’s Eindhoven University of Technology, Germany’s University of Kiel, and the UK’s Queens University Belfast. All three universities filed fewer than 50 patents during the period examined for the ranking, and thus were eliminated from consideration. They’ve been replaced by three new entrants to the top 100: the University of Glasgow (#54), the University of Nice Sophia Antipolis (#94), and the Autonomous University of Madrid (#100).
The returning universities that made the biggest moves on the list were the Netherland’s Leiden University (up 21 spots to #17) and Germany’s Technical University of Berlin (up 21 spots to #41). Belgium’s Université Libre of Brussels (down 17 to #38) and the UK’s University of Leeds (down 17 to #73) made the biggest moves in the opposite direction. Generally, though, the list remained largely stable: Nine of the top ten schools of 2016 remained in the top 10 for 2017, and 17 of the top 20. This stability is understandable because something as large as university paper output and patent performance is unlikely to change quickly.
Of course, the relative ranking of any university does not provide a complete picture of whether its researchers are doing important, innovative work. Since the ranking measures innovation on an institutional level, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: a university might rank low for overall innovation but still operate one of the world’s most innovative computer science laboratories, for instance. And it’s important to remember that whether a university ranks at the top or the bottom of the list, it’s still within the top 100 on the continent: All of these universities produce original research, create useful technology and stimulate the global economy.

575,Australian Cybersecurity Report Shows Gaps in Private Companies’ Defenses,"Experts say that private industry has been one of the most glaring vulnerabilities in Australia’s cybersecurity. Tuesday’s report, the Australian Cyber Security Center Threat Report, noted that 734 private-sector systems of “national interest” were affected by cyberattacks last year.
“Certain companies take cybersecurity quite seriously,” said Alana Maurushat, academic co-director of the Cyberspace Law and Policy Center at the University of New South Wales in Sydney. “But you have key industries to Australia who — while there may not be the same media coverage — you know through internal sources are being breached. Our mining industry has notoriously been rumored to have been breached by competitors.”
Ms. Maurushat said that Australia as a whole was not far behind the rest of the developed world’s level of cybersecurity, but emphasized concerns about its private sector.
“The crazy thing about this is that they don’t even know that they’ve been breached,” she said. “There are certain breaches that occur, and there are studies on this, where sometimes someone would be on your system for almost a year, without the breach even being noticed. That’s the stuff that keeps me up at night.”
A cybersecurity report released this year by Telstra, the country’s dominant telecommunications company, said that 59 percent of surveyed companies in Australia had detected a security breach on at least a monthly basis. A similar number reported experiencing at least one ransomware attack. Over half of Australian organizations that came under such an attack paid the ransom, the report said.

Ms. Maurushat said that, in part, Australia’s private-sector cybersecurity was lacking because of an acute shortage of skilled workers.
The government report also noted “extensive” state-sponsored activity against Australia’s government, saying that its defense contractors continued to be targeted by foreign nations’ cyberespionage efforts.
At a news conference on Tuesday, Mr. Tehan said that the government was pivoting toward offensive capabilities to “prevent and shut down safe havens for offshore cybercriminals.”
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Last year, the Australian government blamed foreign actors for an attack on its online census portal.
“The whole census thing — that’s an I.B.M. mistake,” Ms. Maurushat said, referring to the technology company’s contracting role in the census. “That’s not a government mistake, that’s an industry mistake, from a company you wouldn’t expect to make those errors.”
In a settlement over the census problems, I.B.M. paid the government about 30 million Australian dollars, or about $23 million.
Not unlike vaccines and herd immunity, Ms. Maurushat said, a government’s cybersecurity is only as strong as those it chooses to share its data with.
When asked whether Australia’s lagging digital infrastructure and poor internet speeds might have a detrimental effect on its security, Ms. Maurushat said that a beleaguered attempt to speed up Australia’s internet, the National Broadband Network initiative, may prove to be a silver lining.
“It’s the opposite,” she said, adding that hackers rely on fast internet speeds. “So in some ways, if the N.B.N. is a disaster, it might be better for us.”",fake

By Rich Mitchell
In an ongoing public relations tidal wave on tax reform, the House Republicans released a video that tries to answer the question “why does tax reform matter to you?”
More time with family, higher take-home pay, more good-paying jobs and advantages for small business owners are just some of the points the video kinda makes.
The short presentation follows a set of appearances, tweets, facebook posts and statements made by Paul Ryan and House members pushing tax reform. But, educating Americans isn’t going to pass the bill – or even get it out of committee. It’s popular, Americans want it so quit selling and close the deal.
Whether or not real tax reform, with easier filing, less complexity, and lower taxation, is up to Congress. And the people will call, email, fax, and write their members until this is passed.
Failure to pass reform will continue the growing wave of anti-incumbent, anti-Washington sentiment that will impact both Republicans and Democrats.
Oh yeah… here’s that barely informative video they released:

805,Spain Catalan crisis: Reaction to Puigdemont from Madrid and Barcelona,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Pro-independence supporters react as they watch Carles Puigdemont's speech in Barcelona
In a speech on Tuesday evening to the regional parliament in Barcelona, Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont said Catalonia had won the right to be independent but that he wanted to begin negotiations with the Spanish government in Madrid.
His comments came after a disputed October 1 referendum which saw violent clashes between national police and pro-independence demonstrators.
Madrid has promised to block any move by Catalonia to break away and will hold a special cabinet meeting on Wednesday to discuss its official response.
So how have both cities reacted to Mr Puigdemont's speech?
'Fears of lost momentum' - The BBC's Gavin Lee in Barcelona
Close to where Parliament sit, beneath the arches of Barcelona's Arc de Triomf monument, tens of thousands of independence supporters packed the walkway to watch President Puigdemont's parliamentary address on the big screens.
The dominant colours were the red, yellow and blue of the Estalada, the Catalan separatist flag, and hundreds of placards, posters and T-shirts simply read ""Si"", marking the Yes votes made during last Sunday's banned referendum that the Spanish government says was unconstitutional.
There was a mixed response when Carlos Puigdemont began to explain that he was effectively suspending an independence declaration, waiting on the prospect of talks with the Spanish government.
When he talked of recognising the results of the independence referendum, many in the crowd cheered and whooped.
But any premature sounds of excitement or expectation disappeared quickly, and after an hour of speech making the crowd became muted as it was clear now that the Catalan president was effectively suspending a declaration.
The crowd dispersed moments after. ""We're upset, but we've attracted worldwide attention to our little land,"" Roger tells me, hugging his partner, who said she felt let down by the president.
There's a wider fear though, among independence supporters, that the government hasn't made the most of the momentum it had.
But Adriana, 21, told me she understood that the region's leaders were in a checkmate position, with the Spanish government waiting to take over the Catalan Parliament in the event of an immediate declaration.
For now, there's no sign of trouble, just disappointment.
A Spanish word - ""conllevado"" - sums up the divide here. It means ""to exist with the problem"", and after tonight, the Catalan independence movement, those who seek to prevent it, and those in between seeking to be heard, will all need to ""conllevado"" a little while longer.
'Patience wearing thin' - James Badcock in Madrid
With Spain's government due to hold a special cabinet meeting on Wednesday morning to discuss its official response to Catalan President Puigdemont's partial declaration of independence, the leader of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy's Popular Party in Catalonia gave a hint as to what that reaction might be.
""The legitimate state will not permit any independent republic of Catalonia,"" said Xavier García Albiol in the Catalan parliament on Tuesday night.
""Catalonia and Spain cannot go on a minute longer mired in such insecurity,"" he added.
Indeed, although the Catalan leader's announcement was cagey - near enough a proclamation of independence to keep his fragile pro-independence coalition together, but not too strong to make a harsh reaction from Spain inevitable - Mr Rajoy had already said that any declaration of independence would be opposed by ""all legal means"".
The government has previously admitted that it is considering whether to trigger a never-before-used power from Spain's constitution: article 155, which allows for central government to take control of a regional authority, or parts of it, to stop breaches of the rule of law.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Demonstrators in Madrid protest against Catalan independence on 7 October
""The government has two options,"" says Pablo Simón, a political expert from Madrid's Carlos III University.
""One is to appeal the declaration to the constitutional court, which will annul its effects, and then use article 155 very selectively if the Catalan government takes any actual steps towards implementation.
""The other is to apply article 155 in all its force and with all its consequences, which is a bit like pressing the nuclear button and launching a battle within public opinion.""
In the streets and homes of the Spanish capital, patience with the defiance shown by Catalonia's government is wearing thin.
""Spain's legitimate state has to take action,"" says Mario Perales, a civil servant from Madrid.
""I am amazed by the absolutely irresponsible attitude of leaders who have managed to divide Catalan society, a society with a high standard of living which these spurious ambitions are putting in danger.""",fake
1981,"Journalist Travels To North Korea, Brings Back Photos Very Different From MSM","By Brandon Turbeville
As the United States continues to drum up support for possible military intervention in North Korea, the propaganda attacks launched against the isolated Asian nation by the mainstream corporate press have intensified as well. Ranging from the semi-legitimate to the ridiculously absurd, the corporate media has launched a campaign of insults balanced only by its “resistance movement” to Donald Trump. In this case, however, Trump has the rare backing of the corporate press if only in the by the fact that the media is cheering for war harder and faster than Trump is perhaps willing to give it to them.
The corporate press has presented the entirety of North Korea as a state in which no independent thought is allowed, starvation is rampant, haircuts are mandated, and the population of the country is essentially kept in a massive prison camp with messages of brainwashing piped in to every home.
Yet, in the middle of all the propaganda and the talk of war, one journalist, Eva Bartlett, actually traveled to North Korea to get a firsthand impression and on-the-ground grasp of just what North Korea looks like, a sense of the culture, and what is on the minds of North Koreans. The pictures, videos, and stories she brought back with her tell a much different story than what is being portrayed on the screens of Western media.
While this writer is not attempting to paint North Korea as a utopian land of plenty and bastion of personal freedom, presentations of the country that are alternative to what corporate media outlets have portrayed cannot be ignored. After all, the Western media has repeatedly demonized and lied about nation after nation on the list slated for Western invasion and destruction. From Saddam’s incubator babies, Ghaddafi’s Viagra jihad, and Assad’s killing his own people, lie after lie has led the gullible American public to war. Unfortunately, only after the fact have the lies been exposed on a massive scale.
On August 24, Eva Bartlett and a handful of other activists and journalists entered North Korea as a delegation for the purpose of hearing what North Koreans had to say about their country, their culture, and the constant threat of war from the United States. They stayed in North Korea from the 24th to the 31st.
The photos that Bartlett returned with show impressive, ornate infrastructure that rivals anything in the United States and modern cities with clean and relatively content people. It shows a country that can indeed keep the lights on. The level to which Pyongyang has been rebuilt and developed after a war that saw the entirety of the city destroyed and nearly twenty percent of the North Korean population killed, truly stands in contrast to the portrayal by State Department and its media mouthpieces.
I highly encourage the reader to access and peruse Batrlett’s article “Photos From A Week In The DPRK,” where she has posted a collection of photographs taken on her trip to North Korea as well as a series of videos.
Bartlett has also posted a number of photos and videos showing the streets of Pyongyang full of people, in contrast to the propaganda that the city never has any civilians in it coming from many Western circles.
While corporate media outlets have used recycled smuggled footage of North Korean ghettos, starving orphans, starving people, and other gritty aspects, Eva Bartlett was able to bring back pictures of a country with excellent infrastructure, plenty of food, healthcare, and a people who, in her words, were not in any way “cowed.” Bartlett praised the level of education that the children in the schools that she visited as above the level of anything the United States or Canada is able to provide and was even able to take a few rides on the roller coaster at the amusement park in Pyongyang.
Bartlett describes a country full of people who want peace with the United States but who are not afraid of the U.S., nor are they afraid of defending themselves should that war come.
As Phil Taylor, with whom Bartlett conducted an interview that I recommend the reader take a listen to, stated,
North Korea does not exist in black and white. Witness Eva Bartlett’s photos and be struck by the colour. Despite a barrage of propaganda designed to portray a monochromatic dystopia, North Korea is a vibrant country populated by real human beings. Phil interviews Eva, whose timely voyage to the DPRK shines a light on a land darkened by our own ignorance.
Clearly, North Korea is authoritarian and it would not be considered a free country by any reasonable standards. The question of large-scale prison camps, labor camps, and the crackdown on political dissent still exist. Its experiment with socialism alone has resulted in the curtailment of many rights. However, in 2017, how many countries could be considered genuinely free? The United States with the largest prison population in the world? France and Germany with their thought crime legislation? China with its slave labor and toxic soil? Those who live in glass houses should not throw stones.
North Korea has, however, managed to stay free from Western central banking and the dictates of the Anglo-European financier system and, for this reason, it has found itself in the crosshairs of the imperial West.
At the end of the day, however, it doesn’t matter whether or not the propaganda surrounding North Korea is true. What matters is that the United States give up on the foolish adventure of imperialism and its current job as the hammer and fist of the Western banking establishment. From the point of view of the United States, North Korea’s internal question of freedom and democracy should be irrelevant. North Korea’s internal issues are just that – internal issues – and they should be decided by the North Korean people.
Regardless of the questions of whether or not North Korea is truly a free society, Eva Bartlett’s recent trip has cut through much of the intense propaganda surrounding the country in the run up to war and the constant need to use North Korea as a tool for the strategy of tension.

3845,Florida Supreme Court Rules Police May Detain Passengers During Traffic Stops,"By Aaron Kesel
Florida’s Supreme Court has ruled that police may detain passengers any and all passengers during even minor traffic stops and that doing so does not violate constitutional rights to hold someone not suspected of any wrongdoing for a “reasonable” time, The Newspaper reported.
The high court made the ruling after evaluating a January 29, 2015 traffic stop in which a car with a broken tail light was pulled over in Gainesville for allegedly rolling through a stop sign. Gregory Presley was one of two passengers in the stopped vehicle questioned by Officer John Pandak about who he was and where they were going. The officer asked if any of the passengers had been drinking and Presley questioned why would that be a problem.
“I don’t know, man,” Officer Pandak replied. “This is a traffic stop, you’re part of it. So we’re hanging out. That’s all there is to it…. Well, we’re just talking, man. You can’t go anywhere at the moment because you’re part of this stop. That’s all.”
It turns out after running the records of Presley the police officer found out that he was 0n probation for alcohol. Presley was arrested and taken to jail. At trial, Presley argued that the stop violated his Fourth Amendment rights, protection from unreasonable searches and seizures and tried to suppress the evidence against him gained in what he called an “illegal detention.”
Florida’s appellate courts were split on the question, so the high court stepped in to resolve the issue. The justices agreed with prosecutors that an officer’s safety trumps a passenger’s rights.
“The intrusion upon personal liberty is de minimis because the method of transport has already been lawfully interrupted by virtue of the stop, the passenger has already been stopped by virtue of the driver’s lawful detention, and routine traffic stops are brief in duration,” Chief Justice Jorge Labarga wrote for the court.
The court added that a passenger of a vehicle cannot be detained any longer than the amount of time it takes to check the driver’s license and write a ticket unless there is a reason to suspect the passenger is involved in any wrongdoing.
“Detention is permissible for this limited period of time because it allows law enforcement officers to safely do their job accomplishing the ‘mission’ of the stop and not be at risk due to potential violence from passengers or other vehicles on the roadway,” Justice Larbarga said.
Another Justice, Barbara J. Pariente, agreed with the other judges on the landmark decision, but she noted that this was a case in which a black man was interrogated in his neighborhood in the morning against his will.
“When the traffic stop does not give rise to a need to question passengers or ask for their identification, I fail to comprehend why the interrogation of passengers on matters unrelated to the traffic stop, so long as those inquiries do not measurably extend the duration of the stop, does not intrude on the constitutional guarantee to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures,” she wrote.
The Justices declined to address whether or not the new law would affect transportation businesses such as buses and taxis, if a driver was pulled over for a minor traffic violation. In its current state, this ruling theoretically would allow a police officer to detain an entire bus load of people against their will.
“In reaching this holding, we expressly decline to address whether law enforcement may detain passengers during a traffic stop of a common carrier or a vehicle that, at the time of the stop, is being utilized as part of a transportation-based business,” Justice Labarga noted.

230,"Bali volcano on brink of eruption for the first time since 50 years, evacuations ordered","A volcano near Bali has sent thousands of villagers in an evacuation mission as it is widely believed that the volcano could erupt, the last one having taken place nearly 50 years ago.
 
Bali on high alert after tremors around Mount Agung volcano
 
Tourists have been alerted to not go in hiking or camping expeditions anywhere close to the volcano site, with authorities highly recommending staying away for at least 4 miles (6 kilometers). The volcano is known as Mount Agung, and it has made the earth shake and tremble, with smoke spouting from its gaping crater as vividly witnessed by bystanders. The site is located 3 kilometers above sea level, roughly 9,840 feet.
 
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a representative of the National Disaster Management Agency, had this to say about the possible calamity, ""Volcanic activity remains high and there are indications of magma rising to the surface and causing tremors There should be zero public activity within the specified radius in case there is an eruption.""

Scientists Warn: North Korean Super Volcano on Brink of Eruption
WARNING: Italian SUPERVOLCANO on the brink of ERUPTION
 
Representatives have stated that more than 6,000 villagers and tourists have been evacuated from the nearby area, with much more still to come.
 
Active Volcano Mount Agung Erupts (1963)
 
 
Still, some native folks did not wish to be evacuated, preferring to stay. Some of these villagers were situated at the base of the mountain which the volcano calls home. Other tourists even preferred to witness the volcano with the possible danger of eruption!
 
One villager named Wayan Suarda had this to say during a live television interview by channel tvOne, ""I'm here with my husband. We need to feed the animals, so that's what we're doing first.""
 
<img src=""http://www.abc.net.au/news/image/8976390-3x2-700x467.jpg"">
 
The volcano is located in the country of Indonesia, which is just alongside the deadly 'Pacific Ring of Fire, ' infamously named because its geographical position lends itself to dangerous tectonic activity. It is estimated in a recent US Geological Survey, that 90% of the earth's seismic activity takes place because of this fissure.
 
The country itself has close to 130 active volcanoes, easily beating out other countries for most in the world.
 
The last eruption for Mount Agung took place between 1963 and 1964. It was a chain of eruptions that devastated the land and led to more than 1,000 people and countless other reported injured.
 
It has been reported by some villagers that the eruption is the result of a secret cult that recently started to spread itself in the country. One villager, who wished to remain anonymous for safety purposes, stated that the cult has been holding strange rituals at sites near the volcano. While most authorities cannot verify this fact with absolute certainty, many tourists have noted that loud chants can be heard at night when the moon can be seen from the sky.
 
A group of tourists recently attested that they witnessed the cult amidst one such ritual. One of their members, a German from Frankfurt, went on to say that the ritual involved the skinning of animals, mostly rodents, interesting dances around a fire, and the calling of a familiar name in Asian culture: Shiva.
 
It is not known whether there is any connection between the volcano being awakened and the manifestation of the cults, but it still is a rather ominous sign, with some villagers vowing to investigate further to prevent more calamities from taking place.

735,Blackhawks Roster Breakdown: Forwards,"Blackhawks Roster Breakdown: Forwards
(Before It's News)
With opening night less than a week away, the Blackhawks are down to some tough decisions with their roster. We talked at length about the options on Tuesday night’s Shoutcast, but there are some real questions. I’m going to break down some of the upcoming roster decisions or at least try to lay them out in a logical manner. This doesn’t mean Joel Quenneville will decide to use the logical method. Lastly, we look at the offense:
Brandon Saad – Jonathan Toews – Richard Panik
This is your first line, and it has been since the day the Blackhawks traded Artemi Panarin for Brandon Saad back in June. We all know what we are going to get from Saad and Jonathan Toews. Richard Panik is a bit more of a wild card. No one believed me when I predicted that Panik could easily replace the 34 points that were sent to Montreal with Andrew Shaw. No only did Panik replace the points, but he eclipsed it. By a decent margin. He played all 82 games, and contributed 22 goals, 22 assists for 44 points. These are all better than Andrew Shaw has ever reached in his career. I don’t expect that Panik will have 22 goals again, but it’s really not all that unreasonable. With Saad on the other wing, Panik will have more room to work. As long as he is in the right place, he will have every opportunity to equal that 44 points. This line is light years better now than it was in April. Expect Jonathan Toews to have a bounceback typical Jonny Toews year, and for Brandon Saad to have a career year. Saad is coming off three straight 50+ point seasons, and this year will be no different. 60 points is not unfathomable.
Alex Debrincat – Nick Schmaltz – Patrick Kane
I know, the Debrincat hater has him not only making the team, but playing in the top 6. If you look at the alternatives, there really aren’t any. Unless they move Nick Schmaltz back to wing, no one else fits the position, and they certainly haven’t been playing Schmaltz at center all preseason only to dump him back at the wing. I think Debrincat will hit the wall in ten games and they will need to re-adjust but, for the moment, it won’t hurt to try this combo out to open the season. Speaking of Nick Schmaltz, this kid has impressed me. He was a pouty little brat, last season, once he was sent to Rockford and it rubbed me the wrong way. Granted he still has that pouty look on his face all the time, but his play has grow leaps and bounds. He was “good” last season, after he came back from Rockford, but this preseason he has been excellent. I would have never placed him at second line center, but that is where he has been the entire preseason. He has not looked out of place either. This makes you wonder what the future holds for new third line $4.55 million center Artem Anisimov. Patrick Kane is; Patrick Kane. I don’t want to say too much or the PC Police will come after me.
Patrick Sharp – Artem Anisimov – Ryan Hartman
If we didn’t expect to have Debrincat or Schmaltz on the second line, we certainly didn’t expect to see Artem Anisimov on the third line. If Debrincat makes the team, I’m fine with Sharp on the third line, and if Debrincat doesn’t, then someone like Wingels or Hayden can slide up. Ryan Hartman is a perfect third line player and will have a solid year once again there. Anisimov is a perfectly fine third line center, but I have my reservations about paying a player $4.55 million for the next 4 years to play on the third line. At some point they have to investigate getting him to waive that no trade clause and clear that cap room. For the near future, he is perfectly fine in the third line role. Even if he can’t win a faceoff to save his life. Circling back to Debrincat, Quenneville toyed with playing him on this third line with Anisimov and Hartman, and I’m not a fan whatsoever. He is not really responsible defensively, yet, and he is not a player that drives possession by himself. He needs to be set up for his chances, by skill players. Anisimov and Hartman are good, but they are good straight line players. They are not going to set Debrincat up with beautiful passes, or dazzling moves. I cannot see this experiment working, and you are not putting him in a position to succeed based on his skillset.
Tommy Wingels – Tanner Kero – Lance Bouma
Tomas Jurco, Jordin Tootoo, John Hayden,Vinnie Hinostroza
This fourth line is a complete mystery. You might as well just throw all the names in a hat and randomly pick them out. What you see above is not what I would select, rather what I think Quenneville and Bowman will decide. Tanner Kero is a fine, responsible fourth line center and should have that position locked down. Tommy Wingels, Lance Bouma and Jordin Tootoo are basically the same player in “small, medium, sort-of-large” sizes. If Quenneville wants to keep one of those three players as a 13th forward for the “grit”, that’s fine by me. Keeping all three is simply preposterous. My honest opinion is that they should keep Wingels and Hayden, waive Bouma or Tootoo, and launch Tomas Jurco into the sun. This is not the year to waste roster spots on players that you mistakenly signed or traded for. The problem with this entire scenario is that the Blackhawks rarely ever admit their mistakes, which means Wingels, Bouma, Tootoo, and Jurco will all make the roster. This leaves Hayden and Hinostroza heading due west to Rockford, even though John Hayden has done everything to make this opening night roster. We are only talking about 6-8 minutes a night for this line, but it is just not the best way to maximize your talent. There I go applying logic again. Please allow me to beat any logic out of my brain with a 2×4.

817,Defense challenges doctor's finding in Kim killing case,"On the third day of the trial of two women accused of killing the estranged half brother of North Korea's leader, defense lawyers sought to discredit the prosecution's case, but it was the presentation of physical evidence that caused a stir.
Siti Aisyah of Indonesia and Doan Thi Huong of Vietnam have pleaded not guilty in the Feb. 13 murder of Kim Jong Nam using banned VX nerve agent at a crowded airport terminal in Kuala Lumpur.
The women have said they thought they were playing a harmless prank for a hidden-camera TV show and had been hoodwinked by men suspected of being North Korean agents. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is believed to have considered his older sibling a potential rival for power.
A judge and court officials wore face masks and surgical gloves in Malaysia's High Court as samples were admitted as evidence of where VX was found on Kim Jong Nam's body and clothing.
Prosecutors and defense lawyers then took a 20-minute break to examine the samples, which were sealed in transparent plastic bags. Most wore gloves and masks as a safety precaution after prosecutors warned the VX-tainted items may still be dangerous.
DR. MOHAMAD SHAH MAHMOOD, head of the Forensic Unit at Kuala Lumpur Hospital
Mohamad Shah, who testified Tuesday that he believed Kim's death was caused solely by ""acute VX poisoning,"" defended his finding, saying an expert chemist's report had clearly shown the presence of VX, and that was supported by his autopsy.
Defense lawyers have contended that the conclusion Kim was killed by VX was biased and prejudicial to the accused, saying the autopsy findings and clinical symptoms merely showed chemical poisoning.
Mohamad Shah said toxicology tests found six types of drugs in Kim's blood that are used to treat diabetes, hypertension and gout, but those drugs and the state of Kim's health would not have caused his swift death.
Under cross-examination by defense lawyers, he admitted he had limited knowledge of VX and nerve agents in general. He said he didn't know the amount of the poison that was used.
The defense lawyers also sought to cast doubt that VX was applied on Kim by the two women. They have said the defendants could not have carried out an attack with VX without being affected themselves.
Mohamad Shah agreed with a defense assertion that it would be tough to detect needle puncture marks on Kim's body because he was heavily tattooed, but said there was only a ""slim chance"" of needle poisoning. He acknowledged he would not know if VX had been given to Kim through food and drinks before he arrived at the airport.
Mohamad Shah agreed that VX in its liquid form is tasteless, odorless and sticky, syrupy or oily, making it difficult to clean off so a person can be decontaminated.
DR. RANJINI SIVAGANABALAN, government doctor specializing in clinical toxicology
Ranjini said VX can cause excessive salivation, sweating, vomiting, seizure, pinpoint-size eye pupils and diarrhea.
She said decontamination usually involves washing with soap and water, but agreed with the defense's assertion that this may not fully remove the poison, depending on the quantity applied.
The onset of VX poisoning is ""very rapid,"" with symptoms seen ""usually within seconds or minutes,"" Ranjini said. But if the dose is very low — and depending on temperature — it could take longer, she said, adding that VX may not be fatal at a very low dosage.
Ranjini disagreed with the defense's assertion that as little as 10 milligrams of VX, just a tiny drop, would be lethal to humans, saying there has been no experimentation on humans anywhere.",fake

(Before It's News)
Stephen Strasburg had a calm first; Gerrit Cole was lucky to get out with a run after three singles and a double. He was saved by a liner-back-the-box DP and a Marte-Rodriguez-Diaz cutdown at home. Strasburg was strong; he struck out five-of-six in the second & third and didn’t give up a hit until the fifth when Gregory singled off 1B Ryan Zimmerman’s mitt. The wheels fell off in the sixth. The Nats strung together three singles in four at-bats off Cole Train to plate a run and bring in AJ Schugel. He was tagged for a homer, walk and knock before Johnny Barbato was waved in to pull the plug. Strasburg and Angel Sanchez traded zeroes in the seventh. Stephen walked a couple of Bucs in the eighth to run his pitch count up to 98, so Ollie Perez (yes, the one and same) strolled in to put out the fire. Dan Runzler took his turn and Zimmerman took him long. Then Jason Werth did the same. Wade LeBlanc was reintroduced to the mound (it’s his first appearance since September 13th) and punched out Matt Wieters for the third out. Matt Grace gave up a Starling single and Cutch double to lose the shutout but not the game.
Starling may be the only Buc sad to see the season end… (photo Dave Arrigo/Pirates)
Another very meh performance by Cole Train (his final 2017 line is 12-12, 4.26), backed not at all by the bats, though, of course, Mr. Strasburg does make hitters besides the Pirates look silly. Ah well, two games to go and then…well, that’s the question, right?
Notes:
Starling again had two hits, as many as the rest of the team together.
Some Bucs visited Walter Reed before the game to mingle with the patients, with the group consisting of several coaches and players Stew, S-Rod, Trevo and Steven Brault.
Derek Jeter fired several more Marlin honchos, including pitch doctor Jim Benedict who was pirated from Pittsburgh in 2015; the Fish sent Trevo here as compensation. We wouldn’t worry too much about Benedict, though; he’ll land on his feet and quickly. The new bosses also canned Marc DelPiano, who left Pittsburgh about the same time to become the Miami overlord of player development. Mike Berger, a Central Catholic HS grad and Oakmont resident who was the assistant GM was also deep-sixed.

In it, he questioned the President's patriotism, criticized his policies and ridiculed his campaign promises . It ended with a challenge to his own fans, saying 'You're either for or against.'
Here's the freestyle in full.

""It's the calm before the storm right here
Wait, how was I gonna start this off?
I forgot... oh, yeah
That's an awfully hot coffee pot
Should I drop it on Donald Trump? Probably not
But that's all I got 'til I come up with a solid plot
Got a plan and now I gotta hatch it
Like a damn Apache with a tomahawk
Imma walk inside a mosque on Ramadan
And say a prayer that every time Melania talks
She gets a mou... Ahh, Imma stop
But we better give Obama props
'Cause what we got in office now's a kamikaze
That'll probably cause a nuclear holocaust
And while the drama pops
And he waits for s**t to quiet down, he'll just gas his plane up and fly around 'til the bombing stops
Intensities heightened, tensions are risin'
Trump, when it comes to giving a s**t, you're stingy as I am
Except when it comes to having the b***s to go against me, you hide 'em
'Cause you don't got the f**king n**s like an empty asylum
Racism's the only thing he's fantastic for
'Cause that's how he gets his f**king rocks off and he's orange
Yeah, sick tan
That's why he wants us to disband
'Cause he cannot withstand
The fact we're not afraid of Trump
F**k walkin' on egg shells, I came to stomp
That's why he keeps screamin' 'Drain the swamp'
'Cause he's in quicksand
It's like we take a step forwards, then backwards
But this is his form of distraction
Plus, he gets an enormous reaction
When he attacks the NFL so we focus on that
Instead of talking Puerto Rico or gun reform for Nevada
All these horrible tragedies and he's bored and would rather
Cause a Twitter storm with the Packers
Then says he wants to lower our taxes
Then who's gonna pay for his extravagant trips
Back and forth with his fam to his golf resorts and his mansions?
Same s**t that he tormented Hillary for and he slandered
Then does it more
From his endorsement of Bannon
Support for the Klansmen
Tiki torches in hand for the soldier that's black
And comes home from Iraq
And is still told to go back to Africa
Fork and a dagger in this racist 94-year-old grandpa
Who keeps ignoring our past historical, deplorable factors
Now if you're a black athlete, you're a spoiled little brat for
Tryina use your platform or your stature
To try to give those a voice who don't have one
He says, 'You're spittin' in the face of vets who fought for us, you bastards!'
Unless you're a POW who's tortured and battered
'Cause to him you're zeros
'Cause he don't like his war heroes captured
That's not disrespecting the military
F**k that! This is for Colin, ball up a fist!
And keep that s**t balled like Donald the b**ch!
'He's gonna get rid of all immigrants!'
'He's gonna build that thang up taller than this!'
Well, if he does build it, I hope it's rock solid with bricks
'Cause like him in politics, I'm using all of his tricks
'Cause I'm throwin' that piece of s**t against the wall 'til it sticks
And any fan of mine who's a supporter of his
I'm drawing in the sand a line: you're either for or against
And if you can't decide who you like more and you're split
On who you should stand beside, I'll do it for you with this:
F**k you!
The rest of America stand up
We love our military, and we love our country
But we f**king hate Trump""",fake
3030,The Pharmaceutical Menace Promoted As Prophylactic Medicine,"By Catherine J. Frompovich
The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) of the World Health Organization generated some information in 2014, subsequently republished online by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, which was titled “Disclosures of interests”—“Primary End-points for Prophylactic HPV Vaccine Trials.”
Several entries sort of “stand out” for various reasons:
Dr Douglas Lowy reports that as part of his United States government-supported research at the National Cancer Institute (NCI)/National Institutes of Health (NIH), he is an inventor of technology that underlies the L1-based prophylactic virus-like particle (VLP) HPV vaccine and technology that underlies an L2-based candidate prophylactic HPV vaccine. The NIH has licensed the technology for the L1 VLP vaccine to Merck, the manufacturer of Gardasil, to GlaxoSmithKline, the manufacturer of Cervarix, and to Indian Immunologicals Ltd. The L2-based vaccine technology is the subject of a cooperative research and development agreement between the NCI, Johns Hopkins University, and Shantha Biotech, and has been licensed to Shantha, PanVax, Acambis Inc., and GlaxoSmithKline. United States Federal law entitles Dr Lowy to a limited share of royalties the NIH receives for these technologies . Dr Joel Palefsky reports that his research unit at the University of California, San Francisco benefited from research funding from Merck and Hologic; Dr Palefsky reports that he benefited from support for travel from Merck; Dr Palefsky reports that he has received honoraria for a research presentation at Qiagen; Dr Palefsky reports that he testified on behalf of Merck on the vaccine efficacy in males. Dr John Schiller reports that as part of his United States government-supported research at the National Cancer Institute (NCI)/National Institutes of Health (NIH), he is an inventor of technology that underlies the L1-based prophylactic virus-like particle (VLP) HPV vaccine and technology that underlies an L2-based candidate prophylactic HPV vaccine. The NIH has licensed the technology for the L1 VLP vaccine to Merck, the manufacturer of Gardasil, to GlaxoSmithKline, the manufacturer of Cervarix, and to Indian Immunologicals Ltd. The L2-based vaccine technology is the subject of a cooperative research and development agreement between the NCI, Johns Hopkins University, and Shantha Biotech, and has been licensed to Shantha, PanVax, Acambis Inc., and GlaxoSmithKline. United States Federal law entitles Dr Schiller to a limited share of royalties the NIH receives for these technologies . Dr Margaret Stanley reports that she received personal consultancy fees from Sanofi Pasteur MSD, GlaxoSmithKline, and MSD ; Dr Stanley reports that she received personal speaker’s fees from MSD.
One has to wonder just how much the above “interests” can, and do, influence either the science or ‘propaganda’ generated by pharmaceutical companies in their zealous promotion of the very dangerous HPV vaccines being promoted for various ‘health reasons’ when first they were promoted as “preventing cervical cancer in young women.” Now boys, who don’t have cervixes, are mandated to receive them too.
The Australia Connection
In Australia there is a current ‘war of words’ going on regarding all mandatory vaccines, and in particular the HPV vaccine, between citizens and the Aussie government’s “No Jab No Pay” mandatory vaccine policy with groups like “No Jab No Pay No Way” stating:
NO WAY! – to pressuring or forcing injections that can cause serious medical conditions, even death! (Ab)using its power from needy families’ dependence, the Government threatens to withhold needed funds to PRESSURE OR FORCE 20 thousands of parents to allow their children to be directly injected and, by its own admission after only very limited testing3, with ALL of… 86 antigen doses: 8 injections (74 antigen doses) before 12 months of age, and 2 more injections by 4 years of age.4 plus foreign organism components, neurotoxins and multiple chemicals: such as aborted foetal & animal cell line components & DNA, aluminium, polysorbate 805, genetically engineered yeast, MSG, antibiotics and potentially animal viruses and/or other contaminants.6 Source
The factual irony of the “No Jab No Pay” policy is that it truly is unconstitutional in principle, as two countries now have stated mandatory and coercive vaccination policies (which Australia’s definitely is because government welfare benefits are attached) are unconstitutional. Those countries are Sweden in Europe and Colombia in South America.
As the “No Jab No Pay No Way” website clearly and legally asserts:
NO WAY! – to disregarding inalienable human rights!…. Individuals have inalienable rights to life, bodily security, equality, and free exercise of thought, conscience and religion. Provisions for these rights are NOT “loopholes”. They are expressed in the Constitution, common and statute law and international human rights instruments .19 Accordingly, the High Court (1949) has ruled that “any form” or “extent” of “compulsion” of medical services, “whether legal, by… penalties, or… by any other means, direct or indirect, could not be authorized .’20 So whatever ‘law’ the Government enacts, vaccination will remain illegal unless parents give valid consent . The Government itself instructs that consent to vaccination is valid only if given:- “voluntarily in the absence of undue pressure, coercion or manipulation” AND “after the potential risks and benefits of the… vaccine, risks of not having it and any alternative options have been explained” .21 Otherwise vaccination may constitute battery, negligence, malpractice, professional misconduct and/or fraud by the administrator . [CJF emphasis] Source
However, Australian health officials and all healthcare consumers there need to factor into the “No Jab No Pay” brouhaha going on, somethings that probably can influence changing the disregard for denying inalienable human rights: vested corporate interests and marketing plans on the part of vaccine manufacturers, their subsidized scientists and public relations mouthpieces, i.e., doctors Pharma financially support and provide gratuities to. In Australia one such individual, according to the IARC list, is
Dr Suzanne Garland reports that her unit at the Royal Women’s Hospital benefited from research funding from CSL, Merck, and GlaxoSmithKline; Dr Garland reports benefiting from personal speaker’s fees and support for travel from CSL, Merck, Sanofi Pasteur, and GlaxoSmithKline. [CJF emphasis]
Don’t CSL [1], Merck and GlaxoSmithKline provide HPV vaccines in Australia?
Is Australia so ‘hung up’ on pushing the HPV vaccines because it was “Australian research technology” and “CSL has the exclusive right to market in Australia and New Zealand any Merck HPV vaccine developed using CSL’s technology.” [1]
Here’s CSL (Australian Pharma Company) role in the HPV vaccine:
CSL chief scientific officer Andrew Cuthbertson said Merck expected to apply for a licence for the HPV vaccine in the second half of 2005, following extensive Phase III trials. “We’re very excited about this project, not just because we believe it is commercially important for CSL. “I think from an Australian science point of view, this is terribly important.” Dr Cuthbertson said CSL had not released any information in relation to milestone payments linked to the HPV vaccine or to potential royalties from sales. The vaccine could be on the market about 12 months after gaining regulatory approval. Dr Cuthbertson said Merck expected to be the first to sell the vaccine, under the trademark Gardasil, in the major markets of the United States and the European Union. The initial target group would be women aged 19 to 24, of which there were 60 to 70 million in the US and Europe. Merck was carrying out studies on vaccinating women aged 25 to 45, which comprised about 100 million women in the US and Europe, Dr Cuthbertson said. [1]
Now, let’s juxtapose the article “Ten years on, Professor Ian Frazer recalls ‘lucky’ discovery of cervical cancer vaccine” against the following devastating information about HPV vaccines adverse reactions from countries around the globe, which Australia and the USA both need to consider seriously and at least make HPV vaccines not mandatory, but voluntary. Voluntary status for those who either don’t know the real science behind the HPV vaccines or those who think HPV vaccines may be helpful truly IS the constitutional way to go, as opposed to the totalitarian way now being forced on adolescents and their parents.

NO! Why not? Shouldn’t that be legally mandated with vaccinees signatures giving consent required as part of vaccination protocols anywhere in the world, starting with Australia and the USA?
Another medical-legal protocol which must be instituted and enforced is this: When anyone under 21 years of age dies, a complete record of their vaccinations with DATES administered must become part of the autopsy report and medical review before issuance of a death certificate.

Nevertheless there are legitimate concerns that should be addressed: (1) long-term ovarian function was not assessed in either the original rat safety studies3,4 or in the human vaccine trials, (2) most primary care physicians are probably unaware of a possible association between HPV4 and POF [premature ovarian failure] and may not consider reporting POF cases or prolonged amenorrhea (missing menstrual periods) to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), (3) potential mechanisms of action have been postulated based on autoimmune associations with the aluminum adjuvant used1 and previously documented ovarian toxicity in rats from another component, polysorbate 80,2 and (4) since licensure of Gardasil® in 2006, there have been about 213 VAERS reports (per the publicly available CDC WONDER VAERS database) involving amenorrhea, POF or premature menopause, 88% of which have been associated with Gardasil.5 The twostrain HPV2, Cervarix TM, was licensed late in 2009 and accounts for 4.7 % of VAERS amenorrhea reports since 2006, and 8.5% of those reports from February 2010 through May 2015. This compares to the pre-HPV vaccine period from 1990 to 2006 during which no cases of POF or premature menopause and 32 cases of amenorrhea were reported to VAERS.
Dr. Sin Hang Lee, MD, Director of the Milford Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory, Milford, Connecticut, wrote a 16-page open-letter-of-complaint to Dr. Margaret Chan, Director-General of the World Health Organization, regarding misleading safety information about the two HPV vaccines, Gardasil® and Cervarix®, another important document to study.
Dr. Diane Harper, MD, one of the original researchers on the HPV vaccine spoke out and
…agrees with Merck and the CDC that Gardasil is safe for most girls and women. But she says the side effects reported so far call for more complete disclosure to patients. She says they should be told that protection from the vaccination might not last long enough to provide a cancer protection benefit , and that its risks – “small but real” – could occur more often than the cervical cancer itself would. “ Parents and women must know that deaths occurred . Not all deaths that have been reported were represented in Dr. Slade’s work, one-third of the death reports were unavailable to the CDC, leaving the parents of the deceased teenagers in despair that the CDC is ignoring the very rare but real occurrences that need not have happened if parents were given information stating that there are real, but small risks of death surrounding the administration of Gardasil.” She also worries that Merck’s aggressive marketing of the vaccine may have given women a false sense of security. [2] [CJF emphasis]
All the above about the HPV vaccines would lead any thinking person to wonder why such a ‘pig-in-a-poke’ is being mandated and forced on to adolescent children and their parents for compliance.
Is it a question of “follow the money”?

The Jets were granted a roster exemption for wide receiver Jalin Marshall but it looks like they’ve made a move that will clear the way for his return by cutting ties with tight end Neal Sterling. A local product, Sterling was singed after being let go by the Jacksonville Jaguars and had just one catch for 8 yards.
The Jets have waived TE Neal Sterling. His roster spot could be used for WR Jalin Marshall. It also means rookie… https://t.co/JR7p99iJjK — Rich Cimini (@RichCimini) October 5, 2017
If Marshall is added to the roster and made active, it will give the Jets two very similar receivers in Marshall and Jeremy Kerley, with rookie Ardarius Stewart also competing for reps. Marshall had a down rookie season after grabbing headlines in the preseason for making one outstanding catch after another. He would finish 2016 with just 14 receptions for 162 yards and a pair of touchdowns.
Despite the lack of production, head coach Todd Bowles didn’t appear to lose any faith in the promising receiver, getting him plenty of work as the team’s third receiver in training camp even with his four game suspension looming.
It looks like Marshall has been working overtime to keep himself in shape if he does in fact get the call.

By Rich Mitchell -
President Donald Trump called Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer Friday to see if Democrats would be willing to work out a deal to replace Obama’s failing healthcare law. Schumer (D-NY) told him that doing so is “off the table.” Americans are suffering under the oppressive premium increases and terrible healthcare plans Obamacare has thrust upon them. Families have had to switch to doctors they don’t want and pay premiums they can’t afford just to get deductibles so high they end up paying out-of-pocket for just about everything – basically its expensive insurance that doesn’t work. The House of Representatives passed a replacement bill earlier this year but the Senate has been unable to get anything done on health care. Therefore, President Trump offered Democrats a chance to fix their awful health care plan. Mr. Trump said he asked Schumer if Democrats “want to do a great health care bill,” because Obamacare is “badly broken.” I called Chuck Schumer yesterday to see if the Dems want to do a great HealthCare Bill. ObamaCare is badly broken, big premiums. Who knows! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 7, 2017 But Democrats aren’t open to cooperating on health care, something Schumer said he …

A few notes, thoughts and links to previous articles on Gang Green to pass along:
It’s not exactly time to put anyone in Canton after just three games, but the play of the Jets’ rookie safeties have been extremely impressive through two games, especially in coverage. Jamal Adams hasn’t allowed a completion since week one and PFF provided this stat on fellow rookie Marcus Maye earlier today
Marcus Maye played 46 coverage snaps against MIA. He wasn’t targeted once. On the season: 107 cov snaps, 3 targets, 29 yds allowed #Jets — PFF NY Jets (@PFF_NYJets) September 25, 2017
As much as Jets fans knock the play of Matt Forte, he has outperformed Bilal Powell over the past two games, averaging 4.6 yards per carry to Powell’s 2.4. Rookie running back Elijah McGuire has posted an average of 4.8 YPC during that same time period.
You have to tip your cap to Leonard Williams and the rest of the defensive line for an incredible effort on Sunday. There may not have been big sack numbers, but the unit did pressure Jay Cutler while holding Jay Ajayi to 16 yards on 11 carries. Even Mo Wilkerson, who had just one tackle, looked better than he has all season.
If for no other reason, those fans who can attend this week’s game against the Jaguars should do so to honor the great Kevin Mawae, who will be inducted in to the team’s ring of honor.
More important than just getting a win this past Sunday was the fact that so many of the Jets’ young players stood out on both sides of the ball. Take a look at our list here .
. If Brian Winters misses any more time and Dakota Dozier continues to play well in his place, it’s not a good look for Mike Maccagnan who gave Winters a huge contract this off season to avoid having Winters hit free agency.
Defensive lineman Lawrence Thomas got some run at fullback on Sunday.
Defensive lineman Lawrence Thomas played a bit of fullback against the Dolphins, and if you’re wondering if he may see a carry from time to time, it appears unlikely as the Michigan State Spartans used him exclusively as a blocker and receiver in his one season out of the backfield for the Spartans. But….never say never.
For the third week in a row, outside linebacker Jordan Jenkins turned in an impressive performance and seems to have picked up where he left off last season. The same can’t be said for Juston Burris who played well in the opener, but has struggled since.
After facing Marshawn Lynch and Jay Ajayi in back-to-back weeks, it won’t get any easier for the Jets defense as they prepare to take on rookie battering ram Leonard Fournette. After an incredible performance against the Dolphins (11 solo tackles, 3 tackles for loss), Demario Davis and his partner in crime, Darron Lee, may be tested up the middle once again.
Only five days ’til game day, folks!

252,Las Vegas Massacre: Thought Provoking – ‘No Conclusive Evidence or Information About This Shooting’,"(Before It's News)
 
 
 
 
By John W. Spring
Emigrate While You Still Can! Learn More...
 
The Las Vegas Massacre, which had occurred on October 1, 2017 and caused at least 58 people to die and more than 500 persons to become injured, is the worst shooting tragedy to occur since the Wounded Knee Creek Massacre on December 29, 1890 when U.S. Calvary troops were sent to disarm the Lakota Indians in South Dakota that caused the deaths of 150 Native Americans and had wounded 51 men, women and children. The destruction of the Lakota Pine Ridge Indian Reservation by U.S. Army soldiers may have caused the death toll to rise to at least 300 Native Americans because their living quarters, warm clothing, and food supplies no longer existed.
 
Just as every previous event or tragedy in America has never revealed the entire truth, in such a short period of time it seems as if so little information has been released to the public and most of that so-called news seems to be rather uncertain. For instance, when law enforcement agents in Las Vegas were reported entering Room 32135 on the 32nd hotel floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, they claimed to have found the dead body of Steven Paddock who allegedly was the lone shooter with an arsenal of long rifles and a multitude of ammunition magazines. It is hard to imagine that MGM Resorts International would have such inadequate security in this remodeled hotel bearing its name. However, by contrast, we are led to believe that Paddock had installed his own security cameras leading into the hallway to warn him before anyone’s arrival.
 
At this time, we have not received any conclusive evidence or information about this shooting. If we did, perhaps it might turn out that his dead body had been left in Room 32135 after a series of fully-automatic “shooting machine guns” had been removed and only AR-15 semi-automatic gun types were displayed in an attempt to convince the public this defensive rifle must be banned.
 
All we really know at this time is that at least 58 wonderful men, women and children have died and more than 500 other Americans were wounded by an undisclosed weapon apparently fired at a location from the Mandalay Bay in a room on the 32nd floor of the hotel. But it has also become rather clear that our Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution is being threatened by so many well-organized members of various Marxist groups and leftist factions of the news media who now intend to cause violence against us, the American people, after they are able to remove the only effective means for self-defense. Take a good look at Europe in terms of self-protection. It no longer exists in any European household except to some extent in Switzerland.",credible

110,The Shocking Carol Woods Coverup: POLICE ALTER RECORDS + archive 11 Sept. 2017,"(Before It's News)
Now I have the police records 11 Sept 17
Dear all sent this, I do not send all emails often as I know people have their own troubles. This though I want you all to know because without your support at the crucial time anything could have happened to me.
After YEARS of trying to get a Section 7 Subject Access Request under the DPA 1998 Amended 2000, via Lancashire police, it still needed, even after I paid my £10 and took the 60 miles round trip to hand in my ID, the ICO involvement TWICE and now I have data they claimed did not exist.
Among that I consider the wrongful arrest and false imprisonment, illegal detention of me from Nov 2015 to March 2016 with the threat of arrest as soon as I was released from The Orchard.
The paperwork has all been changed.
The custody records of 7/8/ Nov 2015 I had to get a solicitor to help me obtain them as AGAIN the Gestapo ignored all my requests, faxed or otherwise. It was the first custody record I have ever managed to get and that was the help of a solicitor who would accept no money. His firm had been duty solicitors that night of Nov 2015 and NOT told I was arrested and asking for a solicitor. I was deprived of that basic right as usual. He was intrigued. (Incidentally when his firm wrote to me about the arrest of Feb 2012, delivered to 298 Oxcliffe Rd when I rented caravan 1A in Aug 2012, the roughneck Diane Lennon was alerted and she one to pose as me, called to 298 and claimed MY mail freely handed to her by the landlady. When I found out and told the firm they wrote again and that also “disappeared”. I gave up.)
I could see when analysing the data that details were incorrect and the FACTS had been recorded wrongly with INTENT. The odd thing then was they claimed they had no names of 3 “NHS professionals” in the station who “sectioned me”. There were other deliberately incorrect details but that is what I add here for you all.
In my Sec 7 SAR, AFTER the Gestapo were sent my analysis of how the custody record was totally false, they obviously decided to revise it. Now they don’t even refer to LES MARSHALL who was used as apparently the proof I was mentally ill was that I could not recall speaking to him for about 2 hours. No, I said, I did not forget, I stated I had never heard of him, seen him, spoken to him at all. The NHS confirmed Marshall had not worked for them in Nov 2015, was not in the police station and had not worked for them for years. But see how proof of my stating that was “proof” I was mentally ill.
Then more but the 3 on documents I have WERE NOT IN THE POLICE STATION THAT NIGHT AS I SAID ALL ALONG BUT NO ONE WOULD LISTEN. IT WAS EASY ENOUGH TO FIND OUT. I found out but after I was released.
What about the arrests: 1) “following someone to a local airport” aside from the fact we don’t have one – deleted from the records. 2) “harassing an 83 year old woman” (how was not stated) when I don’t know any – deleted from the records. 3) “taking photos of children” – deleted from the records. 4) “following someone to Kendal” no date, no person named,- deleted from the records. 5) “Someone (unnamed) had an injunction ordering me not to write to them” so as I pointed out the lunacy in that was that a person who did not know me went to the expense of going to court to ask for an injunction against me so I would not write to her (I am sure HER was referred to) as if a judge would do that! The solicitor I went to see to help me get the custody records made enquiries about that; there was never any injunction at all as he was sure there could not be on such drivel.
The latest “custody record” now has a NEW solicitor named as being on duty that night, one from Preston. AND THAT SHEET OF PAPER HAS MY SIGNATURE AS IF I HAD SEEN IT AND SIGNED. My signature is a photocopied one from the one the solicitor obtained for me. And on those custody records, there is no “south Lancaster” solicitor named at all; it is northern division.
And for those who still think I make things up then they have to conceded that my documents are scotch mist.
But for all of you who rang and made noises, you were right, I was right, they were wrong. Carol.
PS on a cheerful note, the Gestapo records show how they raised FOR POLICE EYES ONLY incident numbers for my “serious crimes” not exposed. One was “She has written to the Crime Commissioner”. I kid you not, there it is in black and white and other such utter rubbish.

2225,Deepwater Horizon Gulf Oil Spill And The Corexit Oil Dispersant Health Problems Confirmed,"By Catherine J. Frompovich
Back on April 20, 2010, a major environmental catastrophe occurred in the Gulf of Mexico when the Deepwater Horizon oil drilling rig exploded and 4.9 million barrels of crude spilled into the Gulf waters creating a problem that was not ‘fixed’ until July 10, 2010 when the rig finally was able to be capped.
One of the approved emergency methods to control the oil spill was the use of Corexit™, a chemical dispersant sprayed from aircraft. According to a report about the health issues related to that chemical “Respiratory, Dermal, and Eye Irritation Symptoms Associated with Corexit™ EC9527A/EC9500A following the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill: Findings from the GuLF STUDY,” we learn in the Introduction,
As part of the oil spill response and cleanup (OSRC), approximately 1.8 million gallons (6.8 million liters) of oil dispersant was applied both to the sea surface [1.07 million gallons (4.05 million liters)] and directly into the stream of oil leaving the wellhead 5,000 feet (1.5 km) underwater [0.77 million gallons (2.9 million liters)] (United States Coast Guard 2011).
Furthermore, in the Conclusion of that report, association is made that health issues apparently were caused by the dispersant chemical.
Potential exposure to Corexit™ EC9527A or EC9500A was associated with a range of health symptoms at the time of the OSRC, as well as at the time of study enrollment, 1–3 y after the spill. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP1677
Table 2 of the report cites the following health issues:
Cough; Wheeze; Tightness in chest; Shortness of breath; Burning in nose, throat, lungs; Burning eyes; Itching eyes; Skin Irritation.
The above report confirms what clean-up crew members were reporting at the time of the incident and thereafter. However, what long-range health problems do they face? Man-made toxic chemicals are known to cause irreparable DNA breaks, which lead to cancers.
The truly IRONIC part about all the above is what a judge ruled regarding lawsuits filed about Corexit exposure and health problems:
Law360, Los Angeles (November 30, 2012, 6:19 PM EST) — A Louisiana federal judge on Tuesday dismissed personal injury lawsuits against chemical maker Nalco over the use of its oil dispersant Corexit after the 2010 Deepwater Horizon spill, ruling that federal authority to clean up oil spills preempted injury claims by workers and residents. In a 36-page decision on Tuesday granting Nalco’s motion for summary judgment, U.S. District Judge Carl J. Barbier of New Orleans, who oversees the multidistrict litigation concerning the oil disaster, ruled that claims for exposure-related injuries were barred by the Clean Water Act and the National Contingency Plan. Source
Perhaps first responders and clean-up crews ought to consider the short- and long-range ramifications and personal injury possibilities they can encounter and be exposed to regarding any type of disasters they are sent in to remediate and even refuse going, especially when legal deprivations like what happened in this case:
But Judge Barbier ruled that if he were to permit the plaintiffs’ claims, “then, during the next substantial spill or ‘spill of national significance,’ the threat of liability might cause the manufacturer of dispersant X to refuse to provide its product, even though the FOSC determined that dispersant X should be used.” Ecolab, a water, hygiene and energy technology business that is the parent company of Nalco, expressed gratification with Tuesday’s decision. Source
Isn’t there something inherently wrong with the legal system in the USA when a judge rules not to permit plaintiffs’ claims to proceed when plaintiffs are damaged cleaning up a disaster?
Shouldn’t the federal government then be responsible legally for making damaged plaintiffs whole?
Doesn’t that Corexit ruling somehow remind us of what Congress did to protect vaccine makers from product liability lawsuits too?
Remember what happened to first responders on 9/11 [1], including deliberate lies [2] told about how safe the air was?
Who is going to take care of first responders’ safety and wellbeing health issues resulting from dangerous and dramatic events like terrorism, chemical spills and whatever man-made disasters may be in our future?

2461,"Kenya police use teargas, shoot in air during opposition march","Supporters of the opposition National Super Alliance (NASA) coalition, carry banners and react during a protest calling for the sacking of election board officials involved in August's cancelled presidential vote, in Nairobi, Kenya October 9, 2017. REUTERS/Thomas Mukoya
NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenyan police fired teargas and shots in the air on Monday as hundreds of demonstrators marched through the capital Nairobi to protest against proposed legal changes that would make it harder for the Supreme Court to annul an election.
Reuters television footage showed a sport utility vehicle ploughing into some of the protesters, severely injuring three, but it was not immediately clear who was responsible and the police made no immediate comment on the incident.
Kenya is due on Oct. 26 to repeat a presidential election after the Supreme Court nullified an Aug. 8 vote due to procedural irregularities. President Uhuru Kenyatta, who won the August election, will face opposition leader Raila Odinga.
Uncertainty over the coming election has created turmoil in the East African nation, which is a regional trade hub and staunch Western ally.
As the demonstrators marched toward the election board in Nairobi, a Reuters journalist saw men in plain clothes near security forces fire shots in the air. Police on horseback set up blockades to prevent protesters from accessing some roads.
Police also used teargas in the western city of Kisumu, Odinga’s stronghold, to disperse protesters, though another demonstration in the coastal city of Mombasa passed peacefully.
Odinga’s opposition alliance is threatening to boycott the October vote unless the electoral board changes some personnel - a stance he declined on Monday to clarify, in comments that suggested he was keeping his options open for now.
“This is a democratic society we live in. If I choose not to participate in the pre-rigged election process, it is my democratic right. No court can order me to do so,” Odinga said in comments broadcast on Kenyan TV stations, without elaborating further.

“DECLARING WAR”
The protesters want to warn ruling party lawmakers not to pass an amendment to the election law that would limit the circumstances in which the Supreme Court could void an election on procedural grounds, opposition lawmaker James Orengo said.
“If parliament passes the law tomorrow, it will be like declaring war on the Kenyan people,” he said.

REUTERS/Thomas Mukoya
Justin Muturi, speaker of the National Assembly, said the amendment could be debated when parliament reconvenes on Tuesday if lawmakers were keen to push it forward.
He said the key part of the proposed law stipulates that if a candidate boycotts an election whose date has already been set, the remaining candidate would win the contest without formal polls being held.
The government is keen to avoid a constitutional crisis if Odinga pulls out at the last minute, frustrating the court’s order to hold elections within 60 days, Muturi said.
“We are trying to prevent a crisis should there be no elections,” he told Reuters by phone.
The government-backed Kenya National Commission on Human Rights said on Monday in a report that at least 37 people had been killed in a police crackdown on protests that immediately followed the August vote - the highest death toll given so far.
The report attributed some deaths to “police using live bullets and a few from police bludgeoning using clubs”. It named a 6-month-old baby girl, a 7-year-old boy, and an 8-year-old girl as being among the victims.

1214,"From Tipper to Trump, Eminem is no stranger to political criticism","(CNN) Eminem's freestyle rap aggressively taking on President Donald Trump and his supporters at the BET Hip Hop Awards on Tuesday was his most vocal criticism yet of this president.
But not of any president.
Over the course of his Grammy-winning career, the combative rapper has used his music to start feuds with celebrities, artists, the media and plenty of politicians.
Eminem was a fierce critic of President George W. Bush, particularly in the blistering anti-Iraq War song ""Mosh,"" and was once investigated by the Secret Service for rapping that he wished the President would die. His violent, aggressive, misogynistic and anti-gay lyrics even sparked hearings in Congress.
Never afraid to speak his mind or cause controversy, Eminem has variously slammed Bill and Hillary Clinton, Lynne Cheney, Tipper Gore and scores of other politicians he saw as hypocritical leaders.
Here's a look back at Eminem's most memorable dips into politics and political criticism.
Anti-Iraq War and Bush lyrics
Eminem, whose real name is Marshall Mathers, intensely criticized Bush's Iraq War policies in his protest song ""Mosh"" in October 2004. The song called on people to ""rebel"" and ""raise hell"" in protest and called out Bush personally.
""Stomp, push, shove, mush. F*** Bush. Until they bring our troops home, come on,"" he raps.
The third verse featured further criticisms and suggested Bush fight the war himself.
""Let the President answer a higher anarchy. Strap him with an AK-47, let him go fight his own war, let him impress daddy that way. No more blood for oil, we got our own battles to fight on our own soil,"" he says.
He further tells his listeners to ""look in his eyes, it's all lies. The stars and stripes have been swiped, washed out and wiped, and replaced with his own face.""
In case the lyrics weren't clear, an accompanying video further expressed his political message. The video featured images of Bush as well as protesters in black sweatshirts storming the US Capitol.
At one point, an animated Eminem looks at a wall of newspaper articles with headlines such as ""Bush Knew."" Another headline reads ""President Bush Signs Patriot Act,"" but with the word Patriot crossed out and replaced with the word ""DEATH.""
In an interview with Rolling Stone in 2004, he said Bush ""started a mess"" and had ""f***ed up so bad"" in going to war.
""[Bush] has been painted to be this hero, and he's got our troops over there dying for no reason,"" he said.
""We got young people over there dyin', kids in their teens, early twenties that should have futures ahead of them. And for what? It seems like a Vietnam 2. Bin Laden attacked us, and we attacked Saddam. Explain why that is. Give us some answers.""
Secret Service investigation
Eminem was once actually investigated by the Secret Service. A lyric in his song ""We Are American"" talks about the president, which was Bush at the time.
""F*** money. I don't rap for dead presidents. I'd rather see the President dead,"" he says.
That line led to the Secret Service investigation, which is routine when something that appears to threaten the president is brought to agents' attention.
""It would be saying too much to make too big a deal out of this,"" one Secret Service official told CNN at the time
Lynne Cheney and Tipper Gore
Eminem has often played up his fights with those in power as a point of pride.
That led to a rebuttal in the song ""White America"" from 2002, in which Eminem proudly says he's ""in trouble with the government"" for his lyrics.
""I must have struck a chord with somebody up in the office, cause Congress keeps telling me I ain't causing nothing but problems. And now they're saying I'm in trouble with the government. I'm lovin' it, I shoveled s*** all my life, and now I'm dumping it on,"" he raps.
In the final section of the song, Eminem unloads on Cheney as well as Tipper Gore, the wife of Vice President Al Gore. Tipper Gore co-founded the Parents Music Resource Center known for its ""Parental Advisory"" stickers.
""(I am) the ringleader of this circus of worthless pawns sent to lead the march right up to the steps of Congress, and p**s on the lawns of the White House, to burn the ​​flag​​ and replace it with a Parental Advisory sticker, to spit liquor in the faces of this democracy of hypocrisy,"" he raps.
He continues in personal language.
""F*** you, Ms. Cheney! F*** you, Tipper Gore! F*** you with the freest of speech this Divided States of Embarrassment will allow me to have. F*** you!""
Trump: 'Slim Shady is a winner'
Eminem's politics have sometimes trended more toward satire than anger. In an odd TV special back in 2004, Slim Shady led the ""Shady National Convention,"" a fake political convention hosted by Carson Daly and Vanessa Lachey.
A suit-wearing Slim Shady accepted the nomination for the ""Shady Party and Stuff."" But before he did that, the rapper was introduced by none other than Donald Trump, then known more for his wealth than his political skills.
""When the Shady Party called and told me there's going to be a convention, I said it's gotta be a really big one and it's gotta be right here in New York, because this is the best city anywhere in the world, am I right?"" Trump said. ""Of course I'm right. I'm always right. I'm Donald Trump, I'm always right.""
""I know a winner when I see one. And Donald Trump is telling you right now Slim Shady is a winner,"" he added. ""He's got brains, he's got guts, and he's got Donald Trump's vote.""
Eminem then took the stage and explained his reasons for running as a candidate, tongue firmly in cheek.
""Why me, you ask? Why Eminem? Well, let me tell you why if you would shut up for one second. Democrats and Republicans alike, and that other guy, they had conventions and they looked cooler than this one, but so what? So what, I say to them.
""What am I running for, you ask? I don't run from anything,"" he said. ""That's the thing. I tackle the issues head on.""
Bill and Hillary Clinton
In his song ""Role Model"" on The Slim Shady LP in 1999, Eminem raps about then-President Bill Clinton and First Lady Hillary Clinton.
""So if I said I never did drugs, that would mean I lie and get f***ed more than the President does,"" he says.
Eminem, who has often been criticized for violent, misogynistic and anti-gay language , then attacks Hillary Clinton.
""Hilary Clinton tried to slap me and call me a pervert. I ripped her f***ing tonsils out and fed her sherbet -- b****,"" he raps.",fake

1273,Adding Words To Syrian Witness' Statement To Fit Western Narrative,"By Brandon Turbeville
Although the entirety of the Western corporate media machine is worthy of the name “Fake News,” CNN has become the standard bearer of the title. It seems that the organization is doing everything in its power to earn its position as the tip of the spear in the army of “fake news.” Indeed, it is scarcely possible to keep up with the lies, deceit, and half-truths CNN presents to the general public on a daily basis. Occasionally, however, one instance stands out so much that it cannot be allowed to slip by without being addressed.
Back in 2016, as Aleppo was the scene of a fierce battle between America’s terrorist forces and the Syrian military, CNN broadcasted a report from Jibrin, Syria where it purported to show the sad state of civilians fleeing the war that had come to Aleppo. The clip shows two Syrians – one young boy and an older man – who are telling the reporter about their situation.
The CNN reporter predictably attributes the horrors facing the civilians as a result of the eastern part of Aleppo “being under siege by the Syrian military,” not the fact that terrorists had seized east Aleppo and were fighting to the death to keep it. Still he quotes an older man who paints a less than typical CNN-style portrayal of the “rebels.” The man says, “I wanted to leave with my kids fifteen days ago but the rebels shot at me and said ‘Hey you bastard! Do you want to join the regime?’”
The only thing surprising about the man’s statement was that it was actually aired on CNN.
However, the most interesting aspect of the report is what was attributed to the young boy whom CNN quotes as saying, “We were afraid that we would starve to death. We were also scared because heavy bombs were falling.”
This quote makes the boy seem as if he is worried because of the Syrian military’s bombs. However, the translation is not only inaccurate, the second half is completely fabricated. The boy’s actual statement is “We were afraid that we would starve to death. We were afraid that we would starve to death.” Even to a non-Arabic speaker, one can clearly hear that the boy is merely repeating his first statement a second time. He says nothing about bombs. CNN simply added it to the translation for political and propaganda purposes.
While civilians on the ground were no doubt worried about the bombs of the Syrian military (bombs kill regardless of who drops them) they were even more afraid of living under the unimaginable tyranny of America’s terrorists. Still, CNN has gone much further than simply bending the truth to fit a narrative, it has obviously told a complete and total lie. It has put words in the mouths of its interview subjects and passed it off as the truth. At best, this is a violation of journalistic ethics. More realistic, however, it is an act of willful deceit and an attempt to mold the minds of the general public for political purposes.
At this point, CNN cannot be taken seriously as even a second rate news organization. It is clearly nothing more than a propaganda mouthpiece for State Department and other interests. Unfortunately for CNN, even operating as a propaganda organ, it is only second rate.

2255,Streaming Defenses (2017): Week 5: Which Offense Do We Want To Exploit?,"Streaming Defenses (2017): Week 5: Which Offense Do We Want To Exploit?
(Before It's News)
by Eric Stashin (aka The Rotoprofessor)
Things are constantly changing in the NFL, and what we knew at the time of our drafts is already “out of date” and irrelevant three weeks into the season though we are starting to get a grasp of the offenses we should look to pick on. With that in mind, which defenses that were likely ignored on draft day are worth considering for Week 5? Let’s take a look:
New York Jets – at Cleveland
CBS Sports – 5%, ESPN – 1.3%
The Jets’ defense has been performing well as of late, and while you may want to point towards the opponents (Miami Dolphins and Jacksonville Jaguars) things don’t get any tougher this week. The Browns have scored the fifth fewest points per game this season, at 15.8, and that’s just the start:
Interceptions – 9 (league high)
Sacks – 13 (among 10 most allowed)
Over the past two weeks the Jets have 3 INT and 4 sacks, both of which they should be able to expand upon with a rookie quarterback under center. Throw in a running game that’s struggled, averaging just 76.5 yards per game, and if you were going to utilize the Jets’ defense this would be the time to do so.
Oakland Raiders – vs. Baltimore
CBS Sports – 40%, ESPN – 5.3%
The Ravens’ offense is a disaster, averaging 15.0 points per game. While we thought Joe Flacco could get off to a slow start after missing much of the offseason due to injury, no one could’ve imagined that he’d be quite this bad. He’s thrown for just 601 yards over four games, with 4 TD vs. 6 INT (2 INT in each of the past two games).
This is a bit of a risk, as Oakland’s defense hasn’t been very good thus far. That said Baltimore’s offense is so bad that they could be considered a worthwhile gamble.

798,Breakingviews - Beijing’s closer embrace is bad news for Big Tech,"HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - President Xi Jinping’s closer embrace is bad news for Big Tech. China’s government wants stakes and board seats at web giants like Tencent, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday. Beijing is already influential behind the scenes in technology, and given its tightening grip elsewhere, a power grab in this vital sector was all but inevitable. This will nonetheless cost investors.
China’s bureaucrats have held discussions with Tencent, microblog-operator Weibo, and a video-streaming platform owned by e-commerce group Alibaba, according to the Journal, which cited people close to the companies. State-backed funds would buy a 1 percent stake via “special management shares” allowing them to put a government official on the board. The powerful internet watchdog has already trialled this arrangement with two startups, the newspaper said.
Xi’s government is increasing its control on everything from traditional media to private conglomerates like Dalian Wanda and Anbang. So, Beijing’s latest focus on social media and internet companies was to be expected.
To be sure, too, the government already exerts substantial sway over the sector. Tough censorship and capital controls mean bosses like Tencent’s Pony Ma need good relations with regulators. He and rivals like Jack Ma of Alibaba are also increasingly pushing into sensitive sectors like cloud computing and finance.
That said, government intervention in decision-making will have far more impact. Recently tech groups including Alibaba, Baidu, and JD.com injected $12 billion into state-owned telecom Unicom, as part of the government’s “mixed-ownership” reform. That could be the first of a series of politically motivated investments. So capital allocation could get worse.
Foreign scrutiny of Chinese takeovers is already increasing, and politicians in the United States, Europe and elsewhere are pushing for even tighter controls based on national security concerns. The $1 billion acquisition of U.S.-based MoneyGram by Ant Financial, Jack Ma’s financial-technology group, has been delayed, with the buyer having to refile an application, Reuters reported last month. Having direct state backing will make it much harder for these groups to argue they are independent actors.",fake

1877,World Cup 2018: Who needs what to qualify for Russia next year?,"Germany were crowned world champions for the fourth time at the 2014 tournament
England are nearly there but a World Cup place for the other home nations hangs in the balance before the final group qualifying matches.
Northern Ireland are guaranteed a top-two finish, while Wales and Scotland have the chance to finish second in their group, which may well seal a place in the play-offs for Russia 2018.
But coming second and staying in contention are not necessarily the same thing. More on that later.
Meanwhile, the Netherlands and Iceland face a battle to go through, while Argentina are in trouble and Syria are in a play-off to keep their unlikely World Cup dream alive.
Here, we analyse the scenarios to establish who needs what from the final two rounds of qualifiers. Bear with us - it's complicated, but worth it.
Who has already qualified?
The tournament will consist of 32 teams, with hosts Russia joined by 31 qualifiers from around the globe. The holders no longer qualify automatically, although Germany are on track to progress.
Eight sides are already guaranteed to be there: Russia, Brazil, Iran, Japan, Mexico, Belgium, Saudi Arabia and South Korea.
In Europe, the country that tops each of the nine groups reaches the finals, while the eight best second-placed sides go into play-offs.
What about the home nations?
Northern Ireland
Group C - Thursday: Germany (h) 19:45, Sunday: Norway (a) 19:45 (all times BST)
With just one defeat and only two goals conceded in eight matches, Northern Ireland - second in Group C - have more points than some group leaders.
Nine clear of third-placed Azerbaijan, they are guaranteed a top-two place as they look to reach their first World Cup since 1986.
Automatic qualification seems unlikely though - they need to beat Germany and Norway, and hope the Germans lose their final match against Azerbaijan. The reigning champions need just a draw in Belfast to top the group.
Wales
Group D - Friday: Georgia (a) 17:00, Monday: Republic of Ireland (h) 19:45
""Don't take me home, please don't take me home,"" sang the fans as Wales marched to the semi-finals of Euro 2016.
Now they want to cheer them in a second World Cup, with their only previous finals appearance coming in 1958. However, Chris Coleman's side must play their final two group matches without injured talisman Gareth Bale.
A win in Georgia on Friday will be enough to secure a top-two spot if the Republic of Ireland fail to beat Moldova at home. Otherwise, it could come down to Monday's meeting between Wales and Martin O'Neill's side in Cardiff.
Serbia lead the group and will qualify with a victory in Austria or at home to Georgia.
The Republic of Ireland can enter the play-off picture by defeating both Moldova and Wales. A win over Moldova and a draw with Wales would only be enough if the Welsh fail to beat Georgia.
England
Group F - Thursday: Slovenia 19:45 (h), Sunday: Lithuania (a) 17:00
Unbeaten England, with six wins and two draws, comfortably lead Group F and are poised to qualify automatically. They require one win, or two draws, or just a single point if second-placed Slovakia do not win both their matches.
Scotland
Group F - Thursday: Slovakia 19:45 (h), Sunday: Slovenia (a) 17:00
With just four points from their first four matches, few were rushing to back Scotland to reach Russia.
But victory over Slovenia, a draw with England and wins against Lithuania and Malta have put them back in the hunt for a first World Cup appearance since 1998.
Scotland could reach the play-offs by winning their final two matches, but defeat by Slovakia will end their hopes. Realistically, they need to beat Slovakia, because they will surely take maximum points in their final match at home to Malta.
The play-off puzzle
There's no easy way of explaining this, but here goes...
Eight of the nine European runners-up go into a two-legged play off for four places at next year's finals. That means the runner-up with the fewest points misses out. That unfortunate position is currently occupied by Wales, although plenty can change over the coming days.
Bosnia-Herzegovina, for example, are also on eight points and face two difficult games against already-qualified Belgium and an away game in Estonia.
It is important to note that results gained against the bottom-ranked sides in each group do not count in the final play-off standings.
This aspect also affects Scotland - who do not feature in the table below because they are currently fourth in their table - because having beaten Malta twice, like Wales they are effectively only on eight points.
The ranking of second-placed teams is decided simply by the highest number of points but then - if required - goal difference, followed by the highest number of goals scored, the highest number of goals scored away from home and then fair play points.
Fifa says teams will be seeded for the draw on 17 October, with the top four sides according to its ranking at the time in one pot and the remaining four in another.
The teams currently in second place are Portugal (3rd in Fifa rankings), Wales (13th), Italy (17th), Slovakia (19th), Northern Ireland (20th), Iceland (22nd), Sweden (23rd), Bosnia-Herzegovina (36th) and Montenegro (37th).
So while there are plenty of permutations, a Wales-Northern Ireland play-off is a possibility.
Play-off table Position/Team Played Goal difference Points 1 Portugal 6 18 15 2 N Ireland 6 7 13 3 Italy 6 3 13 4 Iceland 7 3 13 5 Slovakia 7 6 12 6 Sweden 6 3 10 7 Montenegro 6 3 10 8 Bosnia 6 2 8 9 Wales 6 1 8
Rest of Europe - could the Netherlands miss out?
Europe's places: 14 including hosts Russia. Already qualified: Belgium, Russia
They may be three-times World Cup runners-up but the Netherlands are in a scrap to reach next year's tournament.
The Dutch are in third place in Group A, behind France and Sweden, and will be out if they fail to at least match the Swedes' result on Saturday.
Sweden host Luxembourg before travelling to the Netherlands - who first visit Belarus - in a potential decider on Tuesday.
Surprise Euro 2016 quarter-finalists Iceland, who were the smallest nation to qualify for a major finals when they reached France two years ago, are in second place but level on points with Group I leaders Croatia.
Victories over Turkey and Kosovo would secure a play-off place at least, although the Turks and Ukraine are just two points behind.
Portugal, while sure of at least making the play-offs, face a critical final match at home to Switzerland on Tuesday as Cristiano Ronaldo and his team-mates try to overturn a three-point deficit in Group B.

Now this is some tale.
Syria remain in contention for the World Cup despite the odds being stacked against a nation that is in the middle of a six-year war.
The team has no funding because of sanctions and play their home games in Malaysia, which is a 9,000-mile round trip.
But they have made it through to a play-off against Australia and Omar Al Somah's late penalty allowed them to claim a 1-1 first-leg draw.
The return leg takes place in Sydney on Tuesday, 10 October (kick-off 10:00 BST).
The winner will face a Concacaf (North and Central America and the Caribbean) side in another two-legged tie the following month for a place at the World Cup.
South America - Argentina in trouble
Argentina have lost one and drawn two of their last three qualifying matches
South America places: 4 (plus a play-off place). Already qualified: Brazil
It seems almost inconceivable that Lionel Messi will not be at football's biggest tournament, but his Argentina side are in real danger of missing out.
The two-time champions, who have not missed the finals since 1970, are currently languishing in fifth place.
With the top four qualifying, that position would send them into a two-legged play-off against New Zealand, but even that scenario is far from assured with Copa America holders Chile lurking just a point behind in sixth.
Argentina take on Peru, who are above them in fourth on goal difference, before facing Ecuador.
South American World Cup qualifying: Fixtures - Tables
Concacaf - Who will join Mexico?
North America, Central America and Caribbean places: 3 (plus a play-off place). Already qualified: Mexico.
Mexico will compete at their seventh straight World Cup next summer, with Costa Rica also on the verge of direct qualification from the Concacaf section.
But a third automatic berth is still up for grabs, while the fourth-placed side can also qualify through the inter-continental play-offs.
Surprise package Panama, in third, lead the United States and Honduras by a single point.
North America, Central America and Caribbean World Cup qualifying: Fixtures - Tables
Africa - Nigeria on track
African places: 5 Already qualified: None
Nigeria are closing on a sixth World Cup appearance while Egypt - led by Liverpool's Mohamed Salah - are on course for their first finals since 1990, but Africa Cup of Nations champions Cameroon are out of the running.
There are no play-offs in Africa, with the team that tops each of the five qualifying groups going through. Tunisia, Ivory Coast and Burkina Faso are the other current group leaders.
African World Cup qualifying: Fixtures - Tables

837,The Ditch List: Week 4 Fallout: Breaking Down Four Players It May Be Time To Cut Bait On,"The Ditch List: Week 4 Fallout: Breaking Down Four Players It May Be Time To Cut Bait On
(Before It's News)
by Eric Stashin (aka The Rotoprofessor)
Not every cut is created equal, and it’s going to depend on your league size/format in many cases. That said there have been some obviously disappointing starts to the season and in the right circumstance three weeks is enough information to formulate a decision, cut bait and move on. Let’s take a look at a few candidates that you should consider dropping:
Amari Cooper – Oakland Raiders – Wide Receiver
Cooper had a difficult matchup against the Broncos, but his 2 reception, 8 yard performance is just the latest in what has been a disappointing season. Overall he’s turned 23 targets into 10 catches and 101 yards. Sure he’s scored a TD, but that came in Week 1 and he’s been virtually unusable over the past three weeks:
vs. New York Jets – 4 receptions for 33 yards
at Washington – 1 reception for 6 yards
at Denver – 2 receptions for 9 yards
With Derek Carr leaving yesterday’s game early only adds another little twist, as he could potentially be looking at E.J. Manuel starting in the short-term (though we’ll have to wait and see). Completely giving up on Cooper doesn’t make sense as there’s simply too much upside potential, but at this point he’s obviously a player who belongs on your bench and nowhere else.
Verdict – Firmly plant on your bench, but don’t give up
Paul Perkins – New York Giants – Running Back
He wasn’t doing much early in the game (9 carries for 13 yards), and then went down with an injury. In his place stepped Wayne Gallman, who looked better than Perkins has all season long as he turned 11 carries into 42 yards while catching 2 passes for 8 yards and 1 TD. We’ll have to wait and see how long Perkins is sidelined, but even if he doesn’t miss time you’d have to think that the Giants will give Gallman an opportunity (Perkins is averaging 2.1 yards per carry and has not rushed for more than 22 yards in a game). With his dismal production, his role in question and the potential injury, Perkins is a disposal player at this point.
Verdict – Droppable in 12-formats if you need roster spot
Eric Decker – Tennessee Titans – Wide Receiver
Marcus Mariota was injured, which would further hurt the upside of Decker (who has been a relative bust despite being one of the significant acquisitions for the team). Yesterday Decker was targeted just twice, putting up 2 receptions for 13 yards. He’s totaled 12 receptions for 104 yards and his season best is 4 receptions (Week 3) and 49 yards (Week 3). He’s been targeted a total of 20 times, though not more than 5 since Week 1 (he had 8 targets in the first week). He also has failed to find the end zone as Tennessee is a run based offense and Decker appears to be the third receiving option, at best:
Rishard Matthews – 32 targets
Delanie Walker – 26 targets
Eric Decker – 20 targets
At this point Decker is droppable in shallower formats, but worth stashing in deeper leagues if the waiver wire is fairly barren.
Verdict – Droppable in 12-team leagues (and shallower)
Breshad Perriman – Baltimore Ravens – Wide Receiver
This is the third season for the former first round draft pick, so expectations were high. Instead he’s been a bust with 25% of the season behind him, totaling 2 receptions for 11 yards. Just to make matters worse he has a total of 8 targets, which came split between Weeks 1 and 4 (he went untargeted in Weeks 2 and 3).
Perriman is going to be limited by the struggles of Joe Flacco, and he’s also going to be behind Jeremy Maclin and Mike Wallace on the depth chart. In other words the outlook is fairly limited, and there’s little reason to think that anything is going to change.
Verdict – Droppable in 14-team leagues (and shallower)

3986,Spain Catalan crisis: Puigdemont addresses region's future,"Image copyright AFP Image caption Carles Puigdemont has been urged to step back from declaring independence
Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont is announcing his plans for the future of the Spanish province.
He told the regional parliament in Barcelona that he wanted to ""de-escalate"" the tensions surrounding the issue.
There had been speculation that he would make a unilateral declaration of independence from Spain following a disputed referendum.
But there were also growing demands for him to drop plans to break away.
Reports say Catalan party leaders met before the session began an hour behind schedule.
LIVE coverage
A vote was held on 1 October which Catalan officials say resulted in almost 90% of voters backing independence for the north-eastern region. Turnout was put at 43%.
The vote was deemed illegal by Madrid and suspended by Spain's Constitutional Court. ""No"" voters largely boycotted the ballot and there were several reports of irregularities. National police were involved in violent scenes as they manhandled voters.
Mr Puigdemont hailed the referendum process and condemned the actions of the Spanish government, but acknowledged that people on all sides were worried about what would happen next.
""We are all part of the same community and we need to go forward together. The only way forward is democracy and peace,"" he told deputies.
But he also said Catalonia was being denied the right to self-determination, and paying too much in taxes to the central government in Madrid.
Catalan police have been posted outside the parliament in Barcelona, sealing off the grounds to the public. A large pro-independence rally is currently taking place in the area.
Analysis: Will Puigdemont make good his threat?
Tom Burridge, BBC News, Barcelona
Never before has the world watched Catalonia's regional parliament so closely. This evening, with probably large numbers of police and protesters outside, the leader of the devolved government is due to address Catalan MPs. Carles Puigdemont plans to present his government's results of the disputed referendum, which Madrid declared illegal.
Since then, Mr Puigdemont has said on several occasions that he will declare independence, despite fierce opposition across Spain and criticism from European governments.
Now, will he make good his threat? Or will he announce a more nuanced strategy, hoping still for a proper, recognised referendum one day? Under pressure to act, the Spanish government has made stark warnings, too. If the order comes, thousands of Spanish national police, here in Barcelona, could intervene.
What security measures are being taken?
The Catalan police force, the Mossos d'Esquadra, closed the Ciutadella Park, where parliament is located, early in the day, positioning vans near the entrances and alongside parliament.
The authorities said the measures were ""for safety reasons"".

The Catalan National Assembly (ANC), a non-party grassroots movement, earlier urged supporters in a tweet to come to the parliament district to ""defend"" the vote for independence.
What is Puigdemont likely to tell parliament?
Independence supporters have been sharing the Catalan hashtag #10ODeclaració (10 October Declaration) on Twitter.
Expectations are high that Mr Puigdemont will ask parliament to declare independence on the basis of the referendum law it passed last month.
Parliament, which is dominated by pro-independence parties, would then have 48 hours to vote.

Barcelona's influential mayor, Ada Colau, has urged Mr Puigdemont not to declare independence. She also called on Mr Rajoy to rule out direct control from Madrid.
The Madrid government called on the Catalan leader ""not to do anything irreversible, not to pursue a path of no return and not to make any unilateral independence declaration"".
European Council President Donald Tusk said: ""A few days ago I asked Prime Minister Rajoy to look for a solution to the problem without the use of force, to look for dialogue, because the use of dialogue is always better than the use of force.
""Today I ask you [Mr Puigdemont] to respect in your intentions the constitutional order and not to announce a decision that would make such a dialogue impossible.
""Diversity should not and need not lead to conflict whose consequences would obviously be bad for the Catalans, for Spain and for whole of Europe.""
When the BBC asked people for their opinion in Barcelona, one woman, Eva Iniesta, called for the Spanish government to open a ""dialogue so independence is not declared"".
But another person, Salvador Puig, said: ""We have demonstrated and said that we don't like being part of this home and we have the right to live in the home we want and in the way we want.""
How is Madrid likely to react?
Mr Rajoy is due to appear in Spain's parliament on Wednesday. He has already said any declaration of independence by Catalonia would ""lead to nothing"".
Image copyright Reuters Image caption Carles Puigdemont, left, and Mariano Rajoy show no signs of compromise
Under Article 155 of the constitution, his Spanish government could suspend devolution.
The leader of Spain's main opposition party, Pedro Sánchez of the Socialists, has said his party will back action by the government ""in the face of any attempt to break social harmony"".
What pressure is big business exerting?
A stream of companies have announced plans to move their head offices out of Catalonia in response to the crisis.
It is one of Spain's wealthiest regions, accounting for a quarter of the country's exports.
Publishing company Grupo Planeta is the latest to announce it will move from Barcelona to Madrid if there is a declaration of independence.
Do the separatists have support internationally?
The European Union has made clear that should Catalonia split from Spain, the region would cease to be part of the EU.
A European Commission spokesman told Reuters news agency it called on ""all those concerned to get of this confrontation as quickly as possible and to start dialogue"".
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption What do Scottish nationalists think about Catalonia?
The EU, he added, had confidence ""in the capacity of Prime Minister Rajoy to manage this delicate process in full respect of the Spanish constitution and the basic fundamental rights of the citizens"".
Austrian Finance Minister Hans Jörg Schelling warned the effects of Catalan independence could spread beyond Spain.
""I hope that this won't lead to a crisis in the euro and in the EU but the danger naturally exists because extreme positions are clashing,"" he said.
How did we reach this crisis?
Catalonia, a part of the Spanish state for centuries but with its own distinct language and culture, enjoys broad autonomy under the Spanish constitution.
However, a 2005 amendment redefining the region as a ""nation"", boosting the status of the Catalan language and increasing local control over taxes and the judiciary was reversed by the Constitutional Court in 2010.
The economic crisis further fuelled discontent and pro-independence parties took power in the region in the 2015 elections.
Attempts to hold a legal Scottish-style referendum on independence have got nowhere with the Spanish government.

3420,Factbox: Kobe Steel's data fabrication leaves 'Made-in-Japan' champions scrambling,"The Kobe Steel logo is seen in this illustration photo taken October 10, 2017. REUTERS/Thomas White/Illustration
TOKYO (Reuters) - The revelation that Japan’s third-biggest steelmaker Kobe Steel Ltd (5406.T) fabricated data for some of its aluminium and copper products has left affected manufacturers scrambling to pin down the potential impact.
The products were shipped to around 200 companies which include some of Japan’s most recognizable names:
AUTOMAKERS
Automakers affected by Kobe Steel’s announcement include Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T), Honda Motor Co (7267.T), Nissan Motor Co (7201.T), Mazda Motor Corp (7261.T) Subaru Corp (7270.T) and Mitsubishi Motors Corp (7211.T), the respective companies confirmed.
TOYOTA
Japan’s largest automaker Toyota said the compliance breach was a “grave issue”, adding that Kobe Steel’s products were used in vehicle doors and hoods.
NISSAN
Doors and hoods were also affected at Nissan, a spokesman said.
The automaker is grappling with its own compliance failures, recalling all new cars sold in Japan in the last three years after discovering final vehicle inspections were not performed by authorized technicians.
HONDA, SUBARU
Honda said doors and hoods were affected, while Subaru said vehicles and aircraft were affected.
Japanese industry ministry officials said Kobe Steel materials were used in some defense equipment made by Subaru.
MITSUBISHI HEAVY
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (7011.T) said Kobe Steel products were used on its Mitsubishi Regional Jet and rockets, including the H-2A rocket launched on Tuesday to put a navigation satellite into orbit. The rocket cleared all safety checks before launch, the company said.
Japanese industry ministry officials said Kobe Steel materials were used in some defense equipment made by Mitsubishi Heavy.
IHI
Heavy machinery maker IHI Corp (7013.T) said affected products were used in its jet engines.
IHI is a supplier for engines used on Boeing Co (BA.N) aircraft and in Japan’s defense and aerospace industries. The company did not say which engines used the affected products.
Japanese industry ministry officials said Kobe Steel materials were used in some defense equipment made by IHI.
KAWASAKI HEAVY
Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd (7012.T) said affected materials were used in airplane parts and airplane engine parts while it was still investigating to see if there were any other products including trains that used affected materials.
Japanese industry ministry officials said Kobe Steel materials were used in some defense equipment made by Kawasaki Heavy.
JR TOKAI
Central Japan Railway Company (JR Tokai) (9022.T), which operates the Shinkansen bullet train line between Tokyo and Osaka, said Kobe Steel’s products were used in some of its Shinkansen’s train trucks - the undercarriage of the train. The products were tested for safety before they were used, a spokesman said.",fake
1719,Italy's Enel eyes purchase of more Brazil assets after dam deal,"SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Italy’s Enel SpA is looking for opportunities to expand in Brazil’s power sector through acquisitions after winning a license last week to operate a large hydropower dam, the head of local operations told Reuters.
The Italian utility was weighing whether to bid for some regional distribution firms that are up for sale, said Carlo Zorzoli, Enel’s senior country officer in Brazil.
“Of course we are going to look at these concessions, because they are growth opportunities, and we are in a stage where we are weighing all opportunities to expand,” he said in an interview late on Friday.
State-controlled Centrais Elétricas Brasileiras SA, known as Eletrobras, wants to sell six of its power distribution companies later this year or early next year for what sources have said will be a token amount.
“We are active in the market, choosing the opportunities that best fit our strategy,” Zorzoli said.
Brazil’s power sector is going through a process of consolidation, with many local players putting assets up for sale to cut debt at a time of tight credit.
Enel spent 1.49 billion reais ($473 million) last week for a license to operate the Volta Grande hydroelectric dam, a 380-megawatt plant located in Minas Gerais state.
It was the second large acquisition in the sector in two years for Enel, which in recent years has focused on fast-growing Latin American investments to counterbalance sluggish European markets.
Last year, it won the privatization auction for Celg-D, a power distribution firm in Brazil’s center-west state of Goiás.
“Power distribution is one sector going through consolidation. The number of operators currently is too large,” said Zorzoli, adding that the Eletrobras auction looked to be attractive for investors.
Brazil’s government has tried to attract foreign capital to help boost the economy after the country’s worst recession on record.
Enel was also considering bidding for wind and solar power project licenses in Brazil this year, Zorzoli said, without elaborating.
A controlling stake in Rio de Janeiro power utility Light SA that is up for sale by Centrais Elétricas de Minas Gerais SA (Cemig) may also be of interest, he said.
“We are looking at all opportunities ... it depends on the conditions,” he said. “On the one hand it could offer synergies, on the other it could overload us with problems.”

2809,"No angst over Turkey's air defense deal with Russia, says NATO chief","CRAIOVA, Romania (Reuters) - NATO ally Turkey is not seeking to antagonize the U.S.-led alliance by purchasing Russian S-400 surface-to-air missiles and is in talks with France and Italy to buy similar weapons, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said.
Ankara’s decision to buy the Russian system has been seen in some Western capitals as a snub to the alliance, given tensions with Moscow over Ukraine and Syria, while the deal raised concern because the weapons cannot be integrated into NATO defense.
But Stoltenberg said it was a sovereign decision and that he had talked it through with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan.
“There hasn’t been any request from Turkey to integrate the S-400 into NATO air defense system,” Stoltenberg told Reuters in an interview on a Belgian military plane returning from Romania late on Monday.
“I spoke with President Erdogan when I met him in September. I said that the kind of capabilities different nations want to acquire is a national decision,” he said of the S-400 system that Turkey has made an advance payment for and hopes to see delivered in 2019.
Stoltenberg stressed that top Turkish officials, as well as Erdogan, had told him Ankara remained a strong NATO ally.
That was despite the S-400 issue and a dispute with Germany over Erdogan’s arrest of German nationals as part of a mass purge following last July’s failed coup bid.
Stoltenberg said Ankara was ready to brief its allies in the U.S.-led 29-member bloc on the reasons behind its decision to buy the S-400 system.
Erdogan has blamed NATO countries for failing to propose a viable alternative to the long-range Russian missiles, but Stoltenberg said Erdogan was now talking to Paris and Rome for similar systems, a move the alliance chief welcomed.
“He told me that Turkey is in dialogue with France and Italy on possible delivery of air defense systems from them ... on top of the S-400,” Stoltenberg said.
Stoltenberg did not give more details but said Turkey was familiar with the so-called SAMP-T missiles developed because Italy had stationed them in Turkey as part of NATO efforts to help protect Ankara from rocket attacks.
Such weapons are designed to protect battlefields and strategic sites such as airports and sea ports against airborne threats, including cruise missiles and aircraft.
The SAMP-T system is produced by Italian-French consortium Eurosam, a joint venture between European missile maker MBDA and Thales.
Russia uses different technology, as well as know-how that Moscow is unlikely to be willing to share, experts say.
“For NATO, the important thing is interoperability,” Stoltenberg said, speaking on his return from the launch of a NATO force aimed at deterring Russia in the Black Sea region.
“We encourage, facilitate allies to develop systems, acquire and operate systems together that will reduce costs and strengthen the defense industries within the alliance,” he said.
ZAPAD MISTRUST
As part of NATO’s collective defense pledge, the allies integrate their ships, planes and weapons systems to make them work together, as well as sharing command across the alliance.
Some eastern European allies that were once under Soviet rule still rely on Russian-made planes, but integrating Russia’s most advanced ground-based missile system would also be highly complicated for political reasons.
While Stoltenberg, a former Norwegian prime minister, took up the NATO post three years ago with a more conciliatory tone toward Moscow than his Danish predecessor Anders Fogh Rasmussen, Russia’s Crimea annexation in March 2014 had already badly damaged East-West ties.
In the latest dispute, Stoltenberg said Moscow had given misleading information about the size of its war games, known as Zapad, or West, last month.
“Our assessment so far shows that the scale and geographic scope of the Zapad exercise significantly exceeded what was announced,” he said, although he said so far there were no signs Russia had left behind troops or weapons in Belarus during the exercises, as some Baltic nations had feared.
Russia said Zapad involved some 13,000 troops and has accused NATO allies of exaggerating the size of the drills.",fake
3413,NATO launches Black Sea force as latest counter to Russia,"CRAIOVA, Romania (Reuters) - NATO launched a new multinational force in Romania on Monday to counter Russia along its eastern flank and to check a growing Russian presence in the Black Sea following the Kremlin’s 2014 seizure of Crimea.
The force will initially be built around a Romanian brigade of up to 4,000 soldiers, supported by troops from nine other NATO countries, and complementing a separate deployment of 900 U.S. troops who are already in place. The plans are to include additional air and sea assets to give the force greater capabilities.
“Our purpose is peace, not war,” Romanian President Klaus Iohannis told the NATO Parliamentary Assembly of alliance lawmakers, which is meeting this year in Bucharest.
“We are not a threat for Russia. But we need dialogue from a strong position of defense and discouragement,” he said, before flying to the Craiova military base in south-eastern Romania.
At the base, as military bands played, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg stood alongside Iohannis, addressed some of the troops in green face paint and inspected vehicles and weapons.
“We are sending a very clear message: NATO is here, NATO is strong and NATO is united,” Stoltenberg told assembled Polish, Romanian, Spanish and Portuguese soldiers.
Russia accuses NATO of trying to encircle it and threatening stability in Eastern Europe, which NATO denies. Around the Black Sea, Romania, Bulgaria and Turkey are NATO members while Georgia and Ukraine aspire to join.
The NATO force aims to develop its presence in the Black Sea region, rich in oil and gas, without escalating tensions as it seeks to counter Russia’s own plans to create what military analysts say is a “buffer zone”.
The 2008 Russian operation to put troops in Georgia’s South Ossetia region, its support for separatists in eastern Ukraine since 2014 and its annexation of Crimea have raised the stakes, with all sides warning of a new, Cold-War style scenario.
Apart from Romania, Poland is the biggest troop contributor. Bulgaria, Italy and Portugal will train regularly with the force in Craiova, and Germany is also expected to contribute.
In additional to existing NATO Black Sea naval patrols, a maritime presence will include more allied visits to Romanian and Bulgarian ports, training and exercises.

‘WEST BERLIN’ MODEL
Some Eastern Europeans want NATO’s new ballistic missile defense shield, which includes a site in Romania, to be part of NATO’s eastern posture vis-a-vis Russia.
Slideshow (5 Images)
“The Aegis Ashore system would add another level of deterrence,” said Maciej Kowalski, an analyst at the Polish Casimir Pulaski Foundation, referring to the U.S.-built system.
NATO says the system is to intercept any Iranian rockets.
As in the Baltics and Poland, where the U.S.-led alliance has some 4,000 troops, NATO says the relatively light multinational model recalls allied support for West Berlin in the 1950s, when the presence of British, French and U.S. forces ensured the Soviet Union could not control all of Berlin.
Under NATO’s founding treaty, an attack on one ally is an attack on all, meaning all 28 NATO nations would be required to respond in the case of any potential Russian aggression.
While months in planning, the establishment of the force comes as Russia winds down its biggest war games since 2013. The Zapad, or West, games showed off Moscow’s latest weaponry and its ability to quickly mass forces on NATO’s borders.
The enhanced NATO presence in Romania and Bulgaria marks a diplomatic success for Bucharest, which gained greater persuasive power because it is set to reach a NATO goal of spending 2 percent of economic output on defense this year, a priority for U.S. President Donald Trump.
Romania pushed for bigger NATO naval presence on the Black Sea for more than a year, but found its neighbor Bulgaria wary of provoking Russia.
Turkey supports only limited NATO reinforcements, concerned about breaking international rules limiting the scale of patrols in the Black Sea. Turkey has played down the extent of Russia’s militarization of Crimea, which NATO says involves deploying surface-to-air missiles and communications jamming equipment.",fake

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan on Tuesday launched a fourth satellite for a new high-precision global positioning system (GPS) it hopes will encourage new businesses and help spur economic growth.
The fourth Michibiki satellite lifted off from Japan’s southern Tanegashima space port aboard an H-2A rocket taking just over 28 minutes to reach orbit, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency said.
Having four satellites that loop over Japan and Australia in a figure of eight orbit will allow for uninterrupted coverage and puts engineers on course to switch the system on in April.
Japanese GPS can locate devices to within several centimeters compared with the commonly-used U.S. system, which has an accuracy of about 10 meters.

WELLINGTON/GENEVA (Reuters) - Britain and the European Commission formally told other members of the World Trade Organization on Wednesday how they plan to split up the European Union’s WTO-agreed tariff quotas and farm subsidies after Brexit.
On paper, the task of establishing the terms for Britain’s independent membership of the WTO is one of the simplest parts of the Brexit divorce. But navigating the minefield of agricultural trade is tricky in practice.
“Our agreed collaborative approach shows real progress on how the UK government intends to take forward our future trading arrangements with the world,” British International Trade Secretary Liam Fox said in a statement.
The intention to “apportion” the EU’s existing agricultural quota commitments based on trade flows had already been leaked to other WTO members, seven of whom fired a pre-emptive warning shot in their own letter last week.
Without unanimous approval of Britain’s new membership terms at the 164-member WTO, any country could launch a lengthy trade dispute if they feel their trading interests have been damaged.
Agricultural exporters to the EU argue that Britain should duplicate the low-tariff quotas offered by the EU so Brexit does not undermine the trade flexibility they currently enjoy.
But a source familiar with trade negotiations in New Zealand saw very tough discussions ahead.
“All that the EU and the UK have done now is open themselves up to a world of pain. But really this is going to be very serious for them,” said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
New Zealand wants to preserve its lamb exports to Britain while keeping its right to divert those shipments to elsewhere in the EU.
The source said Wellington had been telling London and Brussels that the issue was complicated ever since Britain’s June 2016 referendum.
“So they’ve done exactly what we said would be a problem. And what I thought was very remarkable was the way in which both the EU and the UK presented it as some sort of triumphant breakthrough in their process. Now, good news for them that they can work together on something, that’s great. But as a breakthrough, forget it.”
As well as facing resistance from existing suppliers to the EU such as the United States, Brazil and Australia, the “apportionment” plan could open Britain and the EU up to demands from more recent WTO joiners such as Russia and China, who will also want a slice of the market, the New Zealand source said.",fake

In “The Rap Year Book,” you ranked the most important rap songs for each year from 1979 to 2014. In rap, there are albums that you might love because they are technically good, and there are others you love because they’re connected to specific memories. Does that work the same way for you with basketball players?
Absolutely. There’s a chapter in the book called “Who Is Your Memory Hero?” It’s about that exact thing. Like, who is a player that you remember when you were a kid and were like, “This is the best basketball player in the world,” and when you got older you realized that person was actually not that good? For me, it was this guy who played on the Spurs named Vinny Del Negro. For some reason he was just a lovable guy. Part of it was there was a rumor going around that he was actually Mexican, so me and my friends were like, “He is the M.V.P. of the league because of that.” I got older and looked him up, he bounced in and out of the league, he was never an All-Star, wasn’t that great, but I’ll love him forever. In that chapter, I had some other basketball writers write about people they thought about in that same sort of way. That’s probably one of my favorite chapters, too.
If you were to betray the Spurs and take on a new favorite team, what team would it be?
This year it would be the Oklahoma City Thunder. It changes based on the year. This year they have Russell Westbrook, he’s a very intense point guard for them. They became one of my favorite teams last year because Kevin Durant, who was his main partner, left for a better team. I’m drawn to the teams that I know aren’t going to win a championship but are still going to fight for it. And that’s very much what the Thunder are right now.

If you could build your perfect player using the skill and athletic ability of various players, which players would you choose?
Give me Jason Kidd’s vision; Steph Curry’s shooting ability; 1994 Hakeem Olajuwon to protect the rim; Larry Bird’s chin (he’s gotten punched in the face several times and never gone down); 2010 Dwight Howard’s shoulders, which are beautiful; Russell Westbrook’s pettiness; Dirk Nowitzki’s one-footed fadeaway (it’s impossible to block); Tim Duncan’s end-game demeanor (he just never gets flustered); Gary Payton’s trash talking ability; and Reggie Miller’s late-game heroics.
Do you have any basketball memorabilia with sentimental value? What’s the story behind it?
I have a basketball signed by David Robinson, who was one of the greatest Spurs of all time. He came to Sam Houston State when I was there. I had never met him before, and I got a phone call one day from a buddy of mine, and he was telling me, “David Robinson is here and he’s giving a talk.” I went to go try to get in, but it was already full. I saw the high school basketball team hanging around, so I assumed their coach had set up a meet and greet with David, so I just hung out with them. The coach noticed me and told me I had to leave, so I was bummed out. As I’m walking down the hall, David Robinson came out of one of the rooms. In my head I thought I was going to have all this charming stuff to say to him and we were going to become friends. I panicked. I didn’t say any words at all. I just handed him the ball and the marker and mumbled my name. He wrote a Bible passage on it; he’s very religious. He gave it to me, and I just walked off.",fake

MOMBASA, Kenya (Reuters) - Two staff members of a Kenyan university were killed south of Mombasa on Tuesday when gunmen fired on vehicles carrying them and students to their campus, the area police chief said.
The identity of the gunmen was unclear. Police in the coastal county of Kwale, where the Technical University of Mombasa (TUM) has a campus, said they could be robbers or militants.
Security is poor in the area and the convoy had a police escort. Somali Islamist militants al Shabaab frequently carry out attacks along the Kenyan coast and have been recruiting new members there.
In 2015, al Shabaab gunmen killed 148 students at a university in Kenya’s Garissa town near the Kenya-Somali border, an attack that provoked shock and outrage in Kenya and abroad.
Two staff members of the university were killed Tuesday’s attack, and a driver and two policemen were wounded, area police chief Joseph Chebusit told Reuters.

“A bus carrying students of TUM was ferrying them from their hostels to the campus in Ukunda for classes and was being escorted by a van that had some staff of the college and two escort police officers,” the policeman said.
“Armed men numbering about 10 emerged from the bushes and started firing at the van in front. As a result two ladies who are staff of TUM were killed in the van. The driver of the van and two police officers were injured,” he said.

“We have information that the attackers had other accomplices along the road who were monitoring the movement of the two vehicles and communicating with them to enable the attack,” he added.
“For now we are treating it as a crime like any other as we continue with investigations but that does not mean we are ruling out al Shabaab.”
A witness who did not want to be named told Reuters she and several other students had fled their vehicle when gunmen opened fire on them and had seen several students covered in blood.

2517,The New Goosebumps Movie Trailer Is Out And It Has All The Monsters You Could Want!,"The New Goosebumps Movie Trailer Is Out And It Has All The Monsters You Could Want!
 
 
If you grew up in the 90’s you are probably more than familiar with the franchise Goosebumps. Well now there is an upcoming movie based on these nostalgic books that brings all the old monsters to life.
 
The trailer for the film was released on Wednesday and seems to almost have a Jumanji type vibe. Jack Black plays a fictional version of the writer of the series, R.L. Stine. Stine gets a new neighbor next door that hopes to win the heart of Stine’s daughter. In doing so, he accidentally releases all of the horrifying monsters locked inside Stine’s original manuscripts.
 
From there it seems to seem like Jumanji like I was saying earlier. They all must capture the monsters that have escaped by forcing them back into the book.
 
Being that I loved these books as a kid, I’ll defiantly give it a chance, but who’s to say it’ll be good. It might just be another lame attempt at remaking something that was already amazing. The references to monsters so far though include:
 
The Abominable Snowman of Pasadena
 
My Best Friend is Invisible
 
The Giant Praying Mantis from A Shocker on Shock Street
 
The Werewolf of Fever Swamp
 
Why I’m Afraid of Bees
 
The plant from Stay Out of the Basement
 
Revenge of the Lawn Gnomes
 
and my favorite Slappy from Night of the Living Dummy
 
 
I’m crossing my fingers that it’ll be good. Check out the trailer below and share it with your friends!

3289,Security guard who found Vegas gunman was alone and unarmed: 'I was just doing my job',"An unarmed security guard at Las Vegas' Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino was the first to take on gunman Stephen Paddock, getting shot in the process, but providing crucial help for police looking to stop the massacre.
The security guard, identified as Jesus Campos by the International Union, Security, Police and Fire Professionals of America, was shot in the leg after Paddock fired at him through a door, police said.
Police said Paddock managed to fire off over 200 rounds as the security guard approached the suspect's room alone. But the guard managed to direct police to the exact location of Paddock's suite and even provided a hotel key to officers looking to clear rooms on the 32nd floor before they insisted he get medical attention.
Reached by phone Wednesday night, Campos told ABC News, ""I'm fine.""
The guard who found the shooter and helped bring the massacre to an end said, ""I was just doing my job.""
Campos provided information over the phone that helped authorities locate the 32nd-floor room that Paddock was firing from, a spokesperson for the union said.
Drew Angerer/Getty Images
Campos was on ""random patrol"" as a security officer at the hotel when he found the shooter, said Liliana Rodriguez, who identified herself as a coworker of Campos' at Mandalay Bay on a GoFundMe page she set up for him.
""Any one of us could have been in the position he was in,"" Rodriguez wrote. ""Most importantly we are a home away from home and at the end of the day we are a team and we should all go home together.""
Campos was unarmed when he engaged with Paddock, the union spokesperson confirmed, which was first reported by The Daily Beast.
Speaking this evening, Clark County Sheriff Joseph Lombardo praised Campos, saying he aided officers in their search for Paddock.
Lombardo added that Paddock fired ""well over 200 rounds"" into the hallway when the security guard approached. Paddock had set up a camera in the hallway, apparently to watch for approaching authorities.
""It's amazing"" that Campos didn't sustain more injuries, Lombardo said.
""His bravery was amazing,"" Lombardo added. ""He gave our officers the key card for the room and then continued clearing rooms until he was ordered to go seek attention.""
On Sunday, about 22,000 concertgoers were attending the final night of the Route 91 Harvest Festival on the Las Vegas Strip -- across the street from the Mandalay Bay hotel -- when Paddock began his deadly assault.
It took authorities just minutes to locate where the bullets were coming from after the attack rang out. Once police breached the door to Paddock's suite on the 32nd floor of the hotel, they found him dead of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound.
A total of 58 people were killed and 489 injured in the attack. A motive is still not known, but police said the shooting was ""obviously premeditated.""

1033,Disney’s Big Bet on Streaming Relies on Little-Known Tech Company,"In August, Disney announced that it would introduce two subscription streaming services, both built by BamTech. One, focused on sports programming and made available through the ESPN app, would arrive in the spring. The other, centered on movies and television shows from Disney, Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm, would debut in late 2019.
“We’re going to launch big, and we’re going to launch hot,” Mr. Iger promised at a subsequent investor conference.
Disney had experimented with building a streaming platform on its own, to mixed results. It also toyed with the idea of buying Twitter.
Photo
But Mr. Iger was impressed with BamTech. Based in Manhattan’s Chelsea Market, a former factory for the National Biscuit Company, the 850-employee company has a strong track record — no serious glitches, even when delivering tens of millions of live streams at a time. BamTech also has impressive advertising technology (inserting ads in video based on viewer location) and a strong reputation for attracting and keeping viewers, not to mention billing them.
“BamTech really is as good as it gets,” said Mike Vorhaus, president of Magid Advisors, a media and technology consultant.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
BamTech grew out of Major League Baseball Advanced Media, or Bam for short, which was founded in 2000 as a way to help teams create websites. By 2002, Bam was experimenting with streaming video as a way for out-of-town fans to watch games.
Soon, Bam developed technology that attracted outside clients, including the WWE, Fox Sports, PlayStation Vue and Hulu. HBO went to Bam in 2014 after failing to create a reliable stand-alone streaming service on its own. Could Bam get HBO up and running — in just a few months?
Bam built HBO Now for roughly $50 million, delivering it just in time for the Season 5 premiere of “Game of Thrones,” which went off flawlessly. “They were nothing short of herculean for us,” said Richard Plepler, HBO’s chief executive.
In 2015, Bam decided to spin off its streaming division, calling it BamTech. With an eye toward its own direct-to-consumer future, particularly with ESPN, Disney paid $1 billion in 2016 for a 33 percent stake and an option to buy a controlling interest in 2020. To run the stand-alone company, M.L.B. and Disney recruited Michael Paull, 46, from Amazon, where he oversaw Prime Video and the introduction of Amazon Channels.
Disney started talking about the inevitable shift toward streaming in 2006, according to Kevin Mayer, Disney’s chief strategy officer. But the world’s largest entertainment company had to be careful: It could not embrace a new business model at the expense of its still highly profitable existing one — at least not until it saw a tipping point.
So Disney, along with other television companies, first tried something called TV Everywhere. Introduced in 2010, it allowed people to watch television shows on mobile devices as long as they “authenticated” themselves as current cable or satellite subscribers. But that cable bundle-saving effort proved cumbersome and never completely caught on.
About three years ago, Disney started to look at streaming more aggressively. Disney experimented with going it alone, quietly developing an app called DisneyLife. Introduced in November 2015 in Britain, DisneyLife offered old Disney movies and television series, children’s e-books, games and music. Subscriptions cost about $13 a month.
The lesson from that was without new movies, or at least exclusive content, interest was limited. Disney soon cut the subscription price in half. After two years, analysts estimate that DisneyLife has only about 437,000 subscribers. (It was never introduced outside Britain.)
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Disney also weighed a bid for Twitter. “We thought Twitter had global reach, a pretty interesting user interface and a compelling way that we might be able to present and sell the content that our company makes to the consumer,” Mr. Iger said at a Vanity Fair conference last Tuesday. Ultimately, though, Disney passed. Twitter’s growing reputation as a platform where hate speech can be disseminated would have posed a problem for the Disney brand.
So when Mr. Iger decided in June that the time had come to reposition Disney’s television division for growth by offering its sports, movies and television programming directly to consumers, he asked BamTech to accelerate Disney’s option to take a controlling interest. By early August, Disney had agreed to spend an additional $1.58 billion to bring its BamTech stake to 75 percent.

Most analysts cheered Disney’s streaming plans, but some investors seem to be taking a wait-and-see approach. One reason is cost.
Start-up expenses are unknown, but Disney has signaled that they will be huge. (Analysts estimate that marketing alone could easily run $150 million annually.) Disney has also not announced how much it will charge for subscriptions to the still-unnamed services. (Analysts are guessing $5 to $9 a month.) What is certain: To stock its own offerings, Disney plans to pull content from other services — Disney, Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm movies will eventually disappear from Netflix — eliminating an enormous, reliable revenue stream.
Michael Nathanson, a media analyst, estimates that Netflix, for instance, pays Disney $325 million annually to license those films. Also moving to one of the services will be reruns of Disney Channel shows, which generate roughly $500 million annually in third-party licensing fees, according to Doug Mitchelson, an analyst at UBS.
Photo
At the same time, Disney has pledged to make original movies and series for its nonsports service, easily adding $150 million in costs.
There has also been some sniping about how much Disney paid for BamTech. Speaking at a Goldman Sachs conference last month, Leslie Moonves, chief executive of CBS, boasted that his company’s All Access and Showtime streaming services had been built internally.
“We didn’t go buy BamTech for a zillion dollars,” he said.
Disney contends that a big part of BamTech’s value has been overlooked. Down the road, as other media companies move toward streaming, BamTech intends to sign them up as clients.
“That’s going to be a massive business, and BamTech is going to be a massive winner in it,” Mr. Mayer, Disney’s chief strategist, said in an interview.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Still, by the end of next year, BamTech will lose one important customer: HBO, which is moving to a global platform built by its own tech team. “They understood from the very beginning that eventually we would grow our way to independence,” Mr. Plepler said.
For some, Disney’s track record with digital acquisitions is the biggest concern.
Whenever the company has wandered away from content-related mega-purchases (Pixar, Marvel), results have been disappointing. Misfires include the social media-focused game maker Playdom, purchased for $563 million in 2010, and the online video network Maker, bought for $500 million in 2014.
Disney.com has also given the company headaches, with managers trying a series of redesigns and strategic retrenchments.
This time may well be different, in part because failing isn’t an option. And, in a contrast to those smaller acquisitions, Mr. Iger has pledged to devote much of his time over the next 21 months — he insists he will retire in July 2019 — to the twin streaming initiatives. BamTech’s remaining minority owners, M.L.B. and the National Hockey League, also have an interest in the effort succeeding.
Mr. Paull, a Harvard M.B.A. with experience at Sony Music, will report to Mr. Mayer, who joined Disney in 1993 before leaving in 2000 to run Playboy.com. He soon returned to Disney to work on Go.com, a web portal that eventually failed, and other Disney websites, including ESPN.com, before moving to strategic planning.
Though BamTech has proved its streaming bona fides, it still lacks the algorithms and the personalization skills that have helped propel Netflix to success. To fill that gap, Mr. Paull recently hired the former chief technology officer of the F.B.I. to be the head of analytics.
BamTech’s headquarters are a massive sprawl. Inside the darkened “transmission operations center” on a recent afternoon, walls of monitors displayed hundreds of live events — baseball, golf, hockey, boxing, a speech by President Trump — being streamed to somewhere at that moment.
Outside the operations room, in a series of alcoves, including one that used to house an oven where Oreos were baked, employees monitor games and are the first line of defense if something goes wrong with a stream. They’re nicknamed the Night’s Watch, from HBO’s “Game of Thrones.”

The level of engineering required for that enormous volume of content is no small matter. Each bit of streamable content has to be made to fit a dizzying number of requirements. Start with web browsers, ranging from Safari to Chrome or Explorer, all of which have slightly different demands. It also has to fit every iPhone and Android phone. And then there are connected living room devices like Apple TV.
“The complexity there is incredible,” Mr. Paull said during a tour. “It’s thousands and thousands of different applications we need to build to support that entire ecosystem. Then you add in international and the complexities of languages, currencies, payment mechanisms.”
He added, “That’s one of the big, big barriers to entry if you want to have a scaled digital video service.”",fake

A Memphis area police officer is under arrest after Secret Service officers first found him urinating in public, then discovered nine guns and three knives in his car.
Officers approached Timothy Bates near the corner of 17th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue who then told them that he was headed for meetings with NSA Director Mike Rogers and Defense Secretary James Mattis to discuss “missing paychecks and how to get the chip out of my head” according to an official report.
Once the suspect was taken in for mental observation, authorities searched his 2009 Nissan and discovered handguns, AR- and AK-style rifles, suppressors, ammunition, knives and brass knuckles.
Court records show Bates is scheduled to make his first appearance in D.C. Superior Court Monday afternoon.

1841,Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah end split on Gaza,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption A Palestinian celebrates following the announcement by Hamas that it had reached a deal with Fatah
Hamas and Fatah have signed a landmark reconciliation deal in Cairo in a key step towards ending a decade-long rift between the two Palestinian factions.
The deal will see administrative control of the Gaza Strip handed to a Fatah-backed unity government.
Egypt has been brokering the reconciliation talks in Cairo.
Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank have been ruled separately since deadly clashes between the two groups broke out in 2007.
Hamas won parliamentary elections in the occupied territories the previous year, and reinforced its power in Gaza after ousting Fatah from the enclave.
On Thursday, negotiators said the new deal included the handing over of control of the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt to the Fatah-backed government, which will be handed administrative responsibilities by December.
The Palestinian Accord Government said it will also station forces in the Gaza Strip by December ""at the latest"".
A Hamas spokesman, Salah al-Bardawil, said it was ""a new chapter in Palestinian history"".
Image copyright Reuters Image caption Palestinian PM Rami Hamdallah (right) holds hands with Hamas's leader in Gaza, Ismail Haniyeh
Fatah's lead negotiator, Azzam al-Ahmad, said the plan was to ""carry on implementing all the clauses of the agreement, especially those related to solving the crisis of the [Gaza] employees"".
Tens of thousands of civil servants employed by the Palestinian Authority have been out of work since Hamas took control of the Gaza Strip in 2006.
Both sides called the agreement a major breakthrough.
In response to Thursday's announcement, an Israeli government official said that any unity deal ""must include a commitment to international agreements"", adding that Hamas must disarm and recognise Israel.
'Final agreement'
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said on Thursday that the talks had led to a ""final agreement"" to end the rival split.
""I welcome the agreement,"" he told the AFP news agency, adding: ""I received a detailed report from the Fatah delegation about what was agreed and I considered it the final agreement to end the division.""
Mr Abbas is reportedly planning to travel to the Gaza Strip in the coming weeks in what would be his first visit to the territory in a decade.
Full details of the agreement are due to be announced later on Thursday.
What caused the rift?
Fatah, once the cornerstone of the Palestinian national cause, lost power in 2006 when Hamas won a stunning victory in the Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC) elections.
Tensions between the two rivals caused numerous violent clashes in the Gaza Strip.
In early 2007, Fatah and Hamas agreed to form a coalition to end the growing factional violence.
But in June of that year, Hamas seized Gaza by force after Mahmoud Abbas ordered the dissolution of the Hamas-led government and set up a rival government, leaving Fatah and the PA running parts of the West Bank not under Israeli control.
Mr Abbas later ruled out reconciliation with Hamas unless it gave up the Gaza Strip and submitted to his authority.
In April 2014, Hamas agreed a reconciliation deal with Fatah that led to the formation of a national unity government, but this has never been fully implemented.
Who controls what?
Hamas has largely controlled Gaza since it took power in 2006, while Fatah governs the Palestinian territory of the West Bank.
As a result of the militant group's rule in the Gaza Strip, the territory has become the subject of Israeli and Egyptian restrictions with much of the population dependent on food aid.
Since 2006, the two countries have maintained a land and sea blockade on Gaza in an attempt to prevent attacks by Gaza-based militants. The measures have also aggravated electricity and fuel shortages.
The announcement of a deal, which includes the control of Gaza's borders, has raised hopes among the territory's two million residents that humanitarian conditions in will improve.
Earlier this month, Hamas allowed the Ramallah-based Palestinian government to take over public institutions in Gaza as part of a reconciliation process between the two rival administrations.
The move had been a key demand of Mr Abbas.
Palestinian Prime Minister Rami Hamdallah then made a rare trip to Gaza. He said the Palestinian Authority would begin taking control of Gaza's administrative affairs and ""security responsibilities"".
However, the fate of Hamas' security forces and 25,000-strong military wing, has been one of the thorniest issues preventing reconciliation and remains to be resolved.
Cairo talks 'serious and deep'
Image copyright EPA Image caption Fatah's Azam al-Ahmed (right) and Hamas deputy head of the politburo Saleh al-Aruri sign the agreement
The agreement on Thursday was announced by the pro-Hamas Palestinian Information Centre.
On Wednesday, Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri said the talks in Cairo had been ""serious and deep"".
""The talks are positive and the Egyptian side is even-handed,"" he said, according to the Palestinian Information Centre.
Hamas, which calls for Israel's destruction, has fought three wars with the Jewish state.
Israel resolutely opposes any involvement by Hamas in the Palestinian Authority. It considers Hamas a terrorist group and has said it will not deal with a Palestinian government that contains Hamas members.
Hamas as a whole, or in some cases its military wing, is designated a terrorist group by Israel, the US, EU, UK and other powers.",fake

(Before It's News)
Listen up, the gamers among you! Yes, you’ve heard correctly. You’re definitely not dreaming, as today more than ever, you can make real money while enjoying your favorite pastime – playing video games. This is certainly the dream job! In recent years, video game playing has become more akin to sports betting, as a huge, still not well-known gambling market has opened its doors to gamers across the world. Don’t worry, you don’t need to be a hacker to crack into this social gaming experience. The tendency of online betting sites to diversify and attract those who have never set foot in casinos into gambling has led to this lovely convergence of technology and skill that allows you to challenge others on real money bets. Without being considered gambling, videogame betting offers an incomparable betting experience, as it allows you to bet on your own skills, rather than on luck. Everything is indeed in your hands! It is a perfect opportunity for the pro to make some real cash while building up your skills and maybe use them on other betting sites. Still wondering where to find the best paying video games or how to choose the right betting sites? Here’s how. Legal vs. Illegal Video Game Betting Social gaming for real money is a very controversial issue, as to whether it is really to be considered a form of gambling. This is why you should first start by digging some reliable information about the legality of video game betting where you’re based. American state laws on betting differ from one another in many aspects. In different states, there exist restrictions on different games and in some, on the whole real-money gaming experience. As of 2016, 12 US states don’t allow betting on video games, but practice tournaments and challenges are allowed. These states are Arizona, Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Louisiana, Maryland, Montana, South Carolina, South Dakota and Tennessee. In Quebec, Canada it is also deemed illegal to play video games for real money. Other most common restrictions apply to the age of the players. Earlier this year, the UK Gambling Commission has also condemned many unlicensed websites offering social gaming for real money as illegal. So, do your research first. Find the Best Real Money Videogame Sites Having done a bit of research on the legality of the game-play betting sites, it’s time to dive in straight-head into the sea of online betting options out there. Start by reading trustworthy reviews and consider browsing first the best well-known sites. These betting sites generally offer an enormous entourage of sports wagering options, the most popular being football, basketball and soccer. However, unless you’re playing FIFA, you might not be able to find many other skill-based tournaments. You can be sure that the latest slot sites on the market by slotswebsites.org offer the same quality as the top online casinos. This might seem counterintuitive for many of you, as slots in real life are seen as a passive, luck-based gambling option. This is not the case when wagering online. Online casino sites are now all about innovation to answer the whims of the most pretentious, easily bored gamblers. Slots sites are also a good starting point exactly because they’re not so well-known for their console betting options. To recap, the best betting sites for gamers are those that are trustworthy; have various payment options and offer great bonuses and perks, such as premium memberships, leader boards and mobile integration. Which Type of Video Game Betting to Choose? Videogame wagering is certainly here to stay, as it offers a fun, novel way to make real money from the comfort of your home. Passionate gamers are especially advantaged, as they don’t have to learn the rules of the games from scratch, contrary to traditional casino or sport betting where it’s vital to understand how odds are calculated. The gamers familiar with games such as Counter-Strike, Dota, League of Legends, Call of Duty and FIFA will be relieved to know that these are also the highest-ranking games when it comes to video-game wagering. SlotsWebsites.org also lists other lesser popular console games that can bring you a real profit. Even if you’re an extraordinary player, check out some of these guides before setting off to the betting sites. If you’re serious about making money out of gaming, consider also the following videogame betting options. The eSports League for Pro Gamers E-sport competitive gaming is the most widespread type of gaming for real money and it certainly has the potential to turn gaming into a professional sport of the same merit as football and basketball. In many respects, e-sports are similar to real life sports, with teams, leagues, commentators and coaches living and breathing the games. E-Sports is really for the cream of the crop players, but one can enter by watching the contests and betting, just like in regular sport wagering. Tournaments & Challenge Sites Videogame tournaments offering substantial cash prizes are probably the second most popular hook for gamers, but they’re generally seen as harder for the rookies to score a win, since you’d be competing against gamers of all levels, including the professionals. However, playing is not compulsory, you can easily bet on two-player or multiplayer games for as little as a $1. Once you’ve put up a brave face and decided to give it a go, you can register for free and be matched with another player or challenge your friends and agree on a bet. The results are automatically monitored by the site’s operator, providing a fairer game experience and you can cash out, as soon as you win the game. Tournament betting sites most often support console games compatible with PlayStation, Xbox, Wii, Nintendo and on your computer, so virtually all games you can think of. Skin Betting & In-Game Money Options To evade law restrictions, the online gaming betting industry has now evolved to offer betting on skins or in-game items that can increase the characters’ powers and chances for winning. This gambling innovation is most often associated with Counter-Strike: Global Offensive’s virtual gun market, also known as Valve Corporation’s Community Market, where players around the world sell items to one another on auctions for profit. Due to the spread of unauthorized sites, skin betting is negatively associated with black market dealings and many government authorities recommend against it, as it is deemed unsafe. Gamers continue to explore the option, as they see the opportunity for making easy money from their already won low-value skin. For the curious, our recommendation is to take extra caution and bet only on Valve’s main site. Bear in mind that Valve is making 15% profit of every time you win a new skin on a site, using its API. Pay Attention to Entry Fees, Virtual Currencies & Tokens Knowing the rules of the videogames you choose to play for real money and having developed some amazing skills is certainly not a bullet-proof strategy when wagering your own finances. Some console betting games use tokens that are not convertible to real dollars, other providers prefer to complicate things even further by including virtual currencies such as Bitcoin. To spare you the confusion, stick to more traditional betting sites where you open an account and pay a minimum entry fee, with the option to cash out as soon as your game has finished.

870,Emerging market tech stock boom gives fund managers a headache,"FILE PHOTO: An employee is seen behind a glass wall with the logo of Alibaba at the company's headquarters on the outskirts of Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, April 23, 2014. REUTERS/Chance Chan/File Photo
LONDON (Reuters) - The boom in emerging market technology stocks is becoming a problem for fund managers of all stripes.
The soaring market capitalization of a handful of companies such as China’s Alibaba (BABA.N) and Tencent (0700.HK) is steadily lifting their weighting in the MSCI emerging equities index .MSCIEF.
This means investors in funds that track indexes (exchange traded funds or ETFs) - who want exposure to a range of companies for a lower fund management fee - are finding themselves increasingly exposed to a single sector.
Meanwhile, active fund managers, who justify charging higher fees for their individual stock-picking expertise, are under pressure to buy those tech stocks to ensure their funds keep up with the index’s gains.
And with both sets of investor chasing the same thing, the risk of dramatic outflows increases if the sector falters.
“It’s the opposite of what you are trying to do with an ETF - you want cheap diversified exposure but you end up being concentrated in basically 10 stocks,” said Rory McPherson, head of investment strategy at Psigma, who holds active EM funds.
The biggest five emerging market companies in the index are tech firms Alibaba, Tencent, Samsung (005930.KS), Naspers (NPNJn.J) and Taiwan Semiconductor (5425.TWO).
They comprise almost 19 percent of the index's market capitalization. That is a bigger chunk than the S&P 500 where the top five firms - Alphabet (GOOGL.O) , Apple (AAPL.OQ), Facebook (FB.O), Microsoft (MSFT.OQ), and Amazon (AMZN.OQ) - make up 13 percent .SPX.
The increasing use of ETFs has helped boost valuations further because they must follow the index weighting.
And the index’s concentration has intensified as valuations rose - the five companies’ share was 13.9 percent in January.
DISCOMFORT
The shift toward passive investing, evident across most asset classes, has come into focus in emerging equities, which have enjoyed a sparkling 60 percent rally since early-2016. But the sector may also illustrate the concentration risks that exchange-traded funds can bring to portfolios.
Emerging equity funds have received some $56 billion so far this year, Lipper data shows. Of this, $23 billion went into ETFs.
Investors are keen on tech companies which are making profits by disrupting the status quo in sectors from media and advertising to retail and industrials.
But the dependence on technology for returns is causing some discomfort among investors who prefer shares in emerging market car or beverage makers for instance for exposure to consumer demand in the developing world.
Ed Kerschner, chief portfolio strategist at Columbia Threadneedle, says the tech companies’ performance mostly reflects that of their U.S. peers rather than providing exposure to developing countries.
“The question is are you buying emerging markets or are you buying technology?” Kerschner said. “The risk of buying EM benchmarks is that you are not diversifying away from the S&P.”
As a result of the tech rally, the conventional market-cap weighted emerging equity index, with bigger weightings in companies with the largest market caps, has begun strongly outperforming the index where all companies are assigned the same weighting.
The success can also be reversed. Any faltering by the tech leaders would have a proportionally weighty effect on ETFs, potentially spurring big outflows.
Scott Snyder, co-portfolio manager of the ICON emerging markets fund, estimates that the four biggest tech firms have accounted for a third of 2017’s emerging equity returns.
“A lot of people that might just be piling into passive strategies in EM could be overly exposed to technology right now,” ICON’s Snyder said.
THE “WRONG” REASON
There are also signs that many active emerging market managers, who would have had more diverse investments than ETF funds, are sticking more closely to the benchmark.
Data from Copley Fund Research shows the average active share of global emerging market funds - the extent to which their holdings differ from the index - has fallen to 74.7 percent from a peak of 78 percent in April 2016.
Partly this is due to the addition in May 2016 of U.S.-listed Chinese firms to the emerging benchmark - because active investors held these stocks before their inclusion in the index - but competition from ETFs may also play a role.
“The effect of rising ETF flows and narrowing breadth has been to push active investors to get closer to their benchmarks,” said Edward Cole, a portfolio manager at GLG Man Group.
Even among active managers, many may be holding tech stocks for the “wrong” reason - fear of underperforming the index, said Kiran Nandra-Koehrer, senior product specialist in Pictet Asset Management’s emerging equities team.
While many investors are wary of paying higher fees for funds to replicate the index, active managers don’t want to risk missing out on meaty returns from tech.
A streak of losses and fund closures remains fresh in their mind, with 746 emerging market funds liquidated in the last five years, according to Lipper data.
But Psigma’s McPherson cited one of his holdings, Mirabaud’s Emerging Markets fund, which has returned over 33 percent this year, outgunning the MSCI index’s 29 percent. That shows an active manager can overcome concentration risks.
“We would rather our active managers weight to the small tech companies that are better value,” McPherson said.",fake

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Shares of cinema stocks dropped on Monday after domestic opening weekend ticket sales for science fiction sequel “Blade Runner 2049” fell short of expectations, the latest disappointment following an underwhelming U.S. summer movie season.
AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc, Regal Entertainment Group and Cinemark Holdings Inc were all down, with price target cuts by Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter also weighing on the shares.
Third-quarter domestic box office sales would be lower than previously expected, Pachter said in a report, “as several titles in the summer release slate failed to resonate with moviegoers.”
AMC fell 7.7 percent to $14.02, Regal Entertainment was down 4.4 percent at $16.04 and Cinemark lost 3.53 percent to $36.35.
“Blade Runner 2049” starring Ryan Gosling and Harrison Ford pulled in $33 million in North America, according to Warner Bros.
That compared to an expected range of $45 million to $50 million, despite positive reviews and the popularity of the original 1982 “Blade Runner,” according to a report by Variety.com.
Other recent movies have fallen short of expectations, including “King Arthur: Legend of the Sword” and “Baywatch,” in a slow U.S. summer movie season that underscored the trend of more consumers watching entertainment online.
Wedbush’s Pachter cut his price target on AMC to $20.50 from 22.75 and lowered his target for Regal Entertainment to $19 from $23. He cut his target for Cinemark to $42 from $44.",fake

— Check the injury report before putting these players in your line-up: Sam Bradford, Marcus Mariota, Derek Carr, DaVante Adams, Ty Montgomery, Michael Crabtree
— Waiver wire pick-ups for the week: Alvin Kamara (RB/NO) he should be owned in every league by now, Latavius Murray (RB/Min), Andre Ellington (RB/Ari), Aaron Jones (RB/GB), C.J. Prosise (RB/Sea), Will Fuller (WR/Hou), Tyler Kroft (TE/Cin)
— Stop wasting a roster spot on Adrian Peterson; he can be dropped. Terrance West can be dropped as well.
— Doug Martin is back from suspension this week. While many owners have been waiting for him to return, there is no guarantee he will be active.
— Willie Snead should be active this week.
— Mitchell Trubisky will start for the Bears.
— Bye weeks start this week with the following teams: Atlanta, Denver, New Orleans, and Washington
— New England at Tampa Bay kicks us off on Thursday night.
— Minnesota at Chicago closes the week Monday night.
Ravens Fantasy Outlook
Ravens Defense: Derek Carr is out, Michael Crabtree’s status is up in the air and if he does play he may not be 100%. Then you have Amari Cooper and Marshawn Lynch, who have disappeared over the past three weeks. This has all the makings for the Ravens defense to have a big fantasy day.
Ben Watson: The Raiders have allowed 14+ fantasy points to opposing TE’s in three of the past four games.
Jeremy Maclin: Maclin has some familiarity with the Raiders defense from his time in Kansas City. While there Maclin faced them four times and averaged 11 points per game (PPR scoring).
Buy
QB: Phillip Rivers: Just because your team is 0-4 doesn’t mean you cannot be relevant in fantasy. Rivers has attempted 30+ passes in all four games this year and has thrown for over 1,100 yards.
Eli Manning: In his last two games, Manning has averaged 327 yards to go with five TD’s. The passing game is finally starting to get in sync.
Other names: Tom Brady, Jameis Winston, Carson Wentz, Aaron Rodgers, DeShaun Watson, Matthew Stafford
RB: Jordan Howard: Howard’s workload will increase this week with a rookie QB starting. He should get plenty of chances on the ground and in the passing game.
Ezekiel Elliott: Elliott feasted on the Pack twice last year rushing for 157 and 125 yards. He has rebounded nicely since Week 2 and another 100+ yard game is likely.
Other names: LeSean McCoy, Bilal Powell, Carlos Hyde, LeGarrette Blount, Leonard Fournette, Le’Veon Bell, Todd Gurley, Kareem Hunt
WR: Mike Evans: The Pats defense is dead last in passing defense and as allowed 1300 yards and 11 TD’s through the air. This is an ideal match-up for one of the best receivers in the league at home.
Jordy Nelson: Nelson has averaged 22 points per game in the three games he has played. That number could increase this week as both Adams and Montgomery may miss the game.
Other names: Brandin Cooks, Chris Hogan, A.J. Green, Golden Tate, T.Y. Hilton, DeVante Parker, Keenan Allen, Odell Beckham, Jr., Larry Fitzgerald, Antonio Brown, Dez Bryant, DeAndre Hopkins, Stefon Diggs, Robby Anderson, Jordy Nelson
TE: Rob Gronkowski: Gronk has averaged 16 fantasy points a game and is leading the team in targets.
Delanie Walker: In the two games Matt Cassel started last year, he targeted Walker eight times in each game. Walker will be a security blanket for whomever is playing QB this week.
Other names: Cameron Brate, Charles Clay, Zach Ertz, Travis Kelce
Def: Minnesota, Tennessee, Detroit, New York Jets
Sell
QB: Andy Dalton: The Bills defense has allowed one passing TD while hauling in six INT’s and giving up 229 yards on average through the air.
Cam Newton: In Detroit’s two home games this year they have picked off opposing QB’s six times. That is not a good sign for Newton who has already thrown five INT’s.
Other names: Jay Cutler, Blake Bortles, E.J. Manuel
RB: Marshawn Lynch: Lynch has scored a combined three fantasy points over the past two weeks. Lynch has just not be able to get it going since Week 1.
Christian McCaffrey: Take away the Saints game and McCaffrey has averaged nine points a week. To make matters worse, he has yet to find the end zone.
Other names: Jay Ajayi, Eddie Lacy, Joe Mixon, Chris Johnson
WR: Jarvis Landry: His targets and yards have decreased each week and Jay Cutler’s play has hurt his fantasy stock.
Eric Decker: Decker has yet to top 50 yards in a game or find the end zone. That will not improve with Cassel or a less than 100% Mariota on the road this week.
Other names: Kelvin Benjamin, Allen Hurns, Amari Cooper, Torrey Smith, Eric Decker, Martavis Bryant, Doug Baldwin
TE: Jason Witten: In the past two games, Witten has seen only six targets, hauling in two for 12 yards.
Julius Thomas: Thomas is averaging five points per game. With the offense sputtering, things don’t look good going forward.
Other names: Kyle Rudolph, Jimmy Graham
Def: New England, Tampa Bay, Seattle, Houston
Steals
QB: Jacoby Brisett: Brisett has not been horrible and he gets a favorable match-up at home against the 49ers, who have allowed seven touchdowns through the air.
RB: Andre Ellington: Ellington is extremely valuable in PPR leagues, but look for his role to expand with Chris Johnson adding nothing to the offense.
WR: Zay Jones: With Jordan Matthews out for a month, Jones steps in as the number one WR.
TE: Austin Seferian-Jenkins: ASJ is averaging 8.5 points since returning from suspension. With his role expanding each week, he is in line for a big game against the Browns.
Def: Buffalo Bills

1579,College Football: Mel Kiper and Todd Mcshay’s List of Most Exciting Players to Watch,"College Football: Mel Kiper and Todd Mcshay’s List of Most Exciting Players to Watch
(Before It's News)
.
It has been argued that scouting takes the joy out of football. Sometimes it is fun to simply watch a game unfold and to enjoy the athleticism of the players without losing oneself in their potential as future NFL stars.
Mel Kiper and Todd McShay spend their days looking at young talent, and they know how to spot a future NFL star. However, the players they have listed below have less to do with how they would have impacted the college football lines for Week 5 games and more to do with the fun they bring to the game.
If you are looking for talented athletes that are merely fun to watch, consider these guys:
+Saquon Barkley
As far as PSU Running Backs are concerned, Saquon is something special, at least on the college level. Forget about Leonard Fournette, this is a 230-pound player that makes lateral cuts he shouldn’t be capable of. With amazing breakaway speed, Saquon makes waves in every game in which he plays.
+Baker Mayfield
This Oklahoma QB’s future in the NFL is a little uncertain. But when you see him run around for fifteen seconds only to throw the ball downfield, you will quickly forget about all the whining surrounding his small size and lacking arm strength. You know he will be in the Heisman conversation this season.
+Sam Darnold
This USC QB is the total package. Not only is he a team player, availing his receivers the opening to make plays but he has a way of using his physical prowess to extend plays, utilizing the entire field and countering any argument being made about his interceptions.
Darnold doesn’t look anything like a sophomore when he’s on the field.
+Damien Harris
Everyone that kept crying about this Alabama RB not being on par with 5-star recruits like Josh Jacobs has been forced to eat their words. Harris doesn’t look like he’s anything special until you see the consistent reliability he brings to the table. Harris always performs at his best regardless of the conditions or the challenger.
+Christian Kirk
It isn’t just his stats (19 catches, 250 yards, 4 touchdowns) that make this Texas A&M WR such a catch. Besides speed and agility, Kirk is always willing to go over the muddle.
+Devin Bush
This Michigan LB is following in the footsteps of his father (who was scouted in 1995) by lining up all over the field, making so many plays and proving to his naysayers why he might be better than Maurice Hurst. You won’t find that many sophomores that hit so hard.
+Roquan Smith
This Georgia ILB has been compared to C.J. Mosley and Coach Kirby Smart agrees. Georgia’s defense is pretty loaded and yet Smith has found a way to stand out.
+Hercules Mata’afa
This Washington State DE is versatile. That is his strength. Comparable to the likes of Deone Bucannon and already boasting 4.5 sacks so far in the new season, the athlete has shown an incredible ability to play on his feet and on the edge.
If you’ve been paying close attention to college football, then you know that there’s a lot of talent to marvel at, from Ben Banogu of TCU to Deatrick Nichols of South Florida and Elijah Marks of Northern Arizona.
But the names above tend to stand out for Kiper and McShay.

2833,"U.S. President Donald Trump Quietly Signs Law To Allow Warrantless Searches In Parts Of VA, DC and MD","By Aaron Kesel
As former White House chief of staff and current Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel has said: “You never let a serious crisis go to waste.” While everyone was worried about the hurricanes, U.S. President Donald Trump signed away the Fourth Amendment buried in a new bill. He set a precedent by empowering the police state to allow warrantless searches in parts of VA, MD and D.C. near the Metro train system.
The government can now openly enter and search private property without a warrant in parts of Virginia, Maryland and D.C.
The House Joint Resolution 76 was signed into law on Tuesday, Aug. 22, by President Trump. The text is rather boring, starting off with: “Granting the consent and approval of Congress for the Commonwealth of Virginia, the State of Maryland, and the District of Columbia to enter into a compact relating to the establishment of the Washington Metrorail Safety Commission.”
CNN explained, “This law lets Virginia, Maryland and the District of Columbia form a new panel called the Washington Metrorail Safety Commission to oversee the safety of the D.C.-area public transportation Metro train system.”
The new safety commission will take over from the current Federal Transit Agency (FTA), which has been in charge of safety oversight for the Washington Metropolitan Area Interstate Compact (WMATA) since October 2015.
“We’ll set this up and get the FTA out of Metro. They are happy to get out, and we’re happy to get them out,” Metro Board of Directors Chair Jack Evans told Bloomberg BNA. “I’m glad we got this thing. If nothing else, we’ll get our money.”
However, buried within the bill’s text is a daunting “one major red flag” that would give the newly formed commission “the authority to enter property near the Metro Rail System ‘without limitation’ and without a warrant, for the purpose of ‘making inspections, investigations, examinations, and testing,” The Free Thought Project reported.
The legislation reads:
In performing its duties, the Commission, through its Board or designated employees or agents, may: Enter upon the WMATA Rail System and, upon reasonable notice and a finding by the chief executive officer that a need exists, upon any lands, waters, and premises adjacent to the WMATA Rail System, including, without limitation, property owned or occupied by the federal government, for the purpose of making inspections, investigations, examinations, and testing as the Commission may deem necessary to carry out the purposes of this MSC Compact, and such entry shall not be deemed a trespass.
Only five Congressman voted against the bill according to U.S. Rep Justin Amash (R-Mich.) while three hundred ninety-nine gave their approval, and 29 didn’t bother to vote at all. Apparently, our elected officials can’t be bothered to stand up for the rights of we the people or the Constitution they swore to protect. After all, the Fourth Amendment doesn’t exist, which protects Americans from unreasonable searches and seizures or anything. As Amash pointed out, the government will now be able to kick in the doors of any private property surrounding the border of the DC Metro Rail System without needing a warrant based on any probable cause.
Only 5 of us voted against bill allowing govt to enter/search private property in parts of VA, MD & DC w/o warrant. https://t.co/SVhTWqbPaB — Justin Amash (@justinamash) July 18, 2017
A scary prospect indeed, as Rachel Blevins wrote for The Free Thought Project, “While it may only affect the Washington, D.C., metro area now, it could be laying the blueprint for future legislation across the country.”

The final round of World Cup qualifying is taking place, and 14 countries are already assured of their places alongside hosts Russia at next summer's 32-team tournament.
Five-time winners Brazil are there, as are defending champions Germany, plus Belgium, Costa Rica, England, Egypt, Iran, Japan, Mexico, Nigeria, Poland, Saudi Arabia, South Korea and Spain.
So how did they get there? Who will be their star performers? And who are the coaches who masterminded their qualification?
BBC Sport finds out more...
EUROPE
Russia (hosts)
Pedigree: Stanislav Cherchesov's side will be the fourth Russia team to play at a World Cup - they first appeared at USA '94 - although the Soviet Union had finished fourth in 1966.
Spotlight on the hosts All of Russia's 2017 Confederations Cup squad played their club football in their homeland
Key player: Veteran goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev has won more than 100 caps and his experience could be vital. The 31-year-old, who has spent his entire career at CSKA Moscow, is likely to captain the hosts.
Premier League players: None.
Who's the boss? Cherchesov rallied behind his side after the Confederations Cup, saying his players would ""mature"" because of the experience. A former Soviet Union and Russia goalkeeper, he has been given the target of reaching the semi-finals next summer.
Belgium
Pedigree: Having failed to qualify for the previous two tournaments, Belgium reached the quarter-finals at Brazil 2014, losing to eventual runners-up Argentina. The Red Devils' best finish was fourth in 1986.
Eden Hazard made his Belgium debut as a 17-year-old in 2008
Key player: Eden Hazard. The twinkle-toed Chelsea forward unlocks defences with his rapid change of pace, close control and eye for a pass. He also wears the captain's armband for Roberto Martinez's side.
Premier League players: Michy Batshuayi, Thibaut Courtois, Eden Hazard (all Chelsea), Simon Mignolet (Liverpool), Toby Alderweireld, Moussa Dembele, Jan Vertonghen, (all Tottenham), Kevin de Bruyne, Vincent Kompany (both Manchester City), Marouane Fellaini, Romelu Lukaku (both Manchester United), Steven Defour (Burnley), Nacer Chadli (West Brom), Kevin Mirallas (Everton), Christian Benteke (Crystal Palace), Divock Origi (Wolfsburg, on loan from Liverpool), Christian Kabasele (Watford).
Who's the boss? Roberto Martinez's greatest achievement in English football was guiding Wigan to FA Cup success in 2013, although they were relegated three days later.
The former Swansea and Everton manager's prowess in organising an attack has never been in question, but there were concerns over his defensive aptitude at club level. That shouldn't be a problem with this Belgium outfit, who have the likes of Tottenham defenders Jan Vertonghen and Toby Alderweireld, and Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany in their ranks.
England
Pedigree: Since their solitary World Cup success in 1966, England have reached the semi-finals only once - in 1990, when they finished fourth. Four years ago, the Three Lions were knocked out in the group stage. That was the first time since 1958 they failed to get out of their group, and the only time they have been eliminated after just two matches.
England failed to progress from the group stages of the World Cup in 2014
Key player: With 13 goals for club and country in September, Harry Kane is one of the world's most in-form strikers. His 27 goals in 2017 puts him only nine behind Lionel Messi.
Premier League players: The entire England squad play in the Premier League.
Who's the boss? Gareth Southgate will take charge of his first major tournament. England have lost twice under his stewardship - to Germany and France - and are unbeaten in qualification.
Germany
Pedigree: The defending champions, four-time winners and number one team in the world.
Toni Kroos has scored 12 goals in 78 appearances for Germany
Key player: Toni Kroos. Apart from Thomas Muller and Mesut Ozil, the Real Madrid midfielder is the most experienced player in the squad and keeps things ticking over. Since helping Germany win the 2014 World Cup, he has won two Champions League titles, one La Liga title and two Fifa Club World Cup titles.
Premier League players: Shkodran Mustafi (Arsenal), Antonio Rudiger (Chelsea), Emre Can (Liverpool), Ilkay Gundogan (Manchester City), Mesut Ozil (Arsenal), Leroy Sane (Manchester City).
Who's the boss? Joachim Low. Worked as assistant manager to Jurgen Klinsmann from 2004 to 2006, before being given the top job. The 57-year-old guided Germany to victory in the 2014 World Cup final against Argentina, and also triumphed at the Confederations Cup last year.
The international clean sweep has eluded him, though, with Germany runners-up at Euro 2008 and third four years later.
Poland
Pedigree: Poland are ranked sixth in the world. Have never won the World Cup but many believe this is one of the country's strongest squads. Their highest previous finish is third, which they achieved in 1974 and 1982.
Bayern Munich forward Lewandowsk will be appearing for a World Cup for the first time in Russia
Key player: Bayern Munich forward Robert Lewandowski has scored 16 goals in nine qualifying matches for Poland and is their all time record goal-scorer. The skipper has scored a total of 51 international goals in 91 games.
Premier League players: Lukasz Fabianski (Swansea), Grzegorz Krychowiak (West Bromwich Albion), Kamil Grosicki (Hull City)
Championship players: Pawel Wszolek (Queens Park Rangers)
Who's the boss? Adam Nawalka has been in charge since November 2013 and has overseen 39 matches as Poland manager. His contract is due to run out in December but he guided the team to the quarter-finals of Euro 2016, just two years after they failed to qualify for the 2014 World Cup, so he is expected to remain in charge for his second major tournament.
Spain
Pedigree: Currently ranked 11 in the world. They held the number one spot from 2008 until 2013. Spain were world champions in 2010, as well as European champions in 2008 and 2012.
Isco scored two goals in Spain's 3-0 win over Italy in February
Key player: Real Madrid attacking midfielder Isco has been in fine form during qualifying, with six goals and an assist in Spain's past seven matches. He has seven goals in 23 appearances in his international career.
Premier League players: Juan Mata (Manchester United), Nacho Monreal (Arsenal), Alvaro Morata (Chelsea), David de Gea (Manchester United), Cesar Azpilicueta (Chelsea), Ander Herrera (Manchester United), Pedro (Chelsea), David Silva (Manchester City).
Who's the boss? Julen Lopetegui was appointed in July 2016 and remains unbeaten in 13 matches in charge. He has won the European Championships with Spain's U21s and U19s, although he has never coached a side at a senior major tournament.
SOUTH AMERICA
Brazil
Pedigree: Winners in 1958, 1962, 1970, 1994 and 2002, Brazil were beaten 7-1 at the semi-final stage by Germany last time out.
Paris St-Germain forward Neymar is the world's most expensive footballer
Key player: Neymar. The £200m forward is averaging a goal and an assist a game since his world-record move to Paris St-Germain. Brazil legend Pele says the 25-year-old is the country's best player and has backed him to win the Ballon d'Or.
Premier League players: Ederson, Fernandinho, Gabriel Jesus (all Manchester City), Philippe Coutinho, Roberto Firmino (both Liverpool), Willian (Chelsea).
Who's the boss? Brazil were sixth with a third of the qualifying campaign gone when journeyman coach Tite replaced former Brazil midfielder Dunga. The former Corinthians boss, 56, has since guided his country 11 points clear of Colombia with three games to go.
""What a difference a coach makes. Out went the snarling Dunga and in came Tite - charismatic and intelligent - and he made an immediate impact,"" South American football expert Tim Vickery told BBC Radio 5 live.
NORTH, CENTRAL AMERICA and CARIBBEAN
Mexico
Pedigree: Mexico have reached the knockout stage in each of the past six World Cups, and made the quarter-finals as hosts in 1986.
Key player: Hirving Lozano has scored three goals in three games since leaving Pachuca for PSV Eindhoven this summer, and the 22-year-old is also becoming the star of the national team, netting Mexico's winner against Panama.
'Chucky' even impressed Argentina legend Diego Maradona on his Eredivisie debut, and the Philips Stadion crowd gave the winger a standing ovation following his first goal for PSV.
Premier League players: Javier Hernandez (West Ham).
Who's the boss? Former Manchester City assistant manager Juan Carlos Osorio is the man in charge, but missed his side's Gold Cup campaign this summer after being given a six-match ban by Fifa for ""using insulting words and displaying an aggressive attitude towards officials"" during the Confederations Cup.
The Colombian, who graduated from Liverpool John Moores University with a diploma in science and football, has been backed by a number of experienced players in his squad following criticism from fans.
Costa Rica
Pedigree: Russia 2018 will be the fifth time Los Ticos have appeared at a World Cup finals. Last time out in Brazil, they finished top of a group containing Uruguay, Italy, and bottom-placed England, before going out in the quarter-finals on penalties to the Netherlands.
Key player: Bologna defender Giancarlo Gonzalez made the BBC pundits' team of the tournament in 2014, but the man on whom Costa Rica's recent success is built is Keylor Navas. The 30-year-old goalkeeper's performances at the last World Cup earned him a move to Real Madrid. Since then he has firmly established himself as the number one there, winning one Spanish league title and two Champions Leagues.
Navas celebrates qualifying for the 2018 World Cup
Premier League players: Arsenal striker Joel Campbell is Costa Rica's only Premier League player - though he is on a season-long loan at La Liga side Real Betis.
Who's the boss? Oscar Ramirez was a player when Costa Rica made their World Cup debut in 1990. Since ending his playing career and moving into coaching, he has carved out a reputation for being tactically astute and creative, winning several league titles in club football before taking over from Paulo Wanchope, who resigned after being involved in a brawl during a match against Panama, at the helm of the national side in 2015.
ASIA
Iran
Pedigree: This is the fifth time Iran have qualified for a World Cup, but their only victory in the tournament remains a 2-1 win over the United States at France '98.
Carlos Queiroz has led Iran to back-to-back World Cups
Key player: Striker Sardar Azmoun is arguably Asia's best striker since his compatriot Ali Daei, who scored more international goals than any other male player. The 22-year-old Azmoun is strong with both feet, and in the air, and plays his club football for Russian side Rubin Kazan.
Premier League players: None
Who's the boss? Carlos Queiroz has a CV to rival any manager in international football. Via Sporting Lisbon, South Africa, Real Madrid, Sir Alex Ferguson's assistant at Manchester United and two stints in charge of Portugal, it is with Iran that Queiroz has spent the past six years.
""They fight for their lives, they fight for history, they fight for their reputations,"" said the Portuguese, having seen Iran become the highest-placed Asian side in Fifa's rankings at 24th.
Japan
Pedigree: Mainstays in the competition since 1998, Japan have twice reached the second round, including in 2002 when they jointly hosted the tournament with South Korea.
Key player: Keisuke Honda, Shinji Kagawa and Leicester forward Shinji Okazaki will of course be key, but a young forward on the books at Arsenal could be leading the line come next summer.
Takuma Asano has already netted three times for his country and helped Stuttgart win promotion to the Bundesliga last season while on loan from the Gunners. Arsene Wenger has called the 22-year-old ""a talented young striker and very much one for the future"".
Premier League players: Maya Yoshida (Southampton), Shinji Okazaki (Leicester City), Takuma Asano (Stuttgart, on loan from Arsenal).
Who's the boss? Vahid Halilhodzic, although that could change come the finals if reports of unrest in the camp are true. The Bosnian, however, has already proved his worth on the World Cup stage by leading Algeria to the knockout stages for the first time in the country's history in 2014.
The former Yugoslavia forward has also coached teams such as Paris St-Germain, Dinamo Zagreb and the Ivory Coast.
Nasser Al Shamrani has 19 goals in 77 caps for Saudi
Saudi Arabia
Pedigree: Saudi Arabia's only victories at a World Cup came in their first appearance in 1994, when they won two group matches and reached the second round. Their second win - 1-0 against Belgium - featured one of the greatest goals of all time when forward Saeed Al Owairan ran from his own half and beat half the Belgian defence to score.
Key player: Veteran striker Nasser Al Shamrani will play a vital role. The 2014 Asian Player of the Year can be a bit volatile - he was once banned for eight games for spitting at Western Sydney Wanderers player Matthew Spiranovic before trying to headbutt him after his Al Hilal side lost in the 2014 Champions League final.
Premier League players: None
Who's the boss? Bert van Marwijk, who has been in charge since 2015. The Dutchman, 65, led the Netherlands to the 2010 World Cup final and has coached the likes of Borussia Dortmund, Feyenoord and Hamburg.
South Korea
Pedigree: No Asian team has a better World Cup pedigree than the side nicknamed the Taegeuk Warriors. South Korea's goalless draw against Uzbekistan secured a place at a 10th finals and the tournament in Russia will be the ninth World Cup in a row in which they have featured.
Lee Dong-gook will be 39 by the time the World Cup begins in Russia
Key player: Son Heung-min has showcased his trickery at Tottenham and is the stand-out name on the team sheet. He has managed just one international goal since the start of 2016 however, as the side have struggled in front of goal. And keep an eye out for Lee Dong-gook who came on as a substitute in their final qualifier and will be 39 by the time the World Cup comes around. The former Middlesbrough striker boasts 105 caps spanning 19 years.
Premier League players: Ki Sung-yueng (Swansea), Son Heung-min (Tottenham)
Who is the boss? Shin Tae-yong has been nicknamed 'the Asian Mourinho' but he has come under pressure as a result of their hit-and-miss displays in qualifying. However, having only taken charge in July, he is likely to be given time to get things right. The 48-year-old spent 12 years as a player in South Korea's K-League and then made a single league appearance in Australia before retiring in 2005.
AFRICA
Egypt
Pedigree: Egypt are currently 30th in Fifa's world rankings - one place below Netherlands. Having missed out on the 2010 and 2014 competitions after play-off defeats, they qualified for Russia when Liverpool's Mohamed Salah scored a dramatic injury-time winner against Congo on 8 October. Their last notable success at a major tournament was in 2010, when they lifted the Africa Cup of Nations for the seventh time.
Mohamed Salah will be making his World Cup debut in Russia
Key player: Mohamed Salah, Liverpool's major summer signing, is Egypt's most talented player. The speedy forward has scored 32 goals in 56 international appearances, including five during qualifying for Russia.
Premier League players: Mohamed Salah (Liverpool), Mohamed Elneny (Arsenal), Ahmed Hegazy (West Brom), Ramadan Sobhi (Stoke),
Championship players: Ahmed Elmohamady (Aston Villa)
League One players: Sam Morsy (Wigan),
Who's the boss? Argentine Hector Cuper, who previously coached Valencia and Inter Milan, was appointed in March 2015. He also managed Georgia between 2008 and 2009. His only major tournament was the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations - where Egypt were defeated 2-1 in the final by Cameroon.
Nigeria
Pedigree: This will be Nigeria's sixth appearance at a World Cup - and their third in a row. They have reached the last 16 three times - 1994, 1998 and 2014 - but have never advanced beyond that stage.
Key player: Captain John Mikel Obi, the most experienced member of the squad with 80 caps, will be a key figure for the Super Eagles in Russia. This will be the former Chelsea midfielder's second World Cup - the 30-year-old helped the team reach the knockout stages in 2014 for the first time since 1998. He now plies his trade in China with Tianjin Teda.
John Mikel Obi helped Nigeria win the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations
Premier League players: Alex Iwobi (Arsenal), Victor Moses (Chelsea), Kelechi Iheanacho (Leicester City), Wilfred Ndidi (Leicester City), Ahmed Musa (Leicester City) and Ola Aina (on loan at Hull City from Chelsea).
Who is the boss? Gernot Rohr has managed all over the world. From Nice to Gabon, Burkina Faso to Nigeria, the 64-year-old German has extensive knowledge. Rohr played at Bayern Munich and Bordeaux. He then coached Bordeaux when they lost to Bayern in the 1996 Uefa Cup final. Previous managerial jobs also include French club Nantes, Young Boys Berne in Switzerland, Tunisian side Etoile du Sahel and the Niger national team.",fake

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Prisoners and authorities clash in northern Mexico
The UN has called for investigation into a prison riot in Mexico that left more than a dozen people dead.
The death toll rose to 17 on Wednesday night following clashes inside Cadereyta jail in Nuevo Leon state earlier in the week.
The UN cited other recent prison revolts as a reason for a ""complete and exhaustive"" report .
State authorities said they are open to cooperating with human rights organisations.
They previously said lethal force was needed to regain full control of the facility, near Monterrey.
About 250 inmates battled security forces during the disturbance, local media report.
A UN statement urged authorities ""to clarify the tragedy that has occurred and to grant justice to the victims and their families"", according to El Universal newspaper.
""Do you want somebody responsible? I am responsible,"" state security spokesperson Aldo Fasci told reporters.

He said attempts to mediate with inmates who took three guards hostage had failed.
However, he insisted no direct orders were given to start shooting. Officers were following protocol, he said.
He also said a police officer had a lung seriously injured when a prisoner attacked him with a ""rod"".
The UN statement referenced a 2016 a riot at Topo Chico prison, which left 49 people dead, and another violent outbreak at Apodaca prison in 2012, where 44 people died. Both prisons are in Nuevo Leon state.
Mexican prisons are often criticised for overcrowding and an inability to tackle violence between rival gangs.",fake
3360,Brooklyn Nine-Nine actor Terry Crews says executive molested him,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Terry Crews (right) says he was with his wife Rebecca (left) when the alleged incident occurred at a Hollywood function last year
US actor Terry Crews has said he was sexually molested by a Hollywood executive last year.
In a series of tweets, Crews said the executive, whom he did not name, had groped his ""privates"" in front of Crews's wife at a function.
But the actor said he had neither retaliated nor taken further action as he had feared repercussions.
Crews said he had been spurred to speak out by the claims of sexual harassment made against producer Harvey Weinstein.
Weinstein lost his job and his wife has left him after actresses made a string of allegations against him.
Crews is a former football player who went into acting in the 1990s and is currently appearing in the Fox sitcom Brooklyn Nine-Nine. He is married with five children.
Crews said Weinstein was not the man who had allegedly assaulted him.
The executive in question ""knows who he is"", he said, and had apologised for his behaviour. But Crews appeared not to discount future action against him, saying ""sumtimes Uhav2 wait & compare notes w/ others who've been victimized in order 2gain a position of strength"".
Crews began his thread of 16 tweets by saying the ""thing with Harvey Weinstein is giving me PTSD"" (post-traumatic stress disorder):

3632,'Loving Vincent' brings Van Gogh's art alive,"(Reuters) - You have seen his “Sunflowers” in a museum, sung along with Don McLean to “Vincent (Starry Starry Night)” and gawped at the tens of million of dollars his works have fetched at auction.
But you have never seen Vincent Van Gogh’s art quite like it is shown in the film “Loving Vincent.”
Seven years in the making and billed as the world’s first fully-painted feature film, “Loving Vincent” uses more than 130 of the Dutch artist’s own paintings to tell his own story.
Each of the 65,000 frames of the animated independent film, created by Polish artist and animator Dorota Kobiela, is an oil painting hand painted by 125 professional artists who traveled from around the world to be a part of the project.
“It looks like something completely different, and that doesn’t happen very often in our media-saturated world,” said Hugh Welchman, who co-wrote and directed the film with Kobiela.
“Loving Vincent,” showing in limited release in New York and Los Angeles and arriving in Europe in October, was first filmed with actors playing some of the people Van Gogh captured on canvas.
They include Saiorse Ronan as doctor’s daughter Marguerite Gachet and Chris O‘Dowd as postman Joseph Roulin, who walk through and inhabit his paintings as his story unfolds.
Then came the hard part. Finding and training the painters to reproduce Van Gogh’s work.
FILE PHOTO: Visitors take pictures with their mobile phone of the painting ""Portrait de l'Artiste, 1889"" (Self-Portrait) by artist Vincent van Gogh (1853-1890) at the Musee d'Orsay in Paris, France, July 28, 2015. REUTERS/Stephane Mahe
More than 4,000 artists from around the world applied for the job and 125 were chosen and put through three weeks training.
“Even though we were hiring the very best oil painters, Vincent’s style look like it should be very easy but actually it’s difficult to do well,” said Welchman.
“Even after training there were still quite a few painters who really found it impossible to get to grips with his style,” Welchman said.
The $5.5 million production focuses on the last weeks of Van Gogh’s life before his death in 1890 in France at age 37 from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.
Welchman said the film has triggered some unusual responses.
“We’ve had a lot of people in tears at screenings. People are sending poems or making cakes with intricate Vincent paintings on the cake,” he said.
He and Kobiela hope the film encourages audiences to discover more about Van Gogh.
“I’d like them to think there is more to his story than he went mad, cut off his ears, was a genius and did these incredibly colorful paintings that sell for lots of money.”

539,Zak Hardaker: Castleford Tigers full-back banned after positive drugs test,"Media playback is not supported on this device 'Don't mess about with drugs' - McDermott
England and Castleford Tigers full-back Zak Hardaker has been provisionally suspended after testing positive for cocaine and will miss the World Cup.
The 25-year-old was omitted from the Tigers' squad for Saturday's Grand Final loss to Leeds Rhinos and was not named in England's squad on Monday.
Hardaker's failed test came after a Super 8s game against Leeds, his former club, on 8 September.
He could be suspended for two years as a result of his positive test.
In a statement on the club website, Hardaker said: ""I would like to apologise to my team-mates, the staff and all fans for my enormous error of judgment.
""I was given an opportunity by this great club and in what has been one of the most important weeks in its history, I have let everyone at the club down. For that, I truly apologise.
""Finally, I would like to make it clear that in no way did I, nor would I, ever take a substance with the intention of enhancing my performance.""
Hardaker was one of three nominees for Super League's Man of Steel award, having scored 13 tries in 30 games as Tigers won the League Leaders' Shield for the first time, and was expected to be named in the England squad for World Cup in Australia.
""The Rugby Football League can confirm that Zak Hardaker is provisionally suspended from all competition after it received notification from UK Anti-Doping that he had tested positive for a banned substance,"" read a statement from the RFL.
""He will therefore not be considered for the England Rugby League World Cup squad due to be announced on Monday at 12:00 BST.""
The RFL and Castleford said they will be making no further comment until the outcome of the case has been determined.
Hardaker absence 'a big disruption'
Media playback is not supported on this device McGuire stars as Leeds make Grand Final history
Castleford said on Thursday that Hardaker had been left out of their Grand Final squad because of a ""breach of club rules"".
Speaking after Saturday's 24-6 defeat by Leeds at Old Trafford, head coach Daryl Powell said: ""I still thought we had a team out there that could have won the game if we'd played anywhere near our potential.
""But if you take a player like him out of any team, it's going to be a disruption.
""You take your full-back out two days before the game, and you have one session of preparation - it's clearly not going to help.
""It is what it is. There's absolutely nothing we can do about that.""
Castleford, who were without Zak Hardaker, were beaten 24-6 by Leeds in Saturday's Grand Final
On-field brilliance, off-field problems
Hardaker joined Castleford on an initial loan deal for 2017 that was later made permanent, after a stint in Australia with Penrith Panthers.
That brought his six-year spell at Leeds to an end and reunited Hardaker with Powell, who gave him his break at Featherstone Rovers.
At Leeds, Hardaker won three Grand Finals, a Challenge Cup winner's medal and the 2015 Man of Steel prize.
But his on-field brilliance has been marred by off-field problems throughout his career.
He missed out on the 2013 World Cup and was fined by Leeds after he ""acted unprofessionally"", before going on an anger management course following an incident in Leeds during the 2015 season.
'He still has a chance for redemption'
Analysis: BBC rugby league correspondent Dave Woods
If you met Zak Hardaker, your likeliest first impression would be of a lovely lad who is endearingly honest about the mistakes he's made. The problem is that he keeps making those mistakes.
Despite his outstanding rugby league talents that were taking him to the very top in the game, his career is now defined by his wrong choices off the field.
Currently the best English full-back around and tipped to get even better, he will instead be remembered for missing the 2013 World Cup because of a boozy brawl on the eve of the tournament, being effectively kicked out by Leeds for a catalogue of off-field indiscretions and now missing a Grand Final and another World Cup for this latest catastrophic choice of behaviour.
It's incredibly frustrating to team-mates and fans that so much talent has been squandered. But he still has a chance for some redemption.
Without pre-judging any mitigating circumstances he may use in his defence, the probable outcome of this failed drug test is a two-year ban.
He turns 26 in a few days, so he is of an age where he could still return and perform at the highest level again. That depends on how well he is supported and mentored in the next couple of years, though both Leeds and Castleford have done their best in the past.
So more importantly it now comes down to the quality of his own decisions.
In short, it's time for the lad to grow up.",fake
3928,The story not being talked about in Myanmar,"Image copyright EPA Image caption Images of the Rohingya crisis have dominated global headlines for weeks
Looking from Yangon, you would never know that a major humanitarian crisis has been unfolding for more than a month in Myanmar's western region of Rakhine.
More than half a million Rohingya Muslims have fled across the border to Bangladesh since militants attacked police posts on 25 August, unleashing a massive military crackdown.
The Burmese authorities have been under mounting pressure to end the violence, address instability in Rakhine, and grant humanitarian access.
But the country's biggest city is a picture of calm on the surface, with clean roads, plenty of greenery and orderly - if congested - traffic. Well-dressed men and women get on with their daily lives.
People here don't use the term Rohingya. They are portrayed in the media as ""Bengali Muslims"" and some even describe them as illegal Bengali immigrants from Bangladesh.
Image caption Inside Myanmar regular rallies are held in support of Aung San Suu Kyi
When I have raised the Rohingya issue, people were either forthright in their opinion or tried to gloss over the topic, saying ""there are many other issues in this country"".
This includes senior journalists, like U Aung Hla Tun, vice-chairman of the Myanmar Press Council.
""The problem is the political motive behind the term [Rohingya]. I used to have a number of Bengali friends when I was young. They never claimed they were Rohingya… They first coined the term a few decades ago,"" he said.
""They [Rohingya] do not belong to the ethnic minorities [of this country]. This is a fact.""
Rohingya and others dispute that.
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Watch: Who are the Rohingya?
While the crisis has dominated headlines around the world for weeks, newspapers here have hardly any mention of the plight of Rohingya now living in squalid conditions in camps in Bangladesh.
Instead, articles have given prominence to reports of the army finding mass graves of Hindus allegedly killed by Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (Arsa) militants.
At the University of Yangon I wondered if I would find a different mood among students. Their links with the outside world through social media are much better than those from earlier generations.
In the university café some students were reluctant to talk. Some did not want to give their names. But when I broached the Rakhine issue, the response was instant.
""This issue is seen from outside as a religious problem. But it is not. The violence is an act of terrorism. The international community is getting wrong information about the situation in the Rakhine state,"" a female student said.
""From abroad, you think you are right, but from our side we are right.""
Similar views were expressed by two of her friends.
Image copyright Reuters Image caption Rohingya are blamed in Myanmar for burning their own villages in Rakhine state
A few days later I went to a commemorative event marking the 10th anniversary of the 2007 pro-democracy protests. Thousands of Buddhist monks joined the demonstrations, which became widely known as ""the Saffron Revolution"".
The pictures of saffron-clad monks revolting against the military junta caught the world's imagination.
The anniversary event was held inside a monastery in southern Yangon, decorated with banners recalling the momentous protests. Buddhist monks, pro-democracy activists and union members who took part in the 2007 protests turned out in large numbers.
I was expecting that as many of them were former political prisoners, who had been jailed for supporting human rights and democracy, there would have been a divergent view on the Rohingya issue.
Shwe Toontay Sayar Taw was one of the leading monks in the Saffron Revolution. I asked him as a young democracy, isn't it Myanmar's responsibility to treat all communities, including the Rohingya, equally?
""In democracy all are equal,"" he said, adding ""but not terrorists"".
""If they take up terrorism [then] all the people of the world should unite to destroy terrorism. Otherwise they will destroy our generation.""
No doubt the Rohingya Muslim issue has boosted support among the majority Burmese for Aung San Suu Kyi, whose protracted silence over the issue has drawn condemnation from around the world.
Rallies are held in front of the city hall in Yangon supporting the country's de-facto leader.
Senior UN officials have described the violence against Rohingya Muslims as ""ethnic cleansing"" - a charge denied by the Myanmar government.
Where have the Rohingya fled to?
Myanmar has witnessed the mass exodus of people before. In the 1960s, soon after the military seized power, it ordered tens of thousands of people of Indian origin to leave the country.
The Indians had lived in Burma for centuries, and many had been brought to the country by colonial rulers when the country was part of British India, during the 19th and early 20th Centuries.
It is estimated that more than 300,000 people were forced to leave and their properties and lands were nationalised. The Burmese Indian refugees went back to India.
I wondered whether Yangon and the mainstream Burmese media is in a state of denial about the violence against Rohingya Muslims.
A senior editor and a former political prisoner who did not want to be named gave me the answer.
""Everyone is scared and everyone is reluctant to touch on this issue. First, there is security problem in going there [Rakhine state]. So, much of the reporting is based only on official press releases,"" he said.
He pointed out that there is also public pressure.
If you go against the mainstream views, he said, ""even your relatives and friends will dislike you"".",fake

(Before It's News)
You’ve been completing WODs consistently, you’re gradually improving your times, you’re controlling your diet, and you’ve perfected your technique on most if not all of the exercises commonly encountered in CrossFit training.
You probably feel great – in fact, you might feel better than you have in years. You’ve got more energy, more stamina, and more strength, and you probably sleep more soundly than ever.
So, what now? Where can you go from here? It’s time to start thinking about competing.
Preparing for a Competition
Truthfully, nothing can fully prepare you for your first CrossFit competition; it’s something you have to experience to understand. However, it’s important to have a set of guidelines to keep you focused during the event. With so much energy and excitement in the air it’s easy to get sidetracked, and it’s also easy to blow yourself out too early and lose your intensity.
In the days leading up to the event, concentrate on hydrating, maintaining your diet and any supplements you’re using, and continuing to train as hard as you can. Three or four days before the event, pull back a bit on your WODs and concentrate on cardio during your off time. This will give your body a chance to rejuvenate so you can start the competition at peak performance levels.
At the Event
Many first time competitors make three mistakes – they dress wrong, they eat wrong, and they forget to warm up and cool down.
When it comes to dress, use the same clothing you do your WODs in. Don’t try to show off or buy a new outfit just for the event, you’re going to want something functional and familiar.
With all the adrenaline pumping through your system, it’s easy to forget to eat. Your body needs fuel, so set up a series of reminders to tell you when to eat, and don’t skip any meals during the event.
Warming up and cooling down between sessions is critical! Improper warmups increase the chance of injury, and improper cooldowns will overheat you and drain your stamina. Keep your FlexFit mat within reach during the event so you can warmup or cooldown at will.
After the Event
After the event, make sure to keep a record of all your times on all the sessions you participated in. Many first time competitors surprise themselves with how well they do, and you can track your improvements against this record in the months to come. During successive events, try to keep similar records of events you take part in so you can watch your scores improve over time!",credible
2727,Rebel Wilson: Bauer Media to fight record defamation payout,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Rebel Wilson won her defamation case against Bauer Media in June
A magazine publisher will appeal against a A$4.5m (£2.7m; $3.6m) defamation payout awarded to Hollywood actress Rebel Wilson.
Wilson was awarded the damages by an Australian court last month after arguing that she had been wrongly portrayed as a liar in several articles.
The sum was a record for a defamation case in Australia.
On Monday, publisher Bauer Media said it would lodge an appeal.
""It's important for us to revisit this unprecedented decision on the quantum of damages, which also has broad implications for the media industry,"" a lawyer for the group, Adrian Goss, said in a statement.
Bauer Media argued during the case that the articles were not defamatory, but the appeal announced on Monday contests only the payout's size.
In June, a jury ruled the eight articles had harmed the Australian actress's career in Hollywood, where she has appeared in films such as Bridesmaids and Pitch Perfect.
Wilson sought A$7m during the trial but had offered to settle for A$200,000 before taking the case to court.
In ordering the payout in September, Justice John Dixon said the defamation case had been ""unprecedented in this country"" because of its international reach.
""Ms Wilson's reputation as an actress of integrity was wrongly damaged in a manner that affected her marketability in a huge worldwide audience,"" he said.",fake
704,Betting on CS GO With Bitcoin,"Betting on CS GO With Bitcoin
(Before It's News)
Betting on CS GO with Bitcoin
Online gambling can go two ways: it can either be extremely safe or become very risky. It all depends on the laws of the country or state that you reside in. Some countries don’t care about where you’re putting your money while others may just throw you in jail simply because you bet a penny on a Counter Strike GO match.
Take, for instance, the United States. Since gambling is outlawed, most people might prefer turning to the privacy offered by Bitcoin rather than going for traditional currency.
What Is Bitcoin?
Bitcoin is basically money that you buy with money. Since it works pretty much as if you just bought something online from whatever website, how you use the product should be of no concern to anyone. As a result, you could use the bitcoins for esports Bitcoin betting.
However, it’s still tricky. Law enforcement learned this trick and is sometimes “stalking” for Bitcoin users as well. Traditional or online, bitcoins are still coins – and therefore, it’s still considered money. As a result, you may sometimes have to download the betting software to evade any prying eyes.
Why Go for Bitcoins When Playing CS GO?
There are many advantages to using Bitcoin in eSport betting. A Bitcoin gaming website, for instance, is much faster. When you use traditional currencies, most of the time you’d have to wreck your nerves to make the payment official. Introduce your details, get your acceptance, make your transaction, ensure that it’s legal; this may be just enough to make you lose interest in the betting session and miss the match in the meantime.
With bitcoin, however, you will only have to sign up using your email address. You will rarely find any other transaction processing fees, which means that the whole ordeal will be done rather quickly.
Furthermore, if it’s not legal in your country – you can make it legal. The wonderful thing about the Internet is the fact that it spreads worldwide – and that includes countries where online gambling is not considered an issue.
As a result, you may be a US player struggling with the laws of your state – but you could still be accepted on an outer website that allows players from the US. Since the website is not based on US grounds, you may not be bound by the law.
Here’s the kicker: if you used the traditional money, making the transaction would be all the more troublesome – you’d either have to make the conversion or hide from the law enforcement the fact that you’re betting on a game using your bank account. With bitcoin, however, most problems are done with. Bitcoins represent universal gaming currency – so regardless of the country, you won’t have to go through many struggles. It’s the same money, but less of a headache.
Winning CS GO Skins
Why do we bet during our Counter Strike GO game plays? It’s quite simple. We never really bet because we want to cash in the money and use it in real life; we bet because we want to use that money in the virtual world. We want to buy the skins and weapons necessary to win the tournaments that CS GO launches from time to time.
Well, some betting websites want to make things even simpler for us. Instead of playing for money, you are playing for skins. They may only look fashionable and fancy, but they are great help when it comes to protecting your hero in a CS GO gameplay.
These skins are also valuable in the real world. You can trade them for all you want – cash or bitcoins. The choice of how you use the winnings is pretty much yours. We bet on CS GO because we want to be the winners – so no matter if you use the prize to pimp your hero or pay your bread, you have all the freedom. eSport betting is convenient this way.
We are all gamblers – at least to some extent. If we don’t take the risk, we don’t win. Even when your take your hero in CS GO to some dark tavern, you take a risk – you have no idea who might creep up on you and end your game.
When you are betting with Bitcoin, there’s still some risk – but the focus is on the risk of losing the bet rather than the risk of getting caught and thrown in jail. It’s a method that is supposed to make your gaming experience a little more enjoyable – and less stressful. It will be lucrative and entertaining at the same time and, if you are lucky, it will also be rewarding. Give CS GO betting a try and may the odds be forever in your favor!",credible
3343,"Battered by the Dodgers, Diamondbacks Turn to Plan Z - Zack Greinke","That Greinke stands in the Dodgers’ path to a second straight appearance in the National League championship series is a story line with a nice Hollywood twist. The last time Greinke appeared in the postseason, he was a Dodger, losing in Game 5 of a 2015 division series against the Mets. Six of his teammates in that game also graced the Los Angeles starting lineup in the first two games of this series.
After the 2015 season, Greinke, who won the American League Cy Young Award in 2009, opted out of the final three years of his Dodgers contract to sign with the Diamondbacks. He was lured to Arizona by a six-year, $206.5 million deal — which is one of the most lucrative in baseball and also has the highest annual value of any contract in the sport.
In dashing toward that canopy of cash, Greinke, intentionally or not, was also moving away from the human sun shade that is Clayton Kershaw. As teammates they were good friends, but Greinke was always going to be known as the other Cy Young winner in that rotation.
In 2006, Greinke had considered retiring from baseball after he was found to have social anxiety disorder and depression. He didn’t retire, a lot of success followed — including four All-Star Game appearances — and now in the Valley of the Sun he has added to his accomplishments, although without the glare of Los Angeles (consider that three of his home wins this season, including one on Aug. 31 against the Dodgers, were in front of crowds of fewer than 20,000).
Photo
The local fans didn’t turn Greinke into a public piñata in 2016 when a torn left oblique muscle limited him to 26 games, even though as Greinke went, so went the Diamondbacks. They finished with 93 losses that season, a pretty poor initial return on the franchise’s $34-million-a-year investment in their ace.
This year, a healthy Greinke went 17-7 with a 3.20 E.R.A., and the Diamondbacks flipped their 2016 record, winning 93 games.
Against the Dodgers, Greinke was 1-2 this season with a 3.65 earned run average. But in his last two starts against his former team, he was credited with the win after pitching six innings in an 8-1 victory, and then he absorbed a no-decision during a seven-inning outing in an eventual 3-1 Arizona victory.

This is Greinke’s fifth division series, and he also has been in the N.L.C.S. twice. All of that experience could act as a calming influence on teammates like Jimmie Sherfy, who allowed three runs without recording an out on Saturday, or Ketel Marte, who made a fielding error that led to an unearned run.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
The Diamondbacks’ lineup has provided little support as well, stranding too many base runners and lacking any hitters as footloose and fret-free as the Dodgers’ tongue-flapping, bat-flipping Yasiel Puig.
Like Roger Federer when he is serving, Greinke has a delivery that does not telegraph the type or location of his pitches, which is why he is one of the best at baiting hitters into swinging at balls outside the strike zone. On Monday he will go up against a disciplined Dodger team that is collectively disinclined to chase pitches outside the strike zone. Something will have to give.
At the start of the season, Greinke’s meticulous preparation earned him the nickname Casper, because, as his teammates explained to Fox Sports Arizona’s Diamondbacks broadcasting crew, he is prone to disappearing into some back room to study opponents’ hitting tendencies.
On Saturday, Greinke declined to talk about his upcoming start. He said he would save all questions for his scheduled news conference during the Diamondbacks’ practice on Sunday in Phoenix. But before his wild-card start, he explained his approach to must-win games.
“I just focus on what you do getting ready and do your normal scouting report and just try to make good pitches,” he said. “And hopefully, the results work out good, but you can’t guarantee that.”
No, but he will be on the mound in Game 3, trying to invigorate this series before it is too late.",fake

REUTERS/Mike Theiler
BEIJING (Reuters) - China said on Monday it hopes the Iran nuclear deal will stay intact, playing an important role in keeping the peace, after a senior U.S. official said President Donald Trump is expected to decertify the agreement.
The official, speaking last week on condition of anonymity, said Trump was also expected to roll out a broader U.S. strategy on Iran that would be more confrontational. The Trump administration has frequently criticized Iran’s conduct in the Middle East.
Trump, who has called the pact an “embarrassment” and “the worst deal ever negotiated”, has been weighing whether it serves U.S. security interests as he faces an Oct. 15 deadline for certifying that Iran is complying with its terms.
Speaking in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said the Iran nuclear deal was a good example of how to solve something peacefully through talks.
The agreement had played a positive and important role in ensuring nuclear non-proliferation and protecting peace and stability in the Middle East, she added.
“We hope that the comprehensive Iran nuclear agreement can continue to be earnestly implemented,” Hua told a daily news briefing.
Iranian authorities have repeatedly said Tehran would not be the first to violate the accord, under which Iran agreed to restrict its nuclear program in return for the lifting of most international sanctions that had crippled its economy.
If Trump declines to certify Iran’s compliance, U.S. congressional leaders would have 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions on Tehran suspended under the agreement.
The prospect that Washington could renege on the pact, which was signed by the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Russia, China, the European Union and Iran, has worried some U.S. allies.
China has close economic and diplomatic ties with Tehran, and was also instrumental in pushing through the landmark 2015 deal.",fake
3512,U.S. still seeking explanation for arrest of staff in Turkey: ambassador,"U.S. Ambassador to Turkey John Bass speaks during a meeting with media members in Ankara, Tukey, October 11, 2017. REUTERS/Stringer
ANKARA (Reuters) - The United States is still seeking an explanation from Ankara for the detention of staff at U.S. missions in Turkey which led Washington to stop issuing visas and triggered a diplomatic crisis, the U.S. ambassador said on Wednesday.
Ambassador John Bass said the decision to suspend granting visas was not taken lightly, but the detentions indicated a breakdown in communication between the two NATO allies, whose relations have come under increasing strain.
“Unfortunately... the U.S. government still has not received any official communications from the Turkish government about the reasons why our local employees have been detained or arrested,” he told reporters at the U.S. embassy in Ankara.
Washington says two locally employed staff were arrested in Turkey this year. In May, a translator at the consulate in the southern province of Adana was arrested and last week a Drug Enforcement Administration worker was detained in Istanbul.
President Tayyip Erdogan’s spokesman said last week the Istanbul employee, Metin Topuz, had been in contact with a leading suspect in last year’s failed military coup. Turkish media reported similar accusations against the translator.
“The notion that people in our employment are facing or are under suspicion of terrorism charges here, that is a very serious allegation,” Bass said. “It is one we want to take seriously and we want to better understand the ostensible evidence that supports these allegations”.
Since the failed military coup in July last year, in which at least 240 people were killed, more than 50,000 people have been detained and 150,000, including teachers, academics, soldiers and journalists, have been suspended from work.
Some Western allies fear the crackdown shows the country is slipping ever deeper into authoritarian rule under Erdogan.
Ankara says its critics fail to understand the scale of the security challenges in Turkey, which has also faced conflict on its southern borders with Iraq and Syria, and an insurgency in its mainly Kurdish southeast.
U.S. Consulate is pictured in Istanbul, Turkey, October 11, 2017. REUTERS/Murad Sezer
ENVOY TARGETED
Erdogan has blamed Bass for the latest dispute, suggesting he acted unilaterally in suspending visa services and declaring that his government no longer considered Bass to be Washington’s envoy and would not hold meetings with him.
The U.S. State Department denied Bass acted alone, saying his actions were coordinated with officials in Washington.
In a sign that Ankara was stepping back from the pledge to exclude Bass, Turkish television channels reported that he met a foreign ministry official later on Wednesday. The ambassador is due to leave Turkey within days to take up a post in Afghanistan.
U.S.-Turkish tensions have risen in recent months over U.S. military support for Kurdish YPG fighters in Syria, considered by Ankara to be an extension of the banned PKK which has waged an insurgency for three decades in southeast Turkey.
Turkey has also pressed, so far in vain, for the United States to extradite Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, a former ally of Erdogan who is viewed in Ankara as the mastermind behind the failed coup.
Another source of friction was the U.S. indictment of Turkey’s former economy minister Zafer Caglayan for conspiring to violate U.S. sanctions on Iran. A U.S. court also indicted 15 of Erdogan’s guards after they clashed with protesters during his visit to Washington in May.
In addition to the two detained consulate workers, Turkey is holding a U.S. pastor on charges which Turkish media say include membership of Gulen’s network. Bass called for the release of the Christian missionary, Andrew Brunson, saying he had seen nothing of merit in the charges against him.
He denied reports that Turkish police were trying to speak to another consulate employee. “To the best of our knowledge there are not any outstanding requests from Turkish law enforcement officials for any of our local staff to come in and talk to them,” he said.",fake

Roy Moore is holding a campaign rally Monday evening and the “Faith & Family Rally” will feature several special guests.
Duck Dynasty’s Phil Robertson and former White House advisor Steve Bannon have both endorsed Moore for U.S. Senate and will address Roy’s supporters during the rally that begins at 7:00 pm CDT in Fairhope, Alabama.
President Donald Trump is backing Moore’s adversary, Sen. Luther Strange, likely because Strange offered his vote on the Graham-Cassidy Healthcare Bill which is now on its deathbed. But, the president did say that he would back Moore should he win the primary run-off.
The Trump-Bannon head-to-head endorsements have many implications for the 2018 mid-term elections. The Republican establishment fears that a Moore win would ignite an anti-establishment, anti-incumbent wildfire leading to a slew of primary challenges against GOP candidates. If Moore wins, it would also call into question Trump’s ability to rally support for establishment candidates.
Trump held a “Make America Great Again Rally” in Huntsville, Alabama for Luther Strange on Saturday night. Polls taken after that event show Strange’s support slipping. A September 24 Trafalgar Group poll shows Moore up 16 points over Strange up from 8-10 points before the rally.
Moore is widely seen as a more Trump-like candidate while Strange represents the status quo in Washington to many Alabamian voters. We’ll see if Bannon and Robertson help Moore keep his momentum as voters go to the polls on Tuesday.

3925,Carles Puigdemont: The man who wants to break up Spain,"Image copyright AFP/Getty Images Image caption Catalonia's leader Carles Puigdemont says the region has won the right to break away from Spain
The drive for independence that delivered the banned 1 October referendum did not begin under his leadership. But such is his zeal for secession, that Catalonia's President Carles Puigdemont is prepared to risk its existing autonomy to achieve it.
In defiance of the law and Spain's constitution, he has pushed forward in the hope of international recognition.
It may well be a doomed journey in the eyes of Spain's allies in Brussels and Washington - but the meek-looking village baker's son from Girona is undaunted.
Spanish lessons
Born in Amer in 1962, he grew up under the dictatorship of Gen Francisco Franco and was taught in Spanish at a church-run boarding school, but spoke Catalan at home like others of his generation.
Joan Matamala, a few years his senior at the school, remembers the boy everyone got on with, even the older pupils.
Image caption Bookseller Joan Matamala went to school with Carles Puigdemont
Mr Matamala runs a bookshop, Les Voltes, that has been promoting Catalan language and culture in Girona for 50 years. The young Puigdemont did not come over as a natural leader at the time but he was someone you did not forget, he says.
As a young man, Puigdemont had a passion for his native tongue, going on to study Catalan philology at the local university and polishing colleagues' copy when he first found work in the city's newspapers.
Miquel Riera worked with him at the fiercely pro-independence paper now known as El Punt Avui, often late into the night.
Image caption Miquel Riera worked with Carles Puigdemont at the pro-independence newspaper now known as El Punt Avui
""Right from the start he was very interested in new technology and the internet,"" says Mr Riera. This may have fed Puigdemont's awareness of social media, which was crucial in promoting the referendum campaign.
""He's a man who makes friends easily,"" says Mr Riera, whose 25-year-old son, he says, was bruised on the chest by a police rifle butt at a polling station on Sunday.

Mr Puigdemont served as mayor of Girona from 2011 until 2016 when he was elected regional president of Catalonia.
There is no denying his star appeal among his supporters, who clamour to take selfies with him at rallies.
His popularity cuts across class, coming as he does from comparatively modest origins, outside the Catalan elite which dominated the local centre-right alliance, Convergence and Union (now known as the Catalan European Democratic Party), for years.
""Puigdemont has been absolutely key to bringing Catalonia to where we are now,"" says Montse Daban, international chairperson of the Catalan National Assembly, a grassroots pro-independence movement.
""He's been an absolute and positive surprise for Catalan citizens, who were already supporting the independence process and saw with dismay that it was facing several burdens.""
Image caption The Catalan protests lead Catalan papers (above) but not Spanish ones
But his actions have brought him into conflict with Spanish law. And in the eyes of Spain's government, the Catalan leader has ruthlessly created a crisis, burning all the bridges in order to make a unilateral declaration of independence.
""Democracy is not about voting - there are referenda in dictatorships too,"" a Madrid government source told the BBC. ""Only when you vote with guarantees according to the law is it a democracy.""
The images of violence at the polling stations were ""150% part of Puigdemont's plan"", the source said.
""It's unfortunate because it was a trap. There's no doubt it looks bad for the Spanish government.""
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Thousands protested in Barcelona after the 1 October referendum was marred by violence
Mr Puigdemont talks the language of independence in a way his more cautious predecessor, Artur Mas, did not during the dry run referendum of 2014, which was also banned by Madrid.
Speaking to the BBC following Sunday's violence, Mr Puigdemont said: ""I think we've won the right to be heard, but what I find harder to understand is this indifference - or absolute lack of interest - in understanding what is happening here. They've never wanted to listen to us.
""How can we explain to the world that Europe is a paradise of democracy if we hit old women and people who've done nothing wrong? This is not acceptable. We haven't seen such a disproportionate and brutal use of force since the death of the dictator Franco.""
He has called for mediation - something the Spanish government says is unacceptable.
A Madrid source dismissed the idea, telling the BBC it would be ""mediation between Spanish government and part of the Spanish state… mediation between law and someone who has no framework.
""Mediation about what?""
Rebellion
According to the same source, Mr Puigdemont is bypassing his own party in his zeal to declare independence, meeting grassroots pro-independence groups instead of conducting regional government business.
Would Mr Puigdemont risk a split at the top of the independence movement that could be fatal to the cause?
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Carles Puigdemont spoke to the BBC on Tuesday evening
Out on the streets, expectations have soared as the concepts of independence and democracy blur into one.
Some independence supporters seem to have lost all fear of the Spanish police as their sense of outrage over Sunday's violence grows.
A handwritten poster on a Girona shop front reads: ""Whoever sows rebellion reaps freedom. 1 October.""
""He may be Spain's most dangerous man, since he seems to be heading towards a unilateral declaration of independence,"" says Manuel Arias Maldonado, political science professor at Málaga University.
""A different question is whether he controls at all what happens in Catalonia right now.
""If this is a revolution - and it looks like one - his power is diminished since he cannot dictate events.""",fake

That is what the Catalans “have achieved with this referendum,” he added. “Somehow now the rest of Spain feels more united.”

(Before It's News)
After two long years with the Columbus Blue Jackets and John Tortorella, Brandon Saad is back at home with the Chicago Blackhawks. While Artemi Panarin had great chemistry with Patrick Kane, Saad is arguably more valuable to the Blackhawks. When Saad was traded away, Blackhawks fans and other hockey circles were quick to point out that he wouldn’t be as good with Columbus because he spent most of his time with Toews and Hossa on the first line. Saad answered his critics with two straight 53 point seasons, even surviving Tortorella’s nonsensical coaching methods. Tortorella would bench Saad or relegate him to the fourth line at times, Quenneville’s dog house isn’t even that bad! Saad is the complete hockey player package; skates hard and fast, defensively reliable, finishing scoring touch and hard to knock off the puck. With those tools, The Blackhawks needed to have Saad back in the fold to reignite Toews and anchor down the first line. With Hossa out of the lineup this year Saad is one of the few players that can fill that gap. I’m totally aware that Hossa can’t just be “replaced” Saad can still provide that same stability and presence. The Saad – Toews – Panik line can be a force to be reckoned with this season. Brandon Saad on Marian Hossa’s Influence:
” That guy [Hossa] means a lot to a lot of people. For me to come in as a young guy especially, he’s a guy I’ve looked up to. I think he plays the game the way I want to play the game.”
Stan Bowman ultimately brought Saad back because he’s cost controlled at $6 million a year over 4 years and only 24 years old. There was absolutely no way the Blackhawks could afford Panarin’s contract after 2 years when his asking price will likely be over $7 million. If the past two years and this year’s preseason is any indication, Saad is ready to have the best season of his career back at home with the Blackhawks and once again fans can KNEEL BEFORE SAAD.

2489,2017-18 Ashes: Aussies to watch,"(Before It's News)
The Ashes, arguably international cricket’s most vicious rivalry, rolls around once more in November. Although England emerged victorious (3-1) in the Australian series of 2010-11, the series of 2013-14 saw Australia enact vengeance in the most emphatic way possible – a 5-0 whitewash. Given the squad’s home ashes record, Australia would always be favourites against England. However, the home side have never been so widely backed to score a second consecutive home whitewash over England.
5-0 whitewash universally expected
To say that the two sides approach the series in contrasting mindsets would be an understatement, and this is reflected in current Ashes odds, which can be viewed by anyone who opts to click here . After losing 2-1 to South Africa last autumn, Australia have bounced back in very real terms, with perfect home test form prevalent after that disappointing showing against the Springboks. By contrast, England will travel to Australia in unusually low spirits, with Ben Stokes’ recent exclusion (on disciplinary grounds) from the visiting squad only serving to divide and disrupt.
England’s away form can only give the Australian squad even more encouragement, with the squad losing 4-1 to India in its last away test series. Some experts would assert that England’s only true hope is Joe Root, with most of the other expected first XI performing erratically of late. To the more ardent England fan, Alastair Cook is considered something of a talisman, but many believe that age is now catching up with him. Even at home, England have been susceptible to the occasional batting collapse, with the fourth test in the recent home series against the West Indies being a very damning case in hand.
Smith can be ‘captain fantastic’
As one of the chosen few to be an Ashes captain, Steve Smith will naturally be in the spotlight more than any other home player. Though his captaincy has seen mixed fortunes for Australia, if all forms of international cricket are taken into account, his personal statistics spell danger for England. As of June 2017, Smith had scored twelve centuries and averaged 73.27 per inning. Overcoming a humiliation at the hands of South Africa in 2016 was also a real test of character for Smith, with his captaincy then very much in the balance. 2017 has been a truer reflection of his abilities, and Smith also has a test win rate of exactly 50% as Australia’s captain.
NSW Trio to give England the ‘blues’
Much of the confidence in the home side stems from the range of efficient fast bowlers that Australia coach Darren Lehmann has at his disposal.
Pat Cummins, Josh Hazlewood and Mitchell Starc are the most prominent men in that respect. With the latter two being left-handed, Australia will have the luxury of a multi-dimensional approach to dismissing England’s top batsmen. The fact that the trio are teammates at the NSW Blues can only add further fuel to the arguments in favour of an Australian whitewash.
David Warner: 30 not out
Though now the wrong side of thirty, top order batsman David Warner has the experience and composure needed to fulfil the expectation of a whitewash. Though part of a side that completed a 4-1 ODI series defeat to India just days ago, it was Warner’s never-say-die attitude which yielded the century that enabled the touring Aussies to win and avoid a whitewash. As one of the most hard-hitting Australian batsmen in recent memory, those who simply crave entertainment will certainly be keeping one eye on Warner.
Looking ahead
Lehmann’s uncompromising Australia squad has the impetus, but stranger things have happened in international cricket. The 2017-18 Ashes series begins at The Gabba on 23 November.

2040,Uber suspends unlicensed service in Norway in change of tack,"(Reuters) - Uber said on Monday it would suspend its unlicensed service UberPOP in Oslo until Norway introduces new rules, as the U.S. ride-hailing app adopts a more conciliatory tone with national authorities.
The move follows a similar one-year suspension in Finland in July to allow a new taxi law to come into effect, however there is no set date for when UberPOP will be reintroduced in Norway.
The U.S. ride-hailing company has come under fierce pressure from traditional taxi drivers and regulators across Europe who accuse it of unfair competition and skirting traditional licensing rules.
UberPOP has already been suspended in several European capitals, including Paris and Brussels, and Uber was recently humbled when it lost its license to operate in London.
“We’ve learned the hard way that we must change as a company in order to serve the millions of riders and drivers who rely on us. With our new CEO Dara Khosrowshahi onboard, it’s a new era for Uber,” the company said in a statement.
“That’s why it’s now time to pause UberPOP in Norway, in order to relaunch under new regulations.”
UberPOP will be suspended on Oct. 30, while Uber’s licensed services UberBLACK and UberXXL will continue to operate as normal.
The Uber logo is seen on mobile telephone in London, Britain, September 25, 2017. REUTERS/Hannah McKay
The Norwegian transport minister said Uber was being treated as any other market participant would be. “All actors offering taxi services must conform to rules and regulation at any time,” Ketil Solvik-Olsen told Reuters.
The suspension of UberPOP in Norway comes as the non-EU country must answer by Oct. 27 a query on its transport regulations by the EFTA Surveillance Authority (ESA), the body that ensures EU regulations are enforced in countries that have access to the European common market.
Uber will suspend UberPOP three days after that deadline.
In February, ESA said Norway was setting “disproportionately high barriers to enter the taxi market” that led to inefficient use of resources and higher prices for consumers.
Khosrowshahi took the helm of Uber in August, replacing co-founder and former boss Travis Kalanick and has promised change at the $70 billion dollar firm.
The company said it was encouraged by developments in Norway such as the government’s sharing economy committee which recommended repealing certain provisions related to taxis and an opinion from the EFTA surveillance authority which said Norway’s restrictions on taxi licenses were illegal.
“Norway deserves modernized laws that encourage innovation and competition without sacrificing what makes the Norwegian model special,” Uber said. “We hope the government will implement these recommendations soon, so that we can relaunch a new and improved version of the product loved by so many.”
UberPOP had around 280,000 users in Oslo and hundreds of drivers.

834,"Man Finds Note In SF Airport, You Won’t Believe What Was Inside","Man Finds Note In SF Airport, You Won’t Believe What Was Inside. There are times when people just need to reach out and tell their story, and leave it in the hands of fate. A man in a San Francisco airport stumbled upon a note which, on the outside in large letters, said “READ ME. What he found in the contents of the envelope left him emotional.
 
THE FULL TEXT READS: I recently left an emotionally abusive relationship. After months of insults I won’t repeat, false accusations, lies, delusions, broken mirrors, nightly battles. I left. I know that I was being poisoned by each day that I stayed. So with a heavy heart, I left my lover of three years, knowing that I had already put it off too long. At first he begged, then he cursed, but eventually he packed his bags and faded out of my life like a bad dream. 
 
For the first few weeks, my body seemed to reject this. For three years I had seen the world through him-colored glasses. I did not know who I was without him. Despite the kindness of friends and even strangers. I could not help feeling utterly alone. But it was this sense of aloneness that set me free. 
 
Somewhere along the way, I let go. I released all of the painful memories, the names he had called me, the shards of him buried deep in my brain. I stopped believing the things he had me think about myself. I began to see how extraordinary, breathtakingly beautiful life is. I meditated, drink too much coffee, talked to strangers, laughed at everything. I wrote poetry and stopped to smell and photograph every flower. Once I discovered that my happiness depends only on myself, nothing could hurt me anymore. I have found and continue to find peace. Each day I am closer to it than I was yesterday. I am a work in progress but I am full to the brim with gratitude and joy. 
 
And so, since I have opened a new chapter in my life, I want to peacefully part with the contents of the last chapter. The end of my relationship was the catalyst for a wealth of positive changes in my life. It was a symbol, most importantly, it was an act of self-love. It was a realization that I deserved to be happy and I could choose to be. And so, in an effort to leave behind the things that do not help me grow, I am letting go of a relic from the painful past. I wore this necklace, a gift from him, every day for over two years. To me, letting it go is a joyous declaration that I am moving forward with strength and grace and deep, lasting peace. 
 
Please accept this gift as a reminder that we all deserve happiness. Whoever you are, and whatever pain you have faced, I hope you find peace. Namaste, Jamie
 
Some know all too well that it is very difficult to leave a troubled relationship. And for those who have found the strength, they can relate deeply to what Jamie described in her letter.
 
Please share this with your friends who may be experiencing this heartache. Life is what you make it, and there is always hope.

2975,Nobel awarded for pioneering work to visualize biomolecules,"(CNN) The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2017 has been awarded to three scientists for their pioneering work developing new methods of visualising biomolecules, such as those in the Zika virus.
Jacques Dubochet of Switzerland, Joachim Frank of the US and Richard Henderson of the UK were awarded the prize for cryo-electron microsopy.
The technique allows scientists to freeze biomolecules in action and ""visualise processes they have never previously seen,"" according to the Nobel statement.
BREAKING NEWS The 2017 #NobelPrize in Chemistry is awarded to Jacques Dubochet, Joachim Frank & Richard Henderson. pic.twitter.com/RUZSnArJHO
The method means that, for example, molecules in bacteria and viruses -- such as the Zika virus -- can be examined under a microscope in their native, undamaged state.
This development is ""decisive for both the basic understanding of life's chemistry"" and the development of drugs, the Nobel committee said.
The announcement was made Wednesday in Stockholm.
""We are facing a revolution in biochemistry,"" said Nobel Committee Chairman Sara Snogerup Linse during the announcement. ""Now we can see the intricate details of the biomolecules in every corner of our cells, in every drop of our body fluids. We can understand how they are built and how they act and how they work together in large communities.""
""Soon there are no more secrets,"" she said.
'Immense' practical use
Until now, scientists have been unable to produce detailed images of many biological molecules that are the building blocks of life.
Previous techniques often required the use of dyes or fixatives to help see these molecules. In the past, electron microscopes were also assumed to be useful only in imaging dead material due to electron beams destroying biological matter.
Now, with the development of cryo-electron microscopy, researchers can freeze biomolecules mid-movement and observe how they act -- and interact.
Speaking at the conference by telephone, Frank said that the development of cryo-electron microscopy ""fills an important gap and extends the range of molecules that can be determined at atomic resolution.""
The final technical hurdle was overcome in 2013, when a new type of electron detector came into use. pic.twitter.com/Ue9c0R6v7y — The Nobel Prize (@NobelPrize) October 4, 2017
He described the practical uses of the technique as ""immense"" but said that it would take several years before the implications would be fully understood.
Frank was born in Germany in 1940 and is now a professor at Columbia University in New York.
His Swiss colleague Dubochet was born in 1942 and is honorary professor of biophysics at the University of Lausanne in Switzerland.
The third recipient, Richard Henderson, was born in Scotland in 1945 and works at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, England.
Initial reactions from the academic community of chemists have been positive.
John Hardy, professor of neuroscience at University College London, described the development of cryo-electron microscopy as ""transformative.""
""To give one example, last year the 3D structure of the enzyme producing the amyloid (protein) of Alzheimer's disease was published using this technology,"" Hardy said. ""Knowing this structure opens up the possibility of rational drug design in this area.""
""A visual image is the essential component to understanding,"" said Magdalena Zernicka-Goetz, professor of mammalian development and stem-cell biology at the University of Cambridge. Such an image is often the first thing to ""open our eyes, and so our minds, to a scientific breakthrough.""
The prize comes with an award of 9 million Swedish kronor ($1.1 million), shared when there are multiple recipients.
Previous winners include Marie Curie, known for her pioneering work on radioactivity, and Mario J. Molina, the first person to discover the damaging effect of CFC gases (found in refrigerators and spray cans) on the ozone layer.
Chemistry was the second prize mentioned in Alfred Nobel's 1895 will and was the most important of the sciences for his own work, according to the official website of the Nobel Prize.",fake

3619,Australia 2-1 Syria AET,"Media playback is not supported on this device Syria's 2018 World Cup dream ended by Australia
Syria's unlikely 2018 World Cup dream is over after Tim Cahill's extra-time header saw Australia progress 3-2 on aggregate to the final qualifying tie.
Omar Al Somah gave the civil war-torn nation hope of reaching Russia when he gave them an early lead in Sydney.
But Cahill, 37, quickly equalised with the first of his two headed goals.
Syria, who drew 1-1 in the first leg, were reduced to 10 men when Mahmoud Al Mawas was sent off before Cahill nodded in Robbie Kruse's cross for the winner.
Australia will now play Honduras from the Concacaf section for a place in the finals.
Cahill's 50th goal for his country sealed Australia's progress to the final round of World Cup qualifying
Syria were given real hope of reaching their first World Cup finals when a loose Mark Milligan pass let Al Somah charge through to score a sixth-minute opener with a low left-footed shot.
But Hertha Berlin winger Mathew Leckie engineered parity for the hosts when he provided the perfect cross for former Everton midfielder Cahill's first on 13 minutes.
The introduction of Huddersfield Town midfielder Aaron Mooy from the bench was then pivotal.
Australia manager Ange Postecoglou surprisingly left the 27-year-old out of his starting line-up, but the home side were instantly improved by his presence.
Indeed it was only Syria goalkeeper Ibrahim Almeh's heroics that denied Celtic's Tom Rogic and Leckie from sealing Australia's progress in the second half.
Syria defended resolutely and admirably got to extra time, but their task became harder when Al Mawas saw red for a second booking for bringing down Kruse.
With penalties looming, Cahill produced a trademark last-gasp header to score his 50th goal for Australia - more than any other player for the country.
Yet despite being a man down, the visitors almost snatched an equaliser to take the tie to penalties when Al Somah's free-kick hit the post in the 121st minute.
Omar Al Somah also scored Syria's goal in the first-leg draw in Malaysia
'Our disappointment is very big'
Syria coach Ayman al-Hakim: ""The first goal was a small mistake, not a major mistake, and the second goal was because we had 10 players.
""We studied the Socceroos very well and I think if we had stayed at 11 players and hadn't had that red card and hit the [post] at the end [it would have been different].
""But I am very proud of my boys with what they have achieved so far, and that's going to be continuing moving forward as well.""
Forward Firas Al Khatib: ""We were hoping to provide a smile and joy to Syrians everywhere. Our disappointment is very big.""
'We keep working until we can't anymore'
Tim Cahill became the 59th player in history to score 50 international goals
Socceroos midfielder Mark Milligan: ""Timmy [Cahill] worked outstandingly. That is something we have in us. We work until we cannot anymore.
""It was a loose pass [before Syria's goal]. I could have hit it a bit harder but they punished us with the quality in their striker.
""The longer the game went on, we had a good stranglehold on it. They fought with everything, they were outstanding and gave us an extremely tough match on our home soil.
""The next round will be a different match, we will have a different challenge on our hands.""
Analysis: That they were in contention was remarkable
Syria fans made their presence felt in the ANZ Stadium in Sydney
BBC Radio 5 live sports news correspondent Richard Conway:
""We went over to Syria for BBC Sport earlier in the year and spent six days in Damascus and discovered a truly remarkable story.
""Syria is in the middle of a six-year war and the team have no money because of the sanctions. Lots of Syrians have mixed emotions about supporting the team. Some, but by no means all, feel that the team rises above politics.
""The fact they were in contention for the World Cup was remarkable given what is stacked against them. They have a remarkable team spirit.
""They played their home games in Malaysia, which is a 14,000-mile round trip, and where they played the home leg of their play-off match against Australia.""
Fans turn out in Syrian cities
There were huge crowds in Syria's cities to follow the national team's fortunes
Syrian state TV broadcasting was dominated by coverage of the country's match against Australia.
It aired special programming, with live footage of huge crowds in Damascus's Umayyad Square, Aleppo, Homs and Sweida.

SAN FRANCISCO — Paul S. Otellini, who as chief executive expanded Intel’s already commanding chip-making business but failed to build a company franchise in mobile phones, died on Monday at his family’s second home in Sonoma County, Calif. He was 66.
The company, in Santa Clara, Calif., said he died in his sleep, but it did not specify a cause.
Mr. Otellini led Intel from 2005 to 2013 and was the first leader of that Silicon Valley giant who was not trained as an engineer. He rose mainly through Intel’s sales and marketing ranks after joining the company in 1974, but he held other positions as well, including chief of staff for Andrew S. Grove, the longtime chairman and chief executive who was credited with turning Intel into the dominant supplier of microprocessor chips for personal computers. Mr. Grove died in 2016.
Where Mr. Grove and his immediate predecessor, Craig R. Barrett, were tough taskmasters, Mr. Otellini was known for a softer, more personable touch. “He solved problems without yelling like some of his predecessors,” Mr. Barrett wrote in an email. “Probably the best decision I made as C.E.O. was to recommend him as my replacement.”
Through the 1980s and ’90s, Intel solidified its position in personal computers as advances in manufacturing produced chips that ran software faster. But Mr. Otellini faced a series of challenges when he became chief executive in May 2005.

At the time, Intel’s chips consumed too much power and generated too much heat.

The men, a Canadian citizen, a U.S. citizen living in Pakistan, and a citizen of the Philippines, planned to shoot concert goers, detonate a bomb in New York City’s Time Square, and attack the city’s subway system. The parallels to the Paris nightclub attack at the Bataclan, which included grenade attacks on nearby venues, is clear.

1986,"Iran hardliners, pragmatists show unity in response to Trump","LONDON (Reuters) - A tough line from President Donald Trump has been met by a show of unity from both sides of Iran’s political divide, uniting hardliners who cast the United States as an implacable enemy with pragmatists who seek rapprochement with the West.
Iran, which has kept up a steady drumbeat of angry statements for days, lashed out again on Tuesday, threatening to teach the Americans “new lessons” and keep “all options on the table” if Washington blacklists its Revolutionary Guards.
Trump, who has accused his predecessor Barack Obama of being too soft on Iran, is expected to announce a hardening of policy this week, likely to include “decertifying” a landmark 2015 deal that lifted international sanctions in return for curbs on Tehran’s nuclear programme. Such a step would stop short of pulling out of the agreement, leaving that decision to Congress.
Trump is also expected to designate Iran’s most powerful security force, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), as a terrorist organisation. The IRGC has a vast economic empire in Iran, and blacklisting it could make it more difficult for Iranian businesses to access the global financial system.
“It seems the Trump administration understands only swear words, and needs some shocks to understand the new meaning of power in the world,” said Iranian armed forces spokesman Masoud Jazayeri, who is also a Revolutionary Guards commander.
“The Americans have driven the world crazy by their behaviour. It is time to teach them a new lesson.”
Several Iranian newspapers ran the same photo on the front page on Tuesday: the urbane, U.S.-educated Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif laughing and hugging the commander of the IRGC, Major-General Mohammad Ali Jafari, in a striking display of unity between the two main factions of Iran’s leadership.
“We have a similar stance but different ways of saying it,” the papers quoted Jafari as saying.
Related Coverage UK reaffirms commitment to Iran nuclear deal in call with Trump: May's office
Iran’s moderate president Hassan Rouhani won re-election less than five months ago after a campaign in which he called for better ties with the outside world and reform at home, openly criticising the influence of the IRGC which he accused of backing his hardline opponent. But the moderates and hardliners tend to rally together in public when threatened from abroad.
“The Americans are too small to be able to harm the Revolutionary Guards,” Ali Akbar Velayati, the top adviser to Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, was quoted as saying by ISNA. “We have all options on the table. Whatever they do, we will take reciprocal measures.”
U.S. sanctions on the IRGC could affect conflicts in Iraq and Syria, where Tehran and Washington both support warring parties that oppose the Islamic State militant group (IS).
Russia, Iran’s ally that is also fighting IS in Iraq and Syria, said on Tuesday that it does not consider the Revolutionary Guards to be a terrorist organisation.

“FIRM, DECISIVE AND CRUSHING”
The Iranian nuclear deal, backed by European countries, China and Russia, lifted broad international sanctions over Iran’s nuclear programme that had been tightened during the Obama years and had caused severe damage to Iran’s economy.
But Washington still maintains separate unilateral sanctions over Tehran’s ballistic missile programme and over allegations that it supports terrorism. The lingering U.S. sanctions have slowed Iran’s re-emergence into the world economy, making global banks reluctant to take on business with Iranian firms despite the nuclear deal.
The United States already blacklists some individuals and entities for supporting IRGC activities, but not the Guards themselves. Designating the Guards as terrorists could make it more difficult for Iranian businesses to take advantage of the lifting of the international sanctions, since banks are required to verify that their clients are not on terrorism blacklists.

Iran’s rial has dropped against the U.S. dollar in recent days in a sign of concern about Trump’s policy. The rial was quoted in the free market around 40,400 to the dollar, currency exchangers in Tehran told Reuters, compared to 39,200 last week. Several exchangers said they had stopped selling dollars from Monday and were waiting to assess the trend in the market.
The government told Iranians on Tuesday it would not let the decisions of the “mentally unstable” Trump affect the market.
“Trump might say some things by the end of the week, but this should not create chaos in the market. Iran is a stable country, and nothing will happen,” government spokesman Mohammad Baqer Nobakht said in a weekly news conference.
Iran’s Central Bank governor, Valiollah Seif, was also quoted as saying by Tasnim news agency that “Trump’s words might have an emotional impact on the foreign exchange market, but it would not be long-term”.
Washington aims to put more pressure on the IRGC, especially over its missile programme. Trump said in September that recent IRGC missile tests illustrated the weakness of the nuclear deal.
Iran says the nuclear deal does not require it to restrict its missile programme.
Zarif, the Iranian foreign minister, said Iran purposefully excluded military capabilities from the pact, as “it is not intended as leverage or a bargaining chip in future negotiations”.
In an article published in the Atlantic magazine on Monday, Zarif added: “No party or country need fear our missiles ... unless it intends to attack our territory.”",fake

3484,False Flag in Vegas Shooting?,"By Jon Rappoport
False flags always target the psychological state of mind of the public. Mind control is the goal.
To boil it down, a false flag is an operation staged to blame someone for a crime, someone who didn’t commit the crime.
Why? Because by blaming that person or group, and by convincing many others to blame that person or group, you achieve an important objective.
Simplistic over-exaggerated version: “Last night, a homeless man was found shot dead in an alley. The gun was found next to his body. The Mayor’s fingerprints were on the [planted] gun. The Mayor was arrested at his office. The election nears. The Mayor’s opponent now appears to have a clear path to victory…”
Less simplistic version: “…the worst mass shooting in US history. Stephen Paddock, 64, has been named as the Las Vegas shooter. He is dead. He killed 58 people at a concert and wounded 515 others. In the Congress, calls are rising for new gun control laws…”
But, as it turns out, the evidence suggests there were multiple shooters in the Mandalay Hotel. Paddock may or may not have been one of them. The overall operation was designed to invoke widespread horror and fear, and usher in new restrictions on gun ownership…
The other possible shooters in the hotel would have been professionals, tasked with killing as many people as possible at the country music concert.
Gun control would not be the only agenda in this false flag.
Heavily militarized police all over this country would be another agenda.
Putting a significant dent in the economy would be another—if attendance at public events and in crowded public places diminishes.
Such a reduction in attendance could even affect political forums and other gatherings where free speech and the right to assemble are vital. (We’ve already seen significant disruptions of these events.)
Invoking fear and passivity in the population is another basic agenda. This leads to the attitude: “Let the authorities handle everything.”
We could see new, more outrageous violations of Constitutional search and seizure principles, all in the name of “the need for security.”
As in the aftermath of Sandy Hook, there may be new calls for psychiatric screening of the population, including young children, in order to “spot criminals before they commit crimes.” This is sheer madness, because no so-called mental disorder is based on any defining lab test, and many of the prescribed drugs (SSRI antidepressants) push people over the edge into committing violence. —More violence, more calls for psychiatric screening, more drugs, more violence: an escalating scenario and repeating cycle, leading to tighter Control from above.
When was the last time you saw a major false flag exposed by the mainstream press, and then admitted to by the actual perpetrators, who then explained their true objectives?
Never.
False flags are, over the long term, essential to maintaining and expanding the status quo: power is collected and increased at the top, and then exerted downward.
Note: All prior analyses I’ve made about the duration of the shooting, and numbers of people killed and injured, are subject to change. Why? Because as yet, we have no accurate reports on how many of the 515 people injured were actually shot versus trampled or hurt in some other fashion. Also, police reports that are emerging differ on the duration of the shooting. The NY Times is talking about roughly 7 minutes. Newsweek suggests the duration is longer.
Nevertheless, the background of the purported shooter, Stephen Paddock, gives no indication of any competence with auto weapons, gives no indication he could have dealt with the problems and challenges of using such a weapon—and on top of that, his state of mind at the time, as an non-professional, would have been unstable, to say the least.
Any reasonable law-enforcement group investigating this mass shooting would certainly keep its options open, regarding other perpetrators. But that is not what is happening here. The books are closed on this case. There is no going back.
The desired result has been achieved. One shooter, mass killings. End of story. Objective achieved.
That rush to judgment and “closure” is also a prime feature of the false flag. It has to be.

We said it here on BYB first and all of you hated me for it. We didn’t like the way Derek Jeter came into Marlins Park and fired 4 Marlin icons. And the worst part was, it wasn’t even him, it was him directing, David Samson, the outgoing President to do it. We found it spineless and crass.
We wrote DEREK JERK-ER, and we got heat for it because we verbally attacked you beloved Jeter. Well… We’re right, and even Jeter knows that now…
CBS Sports writes:
“…According to Jon Heyman of FanRag Sports and Barry Jackson of the Miami Herald, Jeter has reached out to the four franchise icons in an attempt to make amends. Conine, Dawson, and Perez have reportedly been offered jobs as well. From Heyman:
Jeter reached out to the four men Friday or over the weekend, explaining to them that he didn’t believe he could call them until the sale closed (it did so on Friday), and was now giving them a message that was much more positive, and in fact the opposite of what they heard previously.
The four men, who now could all be back with the team (depending on the role offered, of course), either declined comment or could not be reached. Jeter told them that he’d discuss their new roles at a later date.
Jackson describes Jeter as “doing damage control or rethinking the situation” after receiving bad publicity for the firings, not only because of the four men involved, but also because he didn’t fire them himself. Jeter had longtime team president David Samson, who himself is on the way out, do the firings.”
Photo: New York Daily News
It was a foolish move on Jeter’s part and Barry Jackson of the Herald is right, this is about Jeter’s image and legacy only. If no one said anything, Jeter would have continued to do whatever he wanted, but here’s the problem with that; the Marlins fans have nothing down there but a nice ballpark. Keeping those Marlins and Hall of Famers around is good for business… and they should be kept and built around.
Trust me, as an owner of the Marlins, there are hundreds of other things he could do to bring in revenue besides firing Marlins players and tying to remove the damn dolphin art display out in center field.
Give me a break…
Just wanted to keep you updated. Happy Monday.

(Before It's News)
The Key Strategic Move that Influenced the Outcome
You could argue the move that influenced the outcome was the lack of preparation across the entire coaching staff prior to setting foot in London, and not arriving there much earlier (but that’s another story that I’m sure my colleagues will touch on).
Tactically, this game largely comes down to evaluating Blake Bortles’ performance. Bortles wasn’t Bortles at all. Maybe he needed the support from the Jaguar fans across the pond. But really, maybe all he needed was to face Dean Pees’ defense.
Now, give a lot of credit to Jacksonville offensive coordinator Nathaniel Hackett, who devised a terrific game plan that kept the Baltimore defense on its heels early and often. The Jaguars ran pre-snap shifts and misdirection to get the Baltimore defenders out of position, he sprinkled in screens to expose the lack of open-field instincts of the linebackers, and most importantly, he gave Bortles easy completions on first down. He kept Bortles in a comfortable position.
But Pees’ passive and predictable game plan certainly made things comfortable, too. He once again relied on his straight four-man rush to apply pressure on Bortles, with a smattering of stunts and twists. It’s almost as if the second Brandon Carr gave up a long completion down the right sideline against Marqise Lee, Pees went into a shell with his play-calling and elected not to challenge Bortles with any combination of bluff or blitz action.
Jacksonville didn’t give up a sniff of pressure, let alone a sack. When Pees showed the blitz too early on a key 3rd-and-11 play, Bortles easily slid his protection to pick it up. The Weddle blitz in which Bortles was able to escape and buy time to extend the play was laughably executed. The blitz was declared way too early, and there was no deception as to where the blitz was coming from.
I understand the players didn’t execute either. Weddle deserves his share of blame for the play for tipping it too soon and not finishing the tackle. But where was all the pre-snap movement Pees showed in the preseason? At the minimum, he would have his defenders crowd the line, sometimes stressing the A gaps, sometimes stressing the edges with overload looks. He often brought his backers on cross blitzes and the corners were held responsible for locking things down in one-on-one coverage on the back end.
Considering the investment that’s been made in this secondary, it seemed logical that the rush would be freed up to take more chances. The defensive coaching staff talked about playing that style of defense. So far, it’s been a lot of hot air, and more of the same “hold on for dear life” defense we’ve seen year after year.
There’s nothing wrong with relying more on your front to win their individual matchups to apply pressure on the QB. But when they can’t get it done, you have to try something different. At least give more playing time to the one guy who was getting any pressure at all (Tim Williams) and stop dropping one of your most effective rushers (Matt Judon) into coverage.
To this point, the schemes have been just as tired as the rhetoric that this defense will be aggressive.
What Went Right
The only thing that went right was on the offensive side of the ball, and that had more to do with Alex Collins’ performance than anything else. Can’t really point to scheme as the positive here, he just ran hard and has shown the extra burst to turn the corner. The coaching staff needs to get him more opportunities on counters, traps, and sweep action.
What Went Wrong
There’s a laundry list, and the defense has been hit hard already. Let’s switch to the offense.
Offensive coordinator Marty Mornhinweg could learn something from Hackett and mix in more screens to give the offense better early-down efficiency. Or how about some run/pass option plays? I watched plenty of football on Sunday to drown out the awfulness of London, and the rest of the league is all over the run/pass option play (or as Tony Romo calls them, RPOs). Green Bay, Cincinnati, Pittsburgh, Washington. They all have those option plays built into their offense.
When the Ravens receivers face any level of off coverage, there has been no attempt by Joe Flacco to get them the ball quickly to let them make moves in space. Now, I know what you’re going to say – Jacksonville corners Jalen Ramsey and A.J. Bouye pressed the receivers all day so those plays wouldn’t have worked anyway. It’s a fair point.
But this has been an issue forever. And there is a way to use stacks and motion to free the receivers up. This is a static offense though that shows too many balanced looks.
The receivers aren’t given help to get a clean release.
The strength and talent of this offense is its three receivers. You must figure out a way for them to get the ball, whether it’s in space or downfield. Right now, the Ravens haven’t had anything resembling a downfield passing attack, and a lot of that blame goes to Flacco.
Defenses are sitting on their underneath routes, playing press, and daring the receivers to win, and this coaching staff isn’t doing anything to adjust.

316,Trump: Senate Intel Committee should investigate 'fake news',"President Donald Trump continued his attacks on the media today, suggesting in a tweet that the Senate Intelligence Committee should investigate news outlets for ""fake"" reporting.
Why Isn't the Senate Intel Committee looking into the Fake News Networks in OUR country to see why so much of our news is just made up-FAKE! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 5, 2017
Trump has been railing against the media this week for its coverage of his trip to Puerto Rico and his relationship with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.
Trump zeroed in on NBC News, which reported Wednesday morning that Tillerson was on the verge of resigning in July and had called Trump a ""moron.""
The secretary of state, issuing a rare statement, shot down the report: ""I have never considered leaving this post.""
While in Las Vegas Wednesday, Trump said that he has ""total confidence in Rex"" and called the story ""phony"" and ""made up."" NBC News is standing by its reporting.
According to NBC News, tensions between Trump and Tillerson reached a peak when Trump delivered a politicized speech in July to the Boy Scouts of America, an organization Tillerson formerly led.
""[Tillerson], from my perspective, is in an incredibly frustrating place where...he ends up not being supported in a way that I would hope a secretary of state would be supported,"" said Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and is an ally of Tillerson's. Corker also said Tillerson is one of ""those people that help separate our country from chaos.""
After Tillerson said the U.S. has open lines of communication with North Korea, Trump undermined Tillerson by tweeting that Tillerson is ""wasting his time"" trying to negotiate with ""Little Rocket Man"" Kim Jong Un.
""Save your energy Rex, we'll do what has to be done!"" Trump tweeted over the weekend.
The Senate Intelligence Committee, another frequent target of Trump's attacks on Twitter, is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election and any possible collusion with Trump campaign associates.
The committee's two top senators announced Wednesday that the ""issue of collusion"" between Russia and Trump campaign associates is still unresolved.",fake

3665,The Girl in the No. 8 Jersey,"Stacee’s family soon announced that she died. My wife and I didn’t really know Stacee much — obviously not well enough to notice that she was not among the few dozen people at a rec-level girls’ soccer game. But some of our closest friends were dear friends of hers, and our town is small enough that there was probably no more than two degrees of separation to the family.
My family was among the hundreds of people, friends and strangers, who crowded onto the grounds of an elementary school and held candles aloft during the vigil. My daughter was one of the dozens of kids who solemnly held roses in her honor, and she hugged her classmate and teammate when it ended. She and a couple of friends made a cake and delivered it to the Etchebers’ house the next day.
Orange was Stacee’s favorite color, and on Friday, after people bought as much orange ribbon as they could find at all the local craft stores, an army tied ribbons all around town, from the trees on downtown’s Grant Avenue to the posts in front of Pioneer Park. My wife and her friends tied them around the trees in front of the middle school where Stacee’s daughter goes to school, along with mine.

I missed it all. I was as close to the site of the shooting as you could get, and yet felt fully disconnected from the effect of the tragedy. One night I walked to the memorial that sprang up in the median of South Las Vegas Boulevard, the kind of now-familiar post-shooting memorial that I saw at Columbine almost two decades before, with balloons and flowers and candles. I found a photo of Stacee that had been placed in the middle of it all, and took a picture and sent it home.
In Las Vegas, Stacee was just one in a crowd, part of a list. But she and her family were all anyone talked or thought about back in Novato, and that is where I got my news. I heard that Stacee’s husband, a San Francisco police officer, was running with Stacee through the barrage of gunfire when he stopped to help someone; he told his wife to go on and never saw her alive again. I heard that television news trucks were parked in front of the house. I heard stories of friends pulling over in their cars to cry at the weight and nearness of it all. There were beautiful and crushingly sad Facebook posts in Stacee’s honor, the kind you see after every tragedy, except these were written by people I knew well.
I heard my wife, who grew up in a nearby town, tell me that she had never been more proud to call Novato home.
I checked out of that Mandalay Bay suite on Saturday morning, excused from reporting duties, and flew home in the hopes of making my daughter’s soccer game. I found the red rose from the vigil, starting to fade and wilt, in a vase on the kitchen counter. When we got to the game, we and the other parents were somewhat surprised to see Stacee’s husband and extended family there, too. Warming up with the girls was No. 8, with her long ponytail.
We all wore orange ribbons, attached by safety pins, including the girls on both teams. The Novato team wore orange armbands with the initials “S.E.” Before kickoff, both squads came across the field to the spectator side and lined up in straight lines. Our team’s coach asked the parents to stand for 30 seconds of silence. And then two of the league’s better teams played a rather meaningless soccer game, only this one felt about as meaningful as anything I’ve ever watched.
And it was late in the second half when the ball suddenly swung from one end to the other, and Stacee’s daughter gave chase through three retreating opponents and beat them all to the ball. And in one blink-and-you-missed-it moment, she booted the ball into the corner of the net for what held on as the winning goal.

(Before It's News)
by Ray Kuhn
The playoff picture is getting clearer as we saw two more teams, the Chicago Cubs and Minnesota Twins, celebrate last night. Hopefully that will be your fate as well come Sunday evening. Let’s take a look at some of the performances that stood out from a busy day in baseball:
1) Correa Leaves the Park, Twice…
When watching Carlos Correa close out the year, it is only natural to wonder what his numbers would have been if he didn’t miss almost two months of the season with a thumb injury. The good news though, is the shortstop is going out with a bang, and going into next season, he will only continue to improve. Against the Rangers on Wednesday, Correa picked up hits in four of his five at bats, while hitting home runs in consecutive at bats (which also came in consecutive innings). Correa finished a triple shy of the cycle, and in 412 at bats so far this season, he has 23 home runs and 81 RBI while batting .308. Since his return, Correa is hitting .264 in 22 games, but it was a good sign to see him go deep yesterday, as there is always a concern about the temporary loss of power following a hand injury.
2) Blackmon Reaches the Century Mark…
A lead-off hitter with 100 RBI, sign me up. But, when it comes to Charlie Blackmon, there is more. Not only does the outfielder hit for power, but he also runs. Now Blackmon isn’t running this season as much as he did in 2014 and 2015, but he did steal his 14th base of the season yesterday. All three of Blackmon’s hits yesterday were singles, but he did drive in three runs, and with 36 home runs this season, it is not like power is an issue. With a .328 batting average, the outfielder is poised to reach career highs in four of the five roto categories (he hit .324 last season). While there is, rightfully so, a great deal of focus placed on Blackmon’s power, we should also note that he has scored 136 runs so far this season which well surpasses his mark of 111 from last year.
3) Marte Tries to Salvage His Season…
Getting suspended for half the season isn’t exactly ideal, but Starling Marte served his 80 game sentence. It wasn’t that simple though, as Marte didn’t exactly return and just pick up right where he left off. This season has been a struggle for the outfielder, as after two hits on Wednesday, he just brought his average up to .268. Compared to his career BABIP of .353, this year’s mark of .313 helps to explain the drop in batting average, but there also has to be some rust in his .250 July and .265 August batting averages. The good news though, is that Marte turned it around to hit .306 so far this month, and his stolen bases have not suffered. Yesterday, Marte stole his 20th base of the season, and he could be a good value pick next season if his ADP, even partly, reflects his 2017 statistics.
4) Severino is Ready…
For the playoffs that is. A clear ace has emerged in the Bronx this season, and that is Luis Severino. The right-hander made what likely will be his last regular season start last night, and he ended the regular season victorious. Severino picked up his 14th win of the season with six innings of one run ball as he scattered four hits and walked one. The right-hander struck out nine, and his ERA sits at 2.98 to close out the season. You have to like Severino’s 10.71 strikeouts per nine innings, but it is his FIP of 3.07 (3.05 xFIP) that really makes you feel good about him for next season.
5) Russell Makes His Hit Count…
2017 just never got going for Addison Russell. He struggled, had to deal with some drama, got hurt, and just never found his groove. Russell’s plight, other than what played out in the gossip pages, wasn’t unlike some of his teammates, but that is all behind the Cubs now, as once again, they are division winners. Russell came through last night as he hit a three run homer in the seventh inning as part of Chicago’s five run outburst. It was the 12th home run of the season for the shortstop who is hitting just .242 with 43 RBI in 347 at bats. Even last year, Russell didn’t hit for average, .238, but he did drive in 95 runs in 151 games. At just 23 years old, long term, I’m not worried about Russell, at least compared to last season’s performance. What will hold him back though, is if he doesn’t make any adjustments and his average is still below .250.
6) A Pinch Hit Home Run for Smith…
Since his promotion, we have seen good things and bad things from Dominic Smith. This past month or so has served, or was supposed to serve, as an audition for 2018, and the results have been mixed. There are plenty of flashes where we see why Smith was a first round pick, tore up Triple-A and is a top prospect, but he is also hitting .204. Last night, he came off the bench to hit a three run homer which was his eighth of the season in 157 at bats. The fact that Smith has 46 strikeouts isn’t exactly working in his favor, but neither is a .231 BABIP. The Mets should bring in a veteran placeholder to at least platoon with Smith next season, but at the same time, he has done all he can in the minor leagues.
7) Bogaerts Moves up to Lead-off…
With Mookie Betts day-to-day, the move is temporary, but batting atop the order seemed to agree with Xander Bogaerts yesterday. In what has been a rough year for the shortstop, he went 3 for 5 with four RBI and two runs scored as he brought his average up to .272. After hitting 21 home runs and driving in 89 runs last year, it was the just the 10th home run of the season for Bogaerts who is up to 61 RBI on the season. When trying to look for reasons why Bogaerts performance dipped, there isn’t all that much that jumps out. His home run to fly ball rate did drop from 11.4% to 7.4%, and I would venture to guess that this year’s number is more realistic to expect than last year’s. The shortstop also traded about four percent of fly balls for ground balls while seeing his ISO drop from .152 to .129. I’m not jumping ship here, but I would be careful with Bogaerts for next season.
8) Bailey Finishes the Season Strong…
For Homer Bailey, it’s a big deal that he is healthy to close out the season. It is even better that he did so with seven shutout innings in Milwaukee where he allowed four hits and three walks while striking out four. What disconcerting though, is that his ERA currently sits at 6.43 for the season after 18 starts. Going through an off-season while not rehabbing should benefit Bailey, and just going by his FIP of 4.90, he is due for some serious regression. With a 4.42 career ERA, we shouldn’t go too crazy with Bailey, but he still can be a reliable back end of the rotation starter.
9) Delmonico Drives in Three…
With a two run homer in the 10th inning, Nicky Delmonico sent the Twins into the playoffs as the White Sox defeated the Angels. It was the 10th home run of the season for Delmonico who seemingly emerged from nowhere to bat in the middle of Chicago’s order for the second half of this season. Delmonico went 3 for 5 with three RBI (23 on the season) last night, as he brought his batting average up to .267 in 135 at bats. But what does this mean for next season? Over 1,800 at bats, the 25-year old is a career .257 hitter in the minor leagues, and prior to his promotion, he was hitting .262 with 12 home runs and 45 RBI in 99 games at Triple-A so far this season. The quick answer, is that Delmonico is nothing special, but he could have some AL-only value depending on what his role is for next season.
10) Hill Closes the Regular Season Out in Style…
Look at that, Rich Hill made it through the season without any major injury issues. Now, when looking at 2018, I wouldn’t bank on that again, but his owners this season certainly aren’t complaining. Hill picked up his 12th victory of the season with seven shutout innings against the Padres as he allowed just two hits and two walks. The southpaw struck out 12 as he lowered his ERA to 3.32 as he enters the playoffs on a positive note.

3423,What is the Perfect Golf Swing?,"What is the Perfect Golf Swing?
(Before It's News)
You may not realise it, but as far back as 2008, Scientists reckoned that they had found the ‘secret’ to achieving the perfect golf swing.
In a report from the Department of Mechanical, Medical and Aerospace Engineering based at the University of Surrey, Professor Robin Sharp and his team announced to the world that they felt that had unlocked the secrets of this key element of the game of golf.
Unfortunately for golfers across the world, his explanation of how to achieve the swing, quoted verbatim below, encapsulates the problems many golfers face when trying to improve their own game:
“Generating too much arm speed too soon causes an early release, with the club-head reaching maximum speed before it arrives at the ball.” “The optimal strategy consists of hitting first with the shoulders while holding back with arms and wrists and after some delay, hitting through with the arms.“ “At release, the timing of which depends on the combination of shoulder and arm actions employed, the wrists should hit through.“ “Control of the arms and not the wrists appears to be a priority.”
So now you know, or if you are like me, you are just more confused than you were before you read the article. How long should you ‘delay’ your arm and wrist movement before hitting through? A millisecond? Until near the end of the stroke?
It all sounds rather like the ‘tuition’ in this wonderful golf video:
This article serves to highlight the difficulty that comes with trying to improve your swing basing it on the modelling of another golfer, or as in this example, scientific theory. The essence of the problem being that you cannot translate the movements of another, or as suggested by a theory, easily into your own golf swing.
It is a dilemma that most golf professionals face on a daily basis when they are taking on keen new golfers eager to improve their game and reduce their handicap. The question every club pro has to ask themselves is how can they improve a players game and their swing, without bemusing them in the first place?
And it is not just club players who struggle with any changes made to their swing. Tiger Woods suffered for many months after well-documented changes to his swing within the past two years. Even now, while he has regained a semblence of his old form, it is telling to see just how many times Tiger elects to keep the driver in his bag to play a safer shot.
Contrast that with the swings of the likes of Bubba Watson or Jim Furyk, both who have distinctive swings that should, according to golf theory, not really produce consistent, effective results, but which have done, certainly in Furyk’s case, for many, many years.
It is interesting therefore to take note of how golf tuition is changing. In the past, players may have gone to a professional and be shown what the professional believed was the ‘correct’ way to hold the club, swing it and follow through. This golfing template didn’t really account for individual differences and often led to players seeing a diminishing return from their ‘improvement’ classes.
Nowadays though, it is different. Pro’s like Bran Banic, pro at Lavaux Golf Club in Lausanne, Switzerland, are changing the philosophy somewhat and focusing on enhancing the effectiveness of a players natural swing and grip, rather than making wholesale changes to it to try and achieve adherence to a theoretically perfect swing model.
This doesn’t mean that fundamental errors in swing, set up, grip etc are ignored, good golf tuition will allow the professional to help the player learn to eradicate these mistakes from their game without impinging greatly on their natural swing pattern and rhythm. So errors like these below, can be avoided!
The language golf pro’s now use to encourage pupils is also changing; rather than long, complex instructions that are so difficult to remember and can result in the complete breakdown of an otherwise workable golf swing, professionals will now give students just one or two key points to remember, encouraging them to swing easily through the ball.
In addition, by focusing on a simple, easy to remember teaching points, golfers can then see immediate improvement in their game. Indeed, our own Tommy Priest has been delighted with the results in his game after a single tip from Bran resulted in a tangible improvement on the course.
So, while experts may view Luke Donald, Rory McIlroy or any other golfer as having the perfect golf swing, the truth is they have the golf swing that is perfect for them and that with the help of a top golf professional and expert tuition, maybe you can get the golf swing that is perfect for you too.
And you won’t need a degree in aeronautics, physics and biomechanics to understand how to do it, either.

3894,"A Cryptic Note, Impossible Planted Rifle And Swipe Of A Key Card That Doesn't Add Up","By Aaron Kesel
There are holes galore over the official narrative of the Las Vegas shooting; even police are starting to admit that a single gunman could not have been responsible for the plot. It’s way too sophisticated, far too many people died and were injured, while the motive hasn’t been determined thus far. Too much doesn’t add up. It seems like every day we are given more questions than answers as evidence begins to drip out. Now a cryptic note with numbers has been disclosed by authorities.
It has almost been a week since one of the worst mass shootings in U.S. history but investigators, journalists, and armchair investigators are all left confused by what transpired in Las Vegas. There are so many theories, in fact, that YouTube has now tweaked its algorithm to protect you from questioning the official narrative, while regurgitating the mainstream media as an “authoritative source,” The Wall Street Journal reported.
“In response to criticism on social media of some search results this week, a person familiar with YouTube said the company is accelerating the rollout of planned changes to its search engine. On Wednesday night, the video service began promoting more authoritative sources in search results, especially pertaining to major news events, the person said. YouTube doesn’t disclose how it determines which sources are authoritative,” YouTube wrote in a statement.
The unthinkable, a shooting of a peaceful gathering for music interrupted by pelted gunfire which took the lives of 60 and injured hundreds of others. Perpetrated by the perfect criminal, a rich 64-year-old former accountant and real estate investor addicted to gambling who could afford 23 guns and thousands of rounds of ammunition for all of those firearms.
The shooting reportedly lasted five to fifteen minutes, though estimates vary according to the Washington Post.
While that in itself raises questions such as if there are multiple guns why would authorities rule out a second, third or even possible fourth shooter before any formal investigation? Especially since earlier police audio indicated that there might be more than one shooter.
The story certainly doesn’t end there. Since the October 1st shooting new facts have emerged as the “official narrative” of the shooting takes shape that just leaves you scratching your head thinking wtf?
The gunman set up cameras throughout the hall, under the serving cart and in front of the door to watch for police, yet now MSM news outlets are reporting that he may have been planning to escape. If true, his car had homemade explosives in it; so was he planning on martyrdom?
Yesterday, the narrative took an even more blurry weird turn as investigators finally admitted that a note was found on the scene but the note was alleged to be just numbers, no letters, just cryptic code according to authorities.
Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department Undersheriff Kevin McMahill confirmed the revelation in Friday’s press conference:
McMahill said Friday afternoon that police have yet to determine “what those numbers are or mean.”
“In the past, terror attacks or mass murder motive was made very clear by a note that was left, by a social media post, by a telephone call that was made, by investigators mining computer data,” Undersheriff McMahill said. “Today, in our investigation, we don’t have any of that uncovered. I wish we did. We will and are continuing to investigate with great tenacity and hope to arrive at an answer,” he added.
While a Las Vegas K9 police officer Dave Newton has alleged it was calculations about where the shooter needed to aim.
“I could see on it he had written the distance, the elevation he was on, the drop of what his bullet was gonna be for for the crowd,” Newton said. “So he had had that written down and figured out so he would know where to shoot to hit his targets from there.”
This explains the police secrecy behind this note, at first denying that any “suicide note” even existed, but was subsequently revealed in leaked photos from the crime scene which forced police to acknowledge it. Also revealed in the leaked pictures were several anomalies of the crime scene. One example is the way the shooter died with a firearm perched over the killer’s leg and what looked like empty shells above his head in a pool of blood that had not a squirt somehow on the top of any of the bullets. In short, the scene was impossible, it was too perfect. Both the shell casing and gun looked planted. Maybe that is why the photos were leaked along with the existence of the note left on the table?
If someone shot themselves in the head and the bullet casing was there from firing hundreds of shots ejected from the gun, that scene would be impossible as there would be blood all over the shells, not just floating in a murky pool. In order for this scenario to happen the killer would have had to have been sitting down on the ground with a gun across his leg and when he blew his brains out there would be blood all behind him covering the empty shell casings in blood. Instead, what we see is a scene where the killer is bleeding out his skull drooling out blood while all of the visible bullets themselves remain virtually clean from any brain tissue residue.
It’s more likely that the crime scene was tampered with and someone left the rifle on his leg to prove it. Why? Because as the early reports stated by police, they “neutralized the killer.”
After the situation settled down, the narrative was changed to death by suicide. In this writer’s opinion, by covering up simple facts like cause of death the police are only fueling the theory that the attack was a false flag. While they further refused until now to tell the public about the existence of the note and stated there was no motive that only furthers that divide.
Other things that don’t quite add up, Stephen Paddock’s girlfriend, Marilou Danley, is alleged to have worked at the hotel. Paddock used her key card to get around the place according to reports. Paddock’s car was held in a garage and security footage shows his vehicle leaving the facility, yet his key card was still used to get in the hotel when he was documented to have left the parking deck according to authorities. Then there is the recent discovery of a cell phone charger that didn’t match any of the cell phones used by the killer.
These are 2 major updates in regards to the #LasVegas shooter. https://t.co/pMAPPmpf0u pic.twitter.com/TmnyZOJMAG — Nick Short 🇺🇸 (@PoliticalShort) October 6, 2017
There is also the unconfirmed alleged room service receipt which shows that Paddock paid for a meal for two, mere days before he decided to commit his mass massacre. If confirmed, since it’s been reported he was scouting out several other festivals including Lalapalooza and a hotel in Chicago, it may mean he had help for his now-known premeditated murder spree.
Another fact barely getting any media coverage is that Paddock filmed himself during the incident, something widely known to be done by jihadists who commit attacks in the allegiance of ISIS.
Former Trump campaign official James Brower expanded on the video stating:
“There is a video, this video will prove the motive. He had a secret digital profile that was uncovered in the last 24 hours,” Brower tweeted.
Brower then later tweeted “Motive will be pretty shocking, I won’t say much but it will definitely change a lot of things going forward.”

Motive will be pretty shocking, I won’t say much but it will definitely change a lot of things going forward. — James B Scooping 🍦 (@jbro_1776) October 5, 2017
Brower revealed additional details to Infowars, “I’m being told the video basically speaks about a network, they wouldn’t tell me directly if it was ISIS but they threw little hints that it was,” he said. “The reason the video more than likely is never released is because they believe it will trigger the “cells” he speaks of.”
“There should be a statement on motive soon,” Brower added, “They believe he was inspired by ISIS.”
The FBI has denied that ISIS was responsible, stating they have found no evidence he was connected to the radical group.
ISIS claimed responsibility, stating Paddock converted to Islam 6 months ago but did not provide proof for their claims.
While police continue to echo earlier claims stating they are “confident … there was not another shooter in that room.” Albeit the facts above point to the potential that there was at least one other person involved in the tragedy.
However, Sheriff Joseph Lombardo has stated that you have to make the assumption he had some help at some point.
“Do you think this was all accomplished on his own?” Lombardo asked, noting the arsenal of weapons the shooter amassed, and the discovery of explosives in his car. He added: “You’ve got to make the assumption he had to have some help at some point.”
Meanwhile, the DOJ has just released a press release which states an indictment for three men who planned a similar plot to shoot up concerts in New York over the summer in the name of ISIL but were caught.
Abdulrahman El Bahnasawy, a 19-year-old citizen of Canada who pleaded guilty to terrorism charges, Talha Haroon, a 19-year-old U.S. citizen who lived in Pakistan and 37-year-old Russell Salic who is a citizen of the Philippines were all charged with terrorism-related charges.
The terror group released a propaganda video calling for attacks in May which specifically listed Las Vegas as an attack location, The Washington Times reported.
That video purportedly showed an American fighter calling for attacks in the U.S with images of the Las Vegas strip and Times Square as well as other potential Western targets, such as New York and Washington, according to NBC News.
The State Department issued a travel terror warning in mid-September of the threat ISIS poses to Americans mere weeks before the attack in Las Vegas.
“U.S. government facilities worldwide remain in a heightened state of alert. These facilities may temporarily close or periodically suspend public services to assess their security posture. In those instances, U.S. embassies and consulates will make every effort to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens. U.S. citizens abroad are urged to monitor the local news and maintain contact with the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate,” the warning read. “Terrorist groups including ISIS, al-Qa’ida, their associates, and those inspired by such organizations, are intent on attacking U.S. citizens wherever they are. Extremists may use conventional or non-conventional weapons to target U.S. government and private interests. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack to more effectively target crowds, including the use of edged weapons, pistols, and vehicles as weapons.”
Of particular interest, the State Dept noted that extremists increasingly aim to assault “soft” targets, such as:
high-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)
hotels, clubs, and restaurants
places of worship
schools
parks
shopping malls and markets
tourism infrastructure
public transportation systems
airports
There are way more questions left to be answered besides these, but these are the newest. For an early rundown on the shooting check out my article on Steemit here for a fair unbiased article exploring both sides of whether the shooting was a false flag or an ISIS attack. What we all know by now is this plot has too many elements to be the work of just one lone wolf who the media is now trying to push as mentally insane with health problems, but that would require dismissing the rest of the facts. None of this adds up.

716,"No Congo election until mid-2019, vote commission says, angering opposition","KINSHASA (Reuters) - An election to replace Congolese President Joseph Kabila cannot take place before April 2019, the electoral commission said, a delay that the opposition said would cause an impatient population to “take matters into its own hands”.
The schedule outlined by the electoral commission would torpedo an agreement between Kabila’s camp and his opponents to hold the election - originally scheduled for November 2016 - before the end of this year.
Dozens of people were killed last year in protests against Kabila’s refusal to step down at the end of his term. Parts of Democratic Republic of Congo are in the hands of insurgents who say they will not stop fighting while he remains in power.
The electoral commission, CENI, said in a statement following a meeting with civil society representatives on Tuesday that it would need at least 504 days to organize the poll once voter registration is completed.
Enrolment began in parts of Kasai, a region ravaged by insurrection, in mid-September and will take about three months, the commission says. That means the vote could not be organized until April 2019 at the earliest. CENI is expected to announce election dates this month.
“What the CENI has announced is not an electoral calendar but an election-killing agenda,” opposition leader Claudel Lubaya told Reuters.
“Everything now rests on the shoulders of the population, which must take matters into its own hands.”
The opposition suspects Kabila is trying to cling to power by postponing elections until he can find a way to remove term limits that prevent him from standing for re-election, as presidents in neighboring Rwanda and Congo Republic have done.
Kabila, who took power after his father Laurent Kabila was assassinated in 2001, denies that, and says the election delays are due to difficulties enrolling millions of voters and mobilizing hundreds of millions of dollars in financing.
His spokesman has repeatedly said that the electoral commission operates independently and that Kabila has no control over the timing of elections.
The head of the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Congo, Maman Sidikou, said CENI was badly underfunded. International donors have contributed only 6 percent of the $123 million that the United Nations had been expecting, he told the U.N. Security Council.
Congo has never experienced a peaceful transition of power and Kabila’s refusal to step down has fueled mounting insecurity across a country where millions died in regional conflicts between 1996-2003, most from hunger and disease.
An insurrection in Kasai has killed up to 5,000 people and displaced 1.4 million since August 2016, and militia violence has also spiked in the eastern borderlands, where dozens of armed groups are active.",fake
505,U.S. Based Charity Is Robbing Mexico's Indigenous Communities of Water,"By Derrick Broze
A religious charity based in the United States claims to be helping the poor, but in reality, Living Water is contributing to a shrinking water supply for Mexico’s indigenous communities.
A report from Open Democracy details a disturbing system of corporate and state privilege and theft of indigenous resources. Journalist Tamara Pearson investigated the situation in Puebla, Mexico, specifically looking at the activities of Coca Cola, the charity Living Water, and non-profit Techo. “Here, people living in the wealthy part of town get all the water they need, and Coca Cola gets first dibs on the best water in the state. Meanwhile, the rest us get running water for half an hour a week, or none at all,” Pearson writes.
Living Water, a U.S. based religious charity that claims to provide the poor with water, currently has 132 projects in the state of Puebla. The projects are the result of the Mexican government encouraging private industry to invest in ownership bodies of water. U.S. Senator Ted Cruz and his wife Heidi Cruz, VP of Goldman Sachs, are listed in the leadership of Living Water.
Tamara Pearson interviewed Fernando, an indigenous activist from the Nahua community of Cuanala, in northern Puebla, to get a better understanding of the situation. Fernando is part of the National Indigenous Congress (CNI) and to Peoples Against the Privatization of Water (PUCPA). He tells Pearson that charities like Living Water and Techo “pave the way” for corporations to gain access to indigenous and rural people’s water. Specifically, groups like Techo and Living Water have partnerships with companies like Femsa (Coca Cola) for financing projects in indigenous communities under the pretext of providing water. According to Fernando, once the charities get in the communities, their corporate partners use their influence to steal water.
“Living Water went into indigenous towns like Ocotepec saying things like ‘Jesus says water is for everyone.’ At first, people trusted them, but then they realized the charity has connections to Femsa (Coca Cola) and they protested. There were arrests, and the police stopped the protests,” Fernando told Pearson. “In January the current state government sent the various municipalities (of Puebla state) a document saying that we had to approve an article in the water law that gives the state, and therefore companies as well, control over our water. They gave us a month to respond, and if we didn’t, then we had automatically approved it.”
Fernando also said the government is attempting to shut down the wells that the indigenous communities have built. Pearson also reports that Article 12 of the new water law also makes it illegal to collect your own water via well or rain collection. The law limits communities like Fernando’s to 20 liters of water per person per day. This supply is not enough to drink, water crops, and care for animals.
Even worse, Pearson was able to document the glaring inequality and double standard between the indigenous and rural communities and the wealthier cities. Fernando told Pearson that the wealthy living in the cities do not face the same water restrictions as the indigenous.
“Unlike where the rest of us live – where we get 30 minutes of water a week, if we’re lucky, and so we store that water in tanks on our roofs – in Angelopolis there are no tanks,” Pearson reports. “They have unlimited water, doing things the rest of us wouldn’t dream of, like filling their swimming pools, hosing down their patios and foot paths, and washing their pets regularly with a hose.”
The report also notes that Coca Cola continues to extract water from the sides of the Huitepec volcano in Chiapas. This water is taken away from the local indigenous communities and sold elsewhere for a high profit.
Fernando told Pearson that the fight for water security is a part of a larger struggle for land security. “We don’t waste water by washing it down the drains. We recycle it. The fight for water is a fight for life. You can’t separate water from land issues and struggles, from the economy, and from conflict and peace and justice,” he said.
The situation in Mexico has the appearance of yet another example of private industry using influence to screw over the people. However, on closer examination we can see that it was the state which first passed a law to give these charities and corporations the legal path for seizing local water supplies. At the end of the day, the people are opposed by an octopus with many tentacles. The corporations and the State work together to fleece the people, but without the corrupt politicians and government officials, the corporations would not be able to wield such power. We must decentralize and unplug from these systems and focus our efforts on building local community reliance. If I was you I would start here.

U.S. President Trump said he would be open to bilateral pacts with Canada and Mexico if NAFTA talks fail, Brexit talks continued in Brussels but with little sign of progress and Delta Airlines said it would refuse to pay tariffs on Bombardier’s CSeries jets.
NAFTA
U.S. President Donald Trump said he was open to bilateral trade pacts with either Canada or Mexico if a three-way deal cannot be reached to substantially revise the North American Free Trade Agreement. Trump’s comments came at a White House meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who was in Washington to promote NAFTA’s benefits as a new round of renegotiations began near Washington.
Business leaders say no NAFTA better than bad deal
Washington
The U.S. House of Representatives is expected to approve $36.5 billion in emergency relief for hurricane-hit areas such as Florida, Texas, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, as well as California, struck by devastating wildfires.
Trump finds himself under immense pressure as he considers de-certifying the international nuclear deal with Iran, a move that would ignore warnings from inside and outside his administration that to do so would risk undermining U.S. credibility. Trump is expected to unveil a broad strategy on confronting Iran this week. There was always the chance he could still have a last-minute change of heart and certify Iran’s compliance with the 2015 accord, which he has called an “embarrassment” and the “worst deal ever negotiated.”

Delta is the only major U.S. carrier to buy the CSeries so far, and Bastian called the U.S. Commerce Department’s decision to impose anti-dumping duties on the jets “nonsensical.”

President Donald Trump speaks during the opening of his “Cut the Red Tape” deregulation summit to highlight efforts underway to reduce government rules that hinder private businesses and infrastructure projects. The summit will “highlight the president’s broader initiatives on regulatory reform,” a senior administration official told reporters on Friday. The administration hopes to show that “the regulatory burden is being lifted, that agencies are working hard at accomplishing the president’s directives, and that this is making a difference both to the economy and to job creation.” During the summit, 10 federal agencies will hold breakout sessions to discuss the efforts in their departments and agencies to eliminate burdensome regulations. Trump has eliminated or delayed more than 800 proposed regulations since being elected which the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) says has saved more than $300 million. “We are making good on that promise at OIRA,” OIRA Administrator Naomi Rao said. “So far, we’ve finalized four new regulatory rulemakings and 10 deregulatory rulemakings.” The results have been “quite remarkable,” she said. Trump will deliver his remarks from the East Room of the White House just after 11 AM EDT.

2944,EU pesticide debate needs more 'independent expertise': Macron,"French President Emmanuel Macron reacts during a joint press conference with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) following their meeting at the Elysee Palace in Paris, France, October 9, 2017. REUTERS/Ludovic Marin/Pool
PARIS (Reuters) - France and the European Union need independent scientific experts to guide them on divisive environmental issues such as pesticides, French President Emmanuel Macron said, criticizing some research as prone to lobbying pressures.
The EU has struggled to find a consensus on farming questions such as pesticides and genetically modified crops, and is still debating whether to extend the license of popular weedkiller glyphosate.
In a speech on food and farming on Wednesday, Macron reiterated France’s support for phasing out glyphosate, and argued that independent expertise along with investment in innovations would bring solutions to environmental problems.
“I would like us to be able to bring together the conditions whereby we can have independent scientific expertise on each of these (environmental) subjects and that we have the same requirements at EU level,” he said.
“We have endured too much pressure in recent years on these questions, too many hidden interests and industry expertise that is in no way scientific expertise.”
He repeated a pledge to change the law in France to prevent suppliers from simultaneously selling pesticides and advising farmers.
The EU debate on glyphosate, first developed by U.S. group Monsanto and the most popular weedkiller worldwide, has brought competing claims about its safety, dividing scientists, farmers, chemical firms and politicians.
France has opposed a European Commission proposal to renew the EU license for glyphosate for another 10 years.
“I think the right debate to have is to say that it’s not a good idea at EU level to put the glyphosate issue to one side for another 10 years,” Macron said.
The president cited innovation to reduce pesticide use as one way of revamping French agriculture, along with proposals to offer better price terms for farmers.",fake
166,5 Things to Think About,"By Tony Cartalucci
Headlines and commentary across both Eastern and Western media have mainly focused on the Catalan independence referendum and the actions of Spanish police and the Spanish government’s attempts to disrupt polls.
However, little is being said about what the real implications of Catalan independence may be. What do those politicians in Catalonia in favor of independence seek to do with it should they succeed? Will they create a Catalonia that serves the best interests of the people? Or serve the EU and NATO more efficiently and eagerly than a united Spain ever could?
There are 5 points those following this conflict should know and keep in mind as events unfold:
1. Catalonia has a formidable industrialized economy relative to other regions of Spain, with a GDP and population just exceeding those of nations like Scotland or Singapore, and likely could achieve and sustain independence from Spain.
2. NATO appears eager to encourage independence and would welcome what they expect to be a robust military capability to add to their wars of global aggression.
An article published in 2014 by the Atlantic Council – a Fortune 500-funded NATO think tank – titled, “The Military Implications of Scottish and Catalonian Secession,” would state:
Catalonia has 7.3 million people, with more than $300 billion in GDP. Spending just 1.6% of that on defense provides over $4.5 billion annually, or roughly the budget of Denmark, which has well-regarded and efficient armed forces. Catalonian military plans are more vague, but so far, they emphasize the navy. With excellent ports in Barcelona and Tarragona, Catalonia is well-positioned as a minor naval power, ‘with the Mediterranean as our strategic environment, and NATO as our framework’, as the nationalists’ think-tank on defense argues. The rough plans call for a littoral security group of a few hundred sailors at first. After a few years, Catalonia would assume responsibility as “a main actor in the Mediterranean,” with land-based maritime patrol aircraft and small surface combatants. Eventually, the nationalist ambition may include an expeditionary group with a light assault carrier and hundreds of marines, to take a serious role in collective security.
The Atlantic Council piece would emphatically conclude that:
If accurately characterized by the few white papers that have surfaced, the separatists’ position suggests a valuable and refreshing view of specialization in collective defense: build a navy that is comparatively focused on influencing events ashore.
3. Pro-independence Catalan politicians appear to enthusiastically support Catalonia’s membership in NATO.
…when the next Afghanistan comes, Catalan blood will also be spilled.
A 2014 article titled, “Catalan PM confirms NATO membership, commitment to collective security,” stated:
Prime Minister Artur Mas explicitly confirmed Catalonia is seeking NATO membership. In a recent interview with the Italian daily La Reppublica, Catalan Prime Minister Artur Mas explained that an independent Catalonia sees herself at the heart of NATO. This is in line with Catalonia’s commitment to the international community, the principle of collective security, international law, and the rule of law at sea.
The article also claims:
Catalonia seeks freedom, not to avoid the inescapable responsibilities that come hand in hand with it, but to fully exercise them side by side with partners and allies. Catalans understand fully that freedom never comes without cost, and that whereas independence means government of the people, by the people, and for the people, instead of alien rule, it also means that they will not be able to look the other way when a crisis or challenge arises. They understand that when the next Afghanistan comes, Catalan blood will also be spilled.
In essence, Catalan politicians appear eagerly committed not only to NATO, but to the foreign wars of aggression it wages, and spilling the blood of its people to help NATO fight them.
4. Some Catalan politicians have begun planning for its military’s integration into NATO.
The pro-independence Catalan National Assembly’s Defense Policy Working Group has stated in a 2014 paper titled, “Dimensions of the Catalan Defence Forces: Naval Forces (Executive Summary),” that:
The Mediterranean: our strategic environment. NATO: our framework Wire Tapped America - New Free Book (Ad) Catalonia must participate in SNMG2 (Standing NATO Maritime Group 2; formerly Standing Naval Force Mediterranean), a component of the NRF (NATO Response Force). It would also be convenient to participate in the SNMCMG2 (Standing NATO Mine Countermeasures Group 2).
5. Like “Kurdistan,” any sort of “independence” is meaningless if the resulting state finds itself utterly dependent and entwined with Western hegemony and the institutions that maintain it – especially at the cost of member states and proxies – be they Kurdish or Catalan.
That Catalonia’s politicians have already openly and eagerly pledged Catalan blood and treasure to foreign interests and the wars they seek to fight across the globe, suggests that the notion of Catalonia actually achieving any sort of “independence” is actually Catalonia simply becoming more dependent on an even greater master, and one even further abroad.
Further Thoughts
These 5 points should be considered by those for and against Catalan independence. While Catalonia could create for itself a lasting and meaningful independence underpinned by peace and prosperity for its people, it appears that many in senior leadership positions intend to simply shift Catalonia’s subservience from Madrid to Brussels.
Further questions regarding Catalonia’s economy remain – including what an independent Catalonia might do to help feed larger, foreign corporations who may seek to circumvent barriers and obstacles in Spain’s current economic climate, and exploit an “independent” Catalonia, its people, markets, and resources. Unfortunately, such economic policies and their fallout may unfold long after it is possible for the people of Catalonia to do anything about it.
For the Catalan people dedicated to independence, they must find and use the local, socioeconomic leverage necessary to direct their potentially independent nation toward a trajectory that best serves them and their future – not a handful of Catalan politicians eagerly serving interests in Brussels, London, or Washington.

2738,Bristol Bay: 'Most valuable salmon fishery in the world',"(CNN) This year, 56 million sockeye salmon swam hundreds of miles from the ocean toward the rivers and streams of the Bristol Bay watershed in southwest Alaska.
Many that escaped fishermen and bears leapt over waterfalls and used a mysterious combination of the Earth's magnetic field and their own sensory memories to locate the exact streams where they were born -- and then spawned, made gravel nests for their young, and died.
""It seems like a heroic -- and perhaps tragic -- life cycle,"" said Thomas Quinn, a professor at the University of Washington who has been studying fish in Bristol Bay for 30 years.
The salmon's incredible migration also sustains people: Nearly half of the world's sockeye catch comes from this one region, which is one of the last, great salmon fisheries on Earth. The returning salmon and other ecological resources create some 14,000 full- and part-time jobs, generate about $480 million annually -- and support 4,000-year-old Alaska Native cultures.
Now, however, Quinn and others fear this cycle could be strained if not broken.
For more than 15 years, Northern Dynasty Minerals, a Canadian mining company, has sought to build a gold and copper mine in Bristol Bay. And this spring, the Trump administration took swift action to make that prospect more likely.
Environmental Protection Agency head Scott Pruitt met on May 1 with the CEO of the Pebble Limited Partnership, a subsidiary of the mining company, CNN reported on September 22 based on interviews and government emails. Little more than an hour later, according to internal emails, the administrator directed his staff to reverse Obama-era protections for Bristol Bay, which had been created after years of scientific review. Based on that work, the previous administration had aimed to pre-emptively veto certain mining activities in the ecologically important region.
Pebble still would have to apply for permits before building a mine in Bristol Bay. Two public hearings will be held in Alaska on the topic this week. And the public has until October 17 to comment on Pruitt's proposed policy reversal before it could be finalized.
'Complete loss of fish habitat...'
Driftnet fishing for sockeye salmon along the Nushagak River.
Among the critics likely to contact the agency are representatives from Alaska Native communities in Bristol Bay, as well as scientists like Quinn, who has dedicated his professional life to researching the area.
""This is the jewel in the crown of America's fisheries resources, this salmon,"" Quinn told CNN. ""If you don't think this is worth saving, what is? If you don't think that (a gold and copper mine) is going to constitute a threat, what would? To me, if you don't draw a line in the sand here, there's none to be drawn anywhere. You're saying that no resource, no matter how valuable, is off-limits to development -- no matter how obviously deleterious.""
Quinn's concerns are based on his years researching the bay, which were incorporated into a 2014 EPA report on Bristol Bay under the Obama administration. The report, which also was based on Pebble's filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, estimated the total mine site could be larger than Manhattan and nearly as deep as the Grand Canyon.
Such a mine ""would result in complete loss of fish habitat due to elimination, dewatering, and fragmentation of streams, wetlands, and other aquatic resources"" in some areas of the bay watershed, the EPA found after three years of peer-reviewed research. In particular, the EPA estimated 22 miles of streams and more than 6 square miles of wetlands and other habitats that are important to salmon and other fish would be lost to a large-scale mine.
""All of these losses would be irreversible,"" the agency said.
'This is exactly the worst place you could imagine building a mine'
Based on that science, the agency made a rare call: In 2014, the EPA proposed pre-emptively vetoing certain mining activities in Bristol Bay because of the ecological risks. It did so under a rarely used provision of the Clean Water Act, Section 404(c).
Pruitt's EPA, however, contends Pebble should be allowed to submit permit applications before the merits of its project are judged. ""EPA's review will be based on the whole record, all the science and an actual proposal from the company,"" EPA spokeswoman Liz Bowman told CNN.
Pebble plans to file permit applications in December, said Tom Collier, the company's CEO. The mine proposal will be much smaller than the EPA expected, he said, and not ecologically damaging. In a recent presentation before Alaska's Resource Development Council, which was posted on the company's website, Collier indicated Pebble hopes to develop a mine that would cover 5.4 square miles, with the total mine site occupying 12.7 square miles. The mine would be developed in a ""safe, environmentally responsible manner,"" the company said.
Wood Tikchik State Park, Alaska.
Some researchers, however, maintain the company's approach is shortsighted at best.
""Under the Obama administration, people were willing to say, 'Look, it's very clear, this is exactly the worst place you could imagine building a mine of that kind,"" said Ray Hilborn, a professor in the School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences at the University of Washington. ""It's not just that you have the most valuable salmon fishery in the world, it's the nature of the habitat there. The reason it's such a productive salmon place is, it's basically this giant gravel bed. But that also means it's almost impossible to contain water. It's just a giant sponge. The idea you could store highly toxic waste (from a mine) forever behind a dam is just ridiculous.""
""I'm sure once a proposal is put on the table, geologists will be able to say, look, it's a no-brainer, you can't contain this stuff forever,"" he said.
'It is a lot more cost-effective not to screw up a salmon run'
Healthy watersheds like Bristol Bay were once much more common.
Most have been severely degraded or ruined, said David R. Montgomery, a professor of geomorphology at the University of Washington and author of ""King of Fish: The Thousand-Year Run of Salmon."" The Atlantic and Pacific coasts of the United States once had sizable salmon runs, he said. What remains, mostly in the Pacific, is a faint memory of what once was, he said, thanks largely to dams, urbanization, habitat loss and industrial activities like mining.
Source: ""Atlas of Pacific Salmon,"" 2005
The ""poster child"" for this inefficiency is the Columbia River system in the Pacific Northwest, he said, which has 18 major dams, making it much more difficult for salmon to migrate.
""It is a lot more cost-effective not to screw up a salmon run in the first place. There's no question about that,"" Montgomery said. ""We've spent an awful lot on the Columbia relative to what we have to show for it.""
It's unclear exactly what percentage of Alaskans would support mining in Bristol Bay. But in a 2014 statewide ballot, two-thirds of voters chose to give the Alaska legislature power to approve or veto large-scale mining projects in the area if the projects threaten fisheries.
Some Alaskans do support the Pebble project because of the economic jolt it could bring. The EPA's 2014 assessment says the mine would employ more than 1,000 people during its lifespan, and more than 2,000 people during the shorter construction phase. The mine would be expected to create $300 billion to $500 billion in revenue over the life of the project, the EPA estimated.
Initially, Thomas Tilden, a Bristol Bay commercial fisherman and first chief of the Curyung Tribal Council, in the Bristol Bay area, was impressed by these arguments, too.
Tilden says he's not anti-development. His father was a gold miner from California. But after the mine was first proposed, he said, he started touring mines that had been shut down.
He saw pools of toxic water, massive piles of waste-rock. At one mine in Nevada, he said, he was told to cover his shoes for fear he would track dust laden with heavy metals home -- and ""not to have any contact with that dust with our eyes, not to touch any of the water.""
Could Bristol Bay turn into a similar wasteland? He decided he didn't want to find out.
'It will be the end of the line for these traditional salmon cultures'
Sockeye salmon find their way from the ocean to their natal stream.
In 2010, Tilden was one of several local indigenous leaders who sent a letter to the EPA asking the agency to study the bay and consider protecting it from a mine.
In doing so, he said, he thought of the cultural value of the salmon, including the first salmon ritual. In that informal ceremony, the first salmon to wriggle upstream to a village are caught and given to elders as a sign of gratitude -- both to the elder, who has kept village traditions alive, and to the salmon, which have returned to feed the people.
""If you've ever seen the face of an elder receiving the first salmon -- the happiness, the glow that they have, is just really heart-moving,"" he said. ""It's tremendous.""
Indigenous people have subsisted on wild salmon in Bristol Bay for 4,000 years, said Alan Boraas, an anthropology professor at Kenai Peninsula College who conducted dozens of interviews with tribal elders as part of the 2014 EPA assessment.
If there are other people left like that in the world, he hasn't been able to find them.
Source: Scottish Natural Heritage
""If we don't make some good decisions, it will be the end of the line for these traditional salmon cultures,"" he said. ""I believe this is the most significant environmental issue in the United States today. (The development of Pebble) would establish a precedent that I believe would absolutely extinguish the traditional salmon cultures and force them into modernity.""
Some villages, Boraas said, practice a baptismal ceremony in Bristol Bay's waters. Instead of baptizing people in the river, however, they baptize the water itself.
""In human terms, baptism is to remove original sin. In this case, baptism of the water is to remove human-caused pollution -- to make the water pure for the salmon to return.""
For now, millions of salmon still return every year.
But Tilden and others worry: How long will that continue?

3379,Breaking Bad house owners build fence after pizza stunts,"Image copyright Amc/ Alex Proimos Image caption The owners of the New Mexico home are sick of cleaning pizza thrown by fans
If you have seen the popular TV series Breaking Bad, you probably remember a scene in which Walter White angrily tosses a pizza onto his own roof.
In the years since, fans have travelled to recreate the stunt, landing the real-life owner with hours of cleaning.
The show's creator even stepped in in 2015, asking the pranksters to stop.
Now the owner has reached breaking point, according to local media, building a 6ft iron fence to keep people, and their pizzas, out.
In the programme, actor Brian Cranston chucks the pizza after his wife discovers his drug-dealing alter-ego and refuses to let him in the house.
Frank Sandoval, who runs a local Breaking Bad tour company, told local news station Kob4 that he has had to climb onto the roof to pull pizzas thrown by tourists down.
Joanne Quintana said her mother, the owner of the house, has had to deal with hundreds of people over the last few years trespassing, taking photographs and even attempting to steal rocks as souvenirs.
""We feel like we can't leave because when we, do something happens and that's ridiculous,"" she said.
The crime-thriller ended four years ago but creator Vince Gilligan scolded fans on a 2015 podcast about their behaviour while sightseeing.
""There is nothing original, or funny, or cool about throwing a pizza on this lady's roof,"" Gilligan said.
""It's been done before, you're not the first.""

The Las Vegas Police Department on Friday released a video that would appear to debunk NFL national anthem protest ringleader Michael Bennett’s claim that he was racially profiled during an arrest in August. Bennett was in Sin City attending the Mayweather-McGregor title bout and afterward, went to a club where what a call to investigate a possible shooting resulted in police being sent to the scene. Upon their arrival, the Seattle Seahawks $31.5 million defensive lineman and social justice activist was deemed to be acting suspiciously – hiding behind a machine and taking flight – which resulted in him being briefly detained by officers. Bennett claimed that a gun was held to his head and that he was in fear for his life (no video to either confirm or rebut this exists) and that the police used excessive force and that he was the victim of racial profiling. The second accusation was nonsense because there were many blacks at the club at the time of the call although they weren’t acting in a manner that attracted the attention of officers. Sheriff Joe Lombardo defended his officers and rebutted claims of the racial profiling, another video showed that despite his claims, …

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India’s top court on Monday temporarily banned the sale of firecrackers in and around the capital ahead of Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights, as it looks to prevent a repeat of severe air pollution that forced school closures last year.
New Delhi's air quality has hit ""very unhealthy"" levels, U.S. Embassy data shows. This is often blamed on burning of unwanted vegetation on farms in neighboring states, usual at this time of year, worsened by fumes from fireworks. (bit.ly/2eZOb9H)
The ban takes effect immediately and will run until Nov. 1, said a panel of Supreme Court judges headed by Justice Arjan Kumar Sikri, adding its impact on the region’s air quality would have to be examined after the festival.
“All temporary licenses to sell firecrackers stand canceled,” said Haripriya Padmanabhan, a lawyer representing the group that sought the ban.
“People who had already purchased crackers will be able to burst them. Hopefully they won’t do that,” she told Asian News International, a partner of Reuters Television.
Diwali, traditionally ushered in with the setting off of firecrackers mainly by India’s majority Hindu community, falls on Oct. 19 this year.
The government welcomed the move, with Environment Minister Harsh Vardhan requesting people to abide by the order.
FILE PHOTO: Commuters make their way through heavy smog in New Delhi, India, October 31, 2016. REUTERS/Adnan Abidi/File photo
But others, including Priti Gandhi, a leader from Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalist party, saw it as an attack on tradition and Hindu culture.
“We Indians will protest and burn crackers,” wrote one Twitter user, Ishkaran Bhandari. “We will uphold our culture, traditions and celebrate Diwali.”
Last November, about a million children were forced to stay home from school, thousands of workers reported sick and queues formed outside shops selling face masks as New Delhi struggled with its worst pollution for nearly 20 years.
Vehicle emissions and dust from construction sites were the factors blamed for that spike, besides firecrackers and farm burnings.
India and China together account for more than half of the 4.2 million deaths attributable to air pollution worldwide in 2015, a study by the U.S.-based Health Effects Institute (HEI) showed.
Global environmental group Greenpeace said the court ban on crackers was only a small relief for the “episodic air pollution levels in October”.
“The pollution levels in north India are multiple times higher than the national standards throughout the winter months, hence we also need to look at a stricter, comprehensive and time-bound action plan to address all sources of air pollution across India,” a Greenpeace India spokeswoman said.

516,Buy ‘Em or Deny ‘Em: Is Now The Time To Move On From Mike Gilislee?,"Buy ‘Em or Deny ‘Em: Is Now The Time To Move On From Mike Gilislee?
(Before It's News)
by Eric Stashin (aka The Rotoprofessor)
The assumption was that Mike Gillislee would step into the LeGarrette Blount role for the Patriots, meaning an opportunity would be there to be a force on a weekly basis. Blount thrived in New England last season, racking up 1,161 yards and 18 TD, and after two weeks it looked like Gillislee could put up a similar line:
First Two Games – 33 carries, 114 yards, 4 TD
He’s continued to see carries in the subsequent three games, with 12 carries per contest, but the results have not been impressive:
Next Three Games – 36 carries, 132 yards, 0 TD
The carries have been down, and there could be a variety of reasons (i.e. game flow), but the bigger issue is that the numbers demonstrate how TD dependent he is. Even over those first two games, when he was averaging a few more carries (16.5 carries per game), without the TD he would’ve been a worthless fantasy play.
Overall he’s averaging 3.6 yards/carry and there’s a chance that the opportunities start to diminish. Dion Lewis outgained Gillislee in Week 5, with 53 yards on just 7 carries. Over the past two weeks he has 71 yards and 1 TD on 11 carries (6.5 yards/carry), after getting 8 carries over the first three weeks of the season.
It’s easy to forget that, when on the field, Lewis has been a productive runner for New England over the past two seasons. He was limited to 14 games, but he totaled 113 carries and 517 yards (4.6 yards/carry). Maybe he’s capped at 8-10 touches per game, as a way to keep him healthy, but those touches will come at the expense of Gillislee.
We’ve long been skeptical about New England, as you never truly know what they are going to do on a weekly basis. Of course, given Lewis’ history there’s always the risk that he goes down and misses time (and that will give Gilislee a little bit more value once again). For now he’s going to remain a TD dependent FLEX play, and that means you can only utilize him if you are desperate.
As far as targeting him in a trade, it’s hard to consider him a buy low candidate. In fact, if you can still deal him for a premium we’d be far more likely to cut bait and trade him as opposed to letting him take up a spot at the back of your roster and never being willing to put him in an active role.

404,Smart Billboards Target Individual Motorists and Spy on License Plates and Cellphones,"By MassPrivateI
Editor’s Note: This is the Minority Report world we have entered. Please also see the article by Nicholas West which covers the use of billboards to predict people’s political views. This is already being used in many areas around the world; it’s called “neuropolitics.” Naturally, this is terrific for advertisers in our digitally connected world of smart devices that monitor us at all times.
Imagine driving down a highway and seeing a personalized billboard ad directed at you. Now imagine advertisers using billboards to send messages to your smartphone.
That’s the future of’ ‘advertised spying’ in America. (Yes, I made that term up.)
An article in McClatchy, warns that a new generation of “smart digital billboards will detect the make, model and year of oncoming vehicles and project ads tailored to the motorist.”
The article ominously warns that smart billboards can guess a motorist’s home address, age, race and income level based on the vehicle they are driving. And also claims that advertisers will be able to send messages to a person’s smartphone as they pass by a smart billboard.
Companies like SYNAPS want to create a network of spying billboards.
SYNAPS, boasts about ‘designing intelligent sensors that recognize car models and help a billboard choose the best message for their drivers’.
SYNAPS, describes how advertisers can personalize their advertising…
It really is up to you to choose who will see your advertising – and it does not matter, where the billboard is. Pick your segment based on a specific car model and age, car price or size, or even how conservative or modern it is. (Source)
MIT’s connection to spying billboards
SYNAPS, appears to have gotten its start in Russia, as a recent article in MIT Technology Review points out.
Co-founders Alex Pustov and Alesky Utkin expect to be operating 20-50 smart billboards in Russia this year. They also claim to encrypt all the license plate data they collect.
Would you trust a foreign company with our license plate data?
What is MIT’s connection to SYNAPS?
According to SYNAPS, their American business is located at MIT’s Martin Trust in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
What does Martin Trust do?
They claim to supply students with ‘support and connections to become effective entrepreneurs’.
Martin Trust also claims, they nurture and assist new companies and make sure they have long-term success.
The McClatchy article warned, that smart billboards can spy on cellphones.
Smart billboards can also target motorists on the highway or pedestrians passing bus shelters by picking up cellular or mobile signatures, WiFi signals or even beaconing given off by certain apps. (Source)
Unfortunately, universities helping companies or government agencies to spy on the public has become the norm. (Click here to read how 200 universities are working with DHS.)
Would you trust a foreign company with our license plate and cellphone data? Will American law enforcement have access to that data?
SYNAPS is not the only company using smart billboards to target and track our travel patterns. Since 2015, automakers Lexus, GM and Chevrolet (seen below) have been using smart billboards to spy on motorists.
Earlier this year, General Motors received requests from numerous automotive companies and car dealerships to purchase their smart billboards. FYI, GM has also been using facial recognition billboards to spy on people.
Last year, Yahoo patented a smart billboard that uses cameras and microphones to spy on everyone.
The search giant has received a patent for a ‘smart billboard’ that uses cameras, microphones and a range of sensors to capture information of passers-by for ad targeting purposes. The sensors, cameras and microphones would work together to gather information about passers-by for ad targeting purposes. FREE Stormproof, Waterproof Survival Match Kit (Ad) (Source)
There’s no getting around it, smart billboards are really corporate ‘advertised spying’ devices.
Smart billboards collect cellphone data
Last year, New York Senator Chuck Schumer warned everyone that smart billboards are spying on our cell phones.
Clear Channel uses ‘Radar Analytics’ to spy on Americans’ travel and conversations. (Click here to watch the video.)
The official party line is to say the data they collect is anonymized. But as I have stated numerous times, that’s not the case. (Click here, here & here to find out more.)
We should assume that law enforcement will have access to smart billboard data just like they have with CCTV cameras.
Smart billboards coupled with CCTV cameras will create a huge surveillance network that would rival the United Kingdom for the most spied on nation in the world.

(Before It's News)
This week has seen London play host to the bids of France, South Africa and Ireland to stage the 2023 Rugby World Cup, with the respective bidding teams displaying their respective wares in front of World Rugby.
With France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, deciding that he couldn’t be arsed to attend the presentation or endorse the French bid, France’s bidding team turned to an ingenious (although somewhat bizarre) Plan B by choosing to parade the young sons of New Zealand rugby legend, Jonah Lomu as part of the bid. Jonah quite liked France, apparently. Which is nice.
South Africa’s strategy, meanwhile, appeared to be based on the fact that they once hosted the Rugby World Cup well over 20 years ago when that very nice, smiley man Nelson Mandela was President. No mention, surprisingly, that for financial reasons South Africa had recently decided against bidding to host the 2022 Commonwealth Games.
And as for the Irish, apparently if Ireland wins the bid to host the World Cup in 2023 it will somehow (and I kid you not) make rugby incredibly popular in the United States of America. Call me naive, but wouldn’t hosting the event in the USA be more likely to do that?
Go figure, and while you’re doing that please bear in mind that the Irish bid has also won the backing of UK Prime Minister Theresa May. What could possibly go wrong?

3450,Mysterious DHS Towers In NYC – Are These Radiation Detectors?,"By Aaron Kesel
 
Mysterious metal towers have appeared popping up at local tunnels, and soon they’ll start appearing at bridges, too, but the authorities aren’t stating what they are. Could these be radiation detection devices?
 
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has announced a transformational plan to re-imagine New York’s crossings for the 21st century which includes deploying cutting-edge technology and security personnel to high-profile crossings in New York to enhance public safety and fortify anti-terror efforts, a press release stated.
 
The strange metallic towers are part of a $100 million MTA outline called the New York Crossings Project shrouded in secrecy, with 18 of them planned for tunnels and bridges across New York.
 
Even people on the MTA board in charge of the towers can’t say why they’re being used or what’s in them, CBS2 reported.
 
A CBS2 reporter demanded answers from MTA’s Chairman Joe Lhota, and the answer they got was that the peculiar pylons are Homeland Security items.
 
Reporter: “Some of your own board members say they don’t know the specifics.”
 
 
 
 
 
Lhota: “The base of these new pieces that are going up include whatever fiber optics are necessary for those Homeland Security items.”
 
So with Homeland Security’s involvement, one can presume that these towers are anti-terror related. These new devices being radiation detectors isn’t at all a long stretch.
 
In 2009, NY Daily News reported that radiation detectors called “Advanced Spectroscopic Portal Monitors,” $450,000 devices, were given to the NYPD by the Department of Homeland Security. Those devices were placed on a trio of SUVs at entrances to tunnels, bridges and toll booths according to the publication.
 
The paper further stated that the NYPD stationed a sophisticated radiation-detecting device called the Thermo-Fissure Portal Monitor – which costs $100,000, at a July 4th celebration at the retired battleship Intrepid.
 
It’s been 8 years since that report; last year authorities increased radiation detection capabilities across agency assets according to a port authority press release.
 
A news agency based in New York, Reinvent Albany asked the Authorities Budget Office to investigate whether the MTA board met its fiduciary duty, and was fully informed, before approving contracts related to the governor’s NY Crossings program on MTA bridges and tunnels. $47m worth of expenses for decorative towers at the entrance to the Battery and Queens Midtown Tunnels.
 
They question whether the MTA board knew what it was doing when it approved $47m worth of expenses for “decorative towers at the entrance to the Battery and Queens Midtown Tunnels,” the publication wrote.
 
 
American Natural Superfood - Free Sample (Ad)
 
Some MTA board members, including New York City Transportation Commissioner Polly Trottenberg, stated that they know little about the towers – even though money has been spent and some of the towers are already up.
 
“A lot of the board members felt they didn’t have all the details they would have wanted, myself included,” she said.
 
It’s all speculation at this point what those metallic decorative towers are and what their purpose is, but it doesn’t seem outlandish to think that these are advanced radiation detection towers for preventing a potential bombing at infrastructure throughout New York, with the goal of protecting those bridges and tunnels, especially since Homeland Security is involved.

972,"E.U., Citing Amazon and Apple, Tells Nations to Collect Tax","European officials are increasingly trying to counter that narrative.
On Wednesday, Margrethe Vestager, the European Union’s competition commissioner, ordered Luxembourg to collect around 250 million euros, or about $293 million, in unpaid taxes from Amazon. The ruling was tied to an agreement between the country and the company that the European Commission, the bloc’s executive arm, said dated to 2003.
The order resembles a similar move the commission made last year, when it directed Ireland to reclaim around $15.2 billion from Apple.
Ireland fears that such a decision could make it a less attractive place for multinational companies. In a sign of the disquiet in Dublin about that order, the Irish government failed to meet a January deadline to collect the money. It has appealed the ruling.
That earned Ireland a forceful rebuke from Ms. Vestager.
A year later, “Ireland has not recovered any money, not even in part,” she said, warning the country to accelerate its efforts to avoid “more conflictual waters,” a reference to the prospects for a lengthy court battle.
Although litigation to force Ireland to recoup the taxes could drag on for years, the commission has successfully sued countries in the past and punished them with large fines for failing to recover money from companies that received illegal state aid.
At the time of the ruling, Europe’s competition watchdogs said that Apple’s arrangements with Dublin were illegal and had ensured the iPhone maker paid virtually nothing on its European business in some years. Brussels argued that the deals allowed Apple to funnel profit from two Irish subsidiaries to an office in which it had “no employees, no premises, no real activities.”
The Irish Department of Finance said that it “has never accepted the commission’s analysis” in the Apple case and that it was taken aback by Ms. Vestager’s decision to take the country to court. The department said it had “made significant progress on this complex issue” and accused the European authorities of taking a “wholly unnecessary step.”

Apple did not immediately comment on the latest move, but has criticized the ruling in the past. The original decision has also drawn the ire of the United States Treasury Department.

In the case of Amazon, the commission said Wednesday that Luxembourg had reduced its tax bill for more than eight years, from 2006 to 2014, and had conferred on the company a selective advantage. The arrangement essentially capped the amount of tax that the retailer paid, and relied on a method known as transfer pricing.
Typically, transfer pricing has been used by companies to assign revenues and profits to different business units depending on their location, role in the overall company and assets. But that system is harder to police with technology companies because many of their biggest assets, like intellectual property, are intangible. The European Commission said that Amazon had abused this system by sending most of its European revenue to a Luxembourg subsidiary that was not liable to pay corporate tax, helping the company cut its overall bill.
Ms. Vestager said the arrangement had “no valid economic justification” and that the company had been able to “avoid taxation on almost three quarters of the profits it made from all Amazon sales in the E.U.”
Amazon and Luxembourg have denied the charges.
“We believe that Amazon did not receive any special treatment from Luxembourg,” the company said in a statement on Wednesday, adding that it “paid tax in full accordance with both Luxembourg and international tax law.”
Amazon said it would study the commission’s ruling and was considering whether to appeal.
In a statement, Luxembourg’s finance ministry also contested Ms. Vestager’s ruling. “As Amazon has been taxed in accordance with the tax rules applicable at the relevant time, Luxembourg considers that the company has not been granted incompatible state aid,” it said.
It is not illegal in the European Union for member states to attempt to lure businesses by lowering corporate tax rates. But, as with Amazon’s agreement with Luxembourg, offering special deals to select companies that are not made available to rivals can amount to “illegal state aid.”
The investigations are among several in which commission officials have looked into the affairs of Silicon Valley companies. Regulators in Brussels are challenging Google and Qualcomm over alleged antitrust violations, and officials in various countries have investigated Facebook over its handling of customers’ data.
Ms. Vestager has made taxes a priority of her term as Europe’s competition commissioner. In that time, she has penalized Starbucks in the Netherlands and Anheuser-Busch InBev in Belgium. But Luxembourg has been a particular target: In 2015, she told the country to claw back about €30 million from a Fiat Chrysler unit, while a case considering Luxembourg’s treatment of McDonald’s is also continuing.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
“I don’t think that we’re done,” Ms. Vestager said on Wednesday, adding that new laws were also necessary. “The main part of the solution is of course that we have legislation that gives you a transparent tax landscape and enables national tax authorities to do their job.”
A broader overhaul may be afoot. The European Commission published proposals last month under which internet companies would be taxed in the countries where they generated revenue. Such a shift would mean the companies could not move their profits to jurisdictions with lower taxes.
A push in that direction could, however, prove complicated and carries several risks, said Clemens Fuest, the director of the Ifo Institute for Economic Research, a prominent think tank in Germany. In particular, European governments still might devise a host of new incentives to lure investment, while legislative changes at the European level could prompt retaliation by major trading partners.
“There are real dangers if Brussels keeps acting unilaterally,” Mr. Fuest said.
The European Union stepped up efforts to curb tax avoidance by companies and by individuals after the financial crisis, which forced many of the bloc’s member states to cut public services and raise tax rates. But opponents of the austerity programs argued that big corporations had not faced the same pressures, partly because they have long been able to shift their profits to low-tax countries.",fake

(Before It's News)
by Eric Stashin (aka The Rotoprofessor)
We all want to ignore the kicker… I mean really, we all don’t want to be bothered, do we? However as is the case with defenses every point matters and it would be a shame if your week went bad because of decision you chose to ignore. Let’s take a look at how things stand for the coming week:
Matt Bryant – Atlanta Falcons – vs. Buffalo Giorgio Tavecchio – Oakland Raiders – at Denver Ryan Succop – Tennessee Titans – at Houston Graham Gano – Carolina Panthers – at New England Matt Prater – Detroit Lions – at Minnesota Stephen Gostkowski – New England Patriots – vs. Carolina Will Lutz – New Orleans Saints – at Miami Greg Zuerlein – Los Angeles Rams – at Dallas Dan Bailey – Dallas Cowboys – vs. Los Angeles Rams Jason Myers – Jacksonville Jaguars – at New York Jets Jake Elliot – Philadelphia Eagles – at Los Angeles Chargers Brandon McManus – Denver Broncos – vs. Oakland Nick Folk – Tampa Bay Buccaneers – vs . New York Giants Blair Walsh – Seattle Seahawks – vs. Indianapolis Cody Parkey – Miami Dolphins – vs. New Orleans
Thoughts:
Stephen Gostkowski is generally viewed as one of the elite kickers in the game, and it’s fair. The problem is that New England isn’t settling for field goals thus far, as he’s gone just 5-for-5 over the first three weeks. Is there any reason to think that’s suddenly going to change? He’s still worth using, but he doesn’t necessarily have the upside of others who play for less dynamic offenses.
The Denver Broncos are one of two teams to allow three field goals of at least 50 yards this season. While Giorgio Tavecchio hasn’t had many opportunities over the past two weeks, he has the leg strength, is perfect thus far and will be kicking in the Denver thin air. That’s a nice combination.
Obviously after kicking a 61-yarder to win the game the Eagles’ Jake Elliot is going to garner a lot of attention. He has missed a kick in each of the past two weeks, though he’s getting opportunities (4-for-6 on field goals) and they are all coming from a solid distance (he’s hit two from 40-49 yards). He should be considered a solid low-end option thanks to the inaccuracy, and not a must use.

823,Regular Season OpenerBlackhawks vs Penguins10-1 Win Recap,"Regular Season OpenerBlackhawks vs Penguins10-1 Win Recap
(Before It's News)
After all the circus-like hoopla and festivities ended Thursday afternoon, there was still an actual game to be played against the Stanley Cup champion Pittsburgh Penguins. Quite a way for the Blackhawks to test out their newly revamped roster in front of their home crowd. The Pens were coming in on the rear end of a back-to-back, which saw them raise their cup banner the night before and waste a third period comeback and lose to the St. Louis Blues in overtime. Talk about a real kick in the groin. The Blues got to see what an actual Stanley Cup banner looks like up close, though, so they had that going for them. The Blackhawks, on the other hand, certainly didn’t go easy on the visiting Penguins in their home, and season, opener. In fact, they put on a real show for the United Center faithful. Not only did they put on a show during the game, but they really pulled at everyone’s heartstrings by surprising us all with a Bryan Bickell One More Shift celebration before this one.
The first period could not have possibly gone any better. The Blackhawks scoredgoals and chased the starting goalie before the Pens knew what hit them. Five goals on twenty one shots was the tally as the Hawks finished the first period of their season. What more really needs to be said? This was about as perfect a period as we could expect. It would not have been all that surprising to see the Hawks put up at least another goal or two, with the pressure they had.Officially, the Penguins had 12 shots on net, but I can not remember more than 7 or 8.
The Pens were able to get their only goal of the night, early in the second period, but the Blackhawks continued to steamroll over them with three more unanswered goals. The shots were even, at 14, but clearly the Blackhawks were in a zone.
The third period was just a formality, until the Pens pulled some meathead shenanigans in the waning moments. The Hawks did finally get to double digits, a franchise record for a season opener, which obviously didn’t sit well with the champs. Phil Kessel and useless big dummy Ryan Reaves earned late misconducts, as a result. Anyhow, One down, 81 more to go.
The Good
Just over six minutes into the game, with the Blackhawks buzzing the Pittsburgh net already, Patrick Kane set up Ryan Hartman with a fancy behind the back reverse pass that Hartman put into a wide open net. Antti Niemi was lost as to where the puck was, and was looking over the wrong shoulder. In his defense, they teach you to move to the other post once the player crosses the midpoint of the net. This one looked bad on Niemi at first glance but it was all defense, or lack thereof.
Moments later, Brandon Saad then gave the Blackhawks a 2-0 off a 2-on-1 with Richard Panik. It must be pointed out that the rush began when league golden boy Sidney Crosby left a drop pass for no one in the Hawks zone, and Saad took the puck the other way. No mention on the broadcast, though. How shocking.
Twenty eight seconds after the Saad goal, Nick Schmaltz jumped into the action and squeezed a backhand past Niemi, on the back door, after another fancy Patrick Kane setup. That was three goals in 1:13.
Less than two minutes after that third goal, Brandon Saad notched his second goal of the night off a terrible Antti Niemi rebound. Niemi was absolutely flailing through a sea of bodies while Saad bore down with most of the net wide open. That said, Niemi got NO help, either. Four goals on thirteen shots and Niemi didn’t make it ten minutes into the game before he was yanked. Supposed “ elite ” top 5 goalie according to NHL rankings, Matt Murray, did no better.
help, either. Four goals on thirteen shots and Niemi didn’t make it ten minutes into the game before he was yanked. Supposed “ ” top 5 goalie according to NHL rankings, Matt Murray, did no better. With three minutes left in the first period, Patrick Sharp scored his first goal back with the Blackhawks and their fifth of the game. I was very hesitant about having the old guy back but he looks good enough to be well worth $800,000.
After the Penguins ruined the shutout, it was Patrick Kane’s turn to actually score a goal, after setting up two in the first period. He rushed up the right side past Brian Dumoulin and roofed a short side backhand over Murray’s glove in highlight reel fashion.
Richard Panik was the next in the long line of Blackhawks to get his name in the goal column when Nick Schmaltz picked up a rebound to Matt Murray’s left and dished to Panik for a slam dunk.
Speaking of Nick Schmaltz, he was the recipient of the 8th goal of the night, his first, on a one timer from Patrick Kane in the second period. This assist was Kane’s 4th point of the game.
Five minutes into the third period, Brandon Saad completed the hat trick on a nice feed from Jonathan Toews. At least the crowd threw more than 8 hats on the ice this time.
The exclamation point, and tenth goal, was from Brent Seabrook late in the third period. He was, for some reason, down low in front of the Pittsburgh net and whacked a puck out of the air, past Matt Murray.
Brandon Saad, right? This kid is something really special and he is just in a zone. He already has two hat tricks, including his preseason one against Detroit, in only a handful of games back. Think he’s happy to be back? I sure am glad he is. Saad makes it much easier to stomach the loss of Artemi Panarin, for sure.
The “ improbable ” Dick Panik looked like he is just carrying his career best season right into this second full season with the Blackhawks. He looks stronger and more confident, if you can believe that.
” Dick Panik looked like he is just carrying his career best season right into this second full season with the Blackhawks. He looks stronger and more confident, if you can believe that. John Hayden continues to make plays happen. If he keep this up, he will force Quenneville to move him up the lineup, which is a wonderful problem to have.
It’ll be lost in all the craziness, but Corey Crawford pretty quietly had a great night. His break-a-way save in the second period on Evgeni Malkin was a prime example of how well he played. He saved 28 of 29 and was perfect at even strength.
I am not a big Jamal Mayers fan as an analyst but Adam Burish and Brian Campbell were pretty entertaining in the intermissions. Burish, especially, was pretty charismatic. We need to have these guys involved more, and less Konroyd/Mayers.
The Bad
The only real Pens highlight of the night came on a 5-on-3 advantage. When you have to face Crosby, Kessel and Malkin all on the ice together for a powerplay, there isn’t much you can do. Sid easily found Kessel on the back door which ruined the shutout for Corey Crawford.
When you score 10 goals, there usually isn’t much to complain about but the Hawks were 0-6 on the powerplay.
The Ugly
The Pens played former Blackhawk Antti Niemi in net and the Hawks shelled him. I remember a “supposed” expert once telling me what a good goalie Niemi was before his first season in Dallas, and how good the Stars would be with the Niemi/Lehtonen combo. He has since put up .905 and .872 save percentages, and had to basically beg for a backup job with the Pens.

1121,Pence exits NFL game after players kneel during anthem,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Mike Pence walked out of a National Football League game on Sunday after some players knelt during the national anthem, a form of demonstration that began last year in silent protest against police violence toward racial minorities.
Pence was attending a game in his home state of Indiana between the Indianapolis Colts and the San Francisco 49ers.
When the national anthem was played before the start of the game, some 49ers knelt while some Colts, their arms locked, wore black T-shirts with the words “We Will” on the front and “Stand for equality, justice, unity, respect, dialogue, opportunity” on the back.
“I left today’s Colts game because President Trump and I will not dignify any event that disrespects our soldiers, our Flag, or our National Anthem,” Pence said in a statement issued by the White House.
Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said after his team’s game on Sunday that he would bench players who disrespect the U.S. flag.
“If there is anything that is disrespectful to the flag then we will not play,” Jones told reporters.
Asked about Pence’s departure, Jones said: ”We cannot in the NFL in any way give the implication that we tolerate disrespecting the flag.
“I know the vice president did leave, because in his opinion the teams were,” he said, adding: “There is no question in my mind that the National Football League and the Dallas Cowboys are going to stand up for the flag.”
But the NFL Players Association in a statement defended players’ right to protest.

“We should not stifle these discussions and cannot allow our rights to become subservient to the very opinions our Constitution protects,” the association said, adding, in words that borrowed from the national anthem, “that is what makes us the land of the free and the home of the brave.”
After Pence’s departure, critics began to question whether he had only attended the game in order to make a production of leaving, pointing out he flew from Las Vegas on Saturday and was then going to fly to California on Sunday evening.
Pence had planned for “several weeks” to attend Sunday’s Colts game, where former quarterback Peyton Manning was being honored, an official in his office said, asking not to be named. Additionally, he made a last-minute decision to travel to Las Vegas for a prayer service on Saturday, the official said.

“As he had discussed with the president, when several 49ers players disrespected the flag and the national anthem, the vice president decided to leave the game,” the official said.
President Donald Trump said in a tweet on Sunday that he had asked Pence to leave the stadium “if any player kneeled, disrespecting our country.”
NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy declined to comment.
The First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution bars the government from limiting free speech, including prohibiting protests of the national anthem or punishing people who choose not to stand. The national anthem is played before every NFL football game and many other sporting events.
Less than an hour after issuing Pence’s statement, the White House released a picture of him and his wife at the stadium where the game took place, standing with hands over their hearts during the performance of the national anthem.
Trump’s criticism of the NFL players has played well with his conservative base while he grapples with controversies over Iran and North Korea, an investigation of Russian meddling in the 2016 election and policy struggles in Congress.

2549,Google has found Russian ads related to 2016 election,"Google has identified tens of thousands of dollars in ad buys by Russian accounts that used YouTube or Google advertising to try to spread misinformation and sow discord in American politics, sources familiar with the company's investigation told CNN.
These accounts used YouTube, Google search advertising, Gmail advertising and Google's DoubleClick ad platform to push divisive campaigns based on issues ranging from race to immigration to gun rights at times leading up to the 2016 election.
Google has not identified how many of the accounts and ads are associated with the Internet Research Agency, the Kremlin-linked troll farm that bought ads on Facebook and Twitter.Â
The company had previously said it had found no evidence of this kind of activity.
It is possible that many of the accounts are not tied to the IRA, and that the scope of Russian meddling extends beyond what Facebook and Twitter have identified so far.
Related: Facebook: Russian ads reached 10 million people
Google also has two different sets of policies for dealing with who can create accounts and who can buy advertising, making it harder for the company to police accounts that simply created YouTube pages without paying money to advertise or have those pages promoted.
In a statement, Google spokesperson Andrea Faville said the company has ""a set of strict ads policies including limits on political ad targeting and prohibitions on targeting based on race and religion.""
""We are taking a deeper look to investigate attempts to abuse our systems, working with researchers and other companies, and will provide assistance to ongoing inquiries,"" Faville said.
The Washington Post was the first to report Google's discovery.
Like Facebook and Twitter, Google and its parent company Alphabet have agreed to testify at public hearings before the Senate and House Intelligence Committees on November 1, sources at all three companies told CNN. Google will also meet privately with the Senate and House Intelligence Committees prior to next month's public hearing, a source at the company confirmed.
Facebook, which identified 470 accounts linked to the Internet Research Agency, has shared its findings with both Twitter and Google, sources at all three companies said. Using that data, Twitter found roughly 200 accounts linked to the IRA.
Google is the largest seller of advertising online, with more than 40% revenue share for digital advertising in the United States. YouTube, which Google owns, is the largest online video service in the world.
Separately Monday, Microsoft said it is investigating to see if any similar ads were run through its services.
""We take reports of misuse of our platform seriously. We are therefore investigating and if inappropriate activity is found, we will take steps to minimize such misuse in the future,"" a Microsoft spokesperson told CNN.

1374,Prince Harry Flashed A Satanic Hand Symbol Next To Melania Trump,"The truth is undeniable. Prince Harry and Melania Trump had their first public meeting over the weekend at the Invictus Games in Toronto Canada.
 
As is expected, Harry and Melania took several photos together and officially had a meeting that lasted around half an hour. However, it has now been revealed that something more sinister was afoot.
 
All across the internet, sharp-eyed sleuths were quick to point out that while taking pictures with the First Lady, Harry held his hands in an infamous and unmistakable pose – the sign of the horns. Official reports quickly tried to claim that he was simply unbuttoning his coat.
 
Prince Harry's unmistakable pose:

It all makes sense now, and perhaps nobody should be surprised
 
Harry did not create the Invictus Games just to support wounded army personnel and veterans. It is a convenient cover for his meetings with other major world leaders. He simply uses these Games to meet up with fellow members of the Illuminati so they can discuss how to best further their plans for world domination. It is common for Illuminati members to make such signs in public as a way to prove their loyalty to their superiors, confident that the average person will not notice.
 
The Huffington Post, unsurprisingly since they are part of the mainstream media, decided to throw some resources at this and ask experts what they believed the gesture meant.
 
They brought on Patti Wood, a body language expert, who claimed that Harry was most likely placing his hand on his tummy as an act of self-comfort.
 
“I’ve seen world leaders in photo shoots with Trump, and I see a lot of what are called self-comfort cues, ” she said. “This would be considered one of those. It looks like the devil’s horn, but it is also hand to belly. “At the very least it would be a comfort cue, and show a lot of tension and need to protect his central core.”

According to this explanation, the prince was probably a bit rattled is all. Others have tried to bolster this claim by stating that The Games was also his first time stepping out with Meghan Markle, which could reasonably lead to him feeling nervous. Throw in a First Lady, and it is a stressful situation.
 
Of course, the body language expert made a mistake by admitting that shes many world leaders make these cues when meeting with Trump and members of his family. Everybody knows that the Illuminati ultimately determine who holds power in the world, and so the Trumps must be a part of that. Although some in the skeptic community have hoped that Trump would be an anti-establishment candidate who would not listen to what anybody wanted him to do, it is clear that this is not the case. World leaders all over the world are publicly making Illuminati and Satanic signs with him and members of his family, and it is certainly no coincidence. This is merely the latest such incident. Even previous United States Presidents have made the symbol of British Loyalty, and it seems that nothing has changed.
 
The symbol is well known for being used by Satanists:

As the rebels consolidated control, a reporter asked Guevara what he planned to do now. “We are waiting for Fidel,” he said.

In the months and years that followed, Guevara oversaw executions at La Cabaña prison before becoming a top-level economic minister and diplomat, traveling the world to promote Cuba’s ideals.
Departure and Death
In October 1965, Fidel Castro confirmed the growing speculation: Guevara, an increasingly mysterious figure, had left Cuba. Castro read aloud a letter he said he had received from Guevara that said: “I feel I have completed the duty which the Cuban revolution gave me. I say farewell to you.”
He added, “Other nations require my services and I must leave you.”

Those nations included Congo, where a six-month revolutionary effort failed, and then Bolivia, where he found himself on the run from the country’s army, which was aided by the C.I.A.
After Guevara was captured and summarily killed, it took several days for something close to the truth to emerge. The Bolivian Army initially announced that he had died in a clash and that he had “admitted that he failed in the seven-month guerrilla campaign he organized in Bolivia,” an article on The Times’s front page said.
The next day, the nature of his death became clearer: “A medical report indicated today that Ernesto Che Guevara was slain at least 24 hours after his capture in the southeastern jungle on Sunday,” The Times reported.

Still shrouded in mystery, however, was the location of his body, which was buried secretly in a mass grave. (His hands were cut off and preserved in formaldehyde to prove his identity.)
A Second Burial
It was not until nearly 30 years later that Jon Lee Anderson, who was writing a biography of Guevara, learned of the location, and the revolutionary was given a second burial with full honors in Cuba.

On that occasion, in October 1997, Fidel Castro described him as “the paradigm of the revolutionary” who is “everywhere there is a just cause to defend,” The Times reported.

TORONTO — After the Maple Leafs chased Henrik Lundqvist in the first period, Tyler Bozak, Leo Komarov and Nazem Kadri scored third-period goals on Saturday night as the Maple Leafs held off the Rangers, 8-5.
It was an adventure in defending for both teams at times, with Toronto pulling ahead, 5-1, in the first period before the Rangers scored four straight goals to hush the crowd at Air Canada Centre.
Bozak ended the Maple Leafs’ slide to make it 6-5 at 7:17 of third, redirecting a pass from the corner from Jake Gardiner over the glove of Ondrej Pavelec, the Rangers’ backup goaltender.

By Rich Mitchell
Senator Susan Collins (R-ME) has come out in opposition to the current GOP health care bill making her the third Republican to do so and killing any hope for a fix this year.
Collins released a written statement saying that the Graham-Cassidy Healthcare Bill “is a moving target.”
“Today, we find out that there is now a fourth version of the Graham-Cassidy proposal, which is as deeply flawed as the previous iterations,” she said. “The fact that a new version of this bill was released the very week we are supposed to vote compounds the problem.”
The rushed approach comes as the fiscal year ends Saturday after which special budgetary rules will end that allow certain measures to pass with a simple majority. Republicans could only afford to lose two votes under the rules and Collins makes three.
John McCain (R-AZ) said he would vote against the bill, not because of content, but the process. He said he couldn’t support anything that didn’t go through regular order, long debate and garner some bi-partisan support.
Rand Paul (R-KY) said the bill didn’t go far enough to repeal Obamacare and he could not vote for it while block grants to the states were still included.
The time spent on Graham-Cassidy also used up valuable time that could have been used to push a part of tax reform through under the 50-vote rule. Now, any changes to the tax code will need 60 votes which will require some Democrats to vote yes.

222,Nowhere to Go but Up?,"Nowhere to Go but Up?
(Before It's News)
The players and coaches for the Baltimore Ravens didn’t mince words after the debacle in London.
They took full responsibility for the 44-7 loss to the Jaguars and were already thinking about the next game against Pittsburgh before their charter left Heathrow.
At the end of the day, Baltimore is still 2-1 and sits atop the AFC North with the Steelers. However, the stakes of their Week 4 matchup became higher with the loss to Jacksonville.
If the Ravens lose to Pittsburgh, they will be 2-2 with a road game looming against the Oakland Raiders and quarterback Derek Carr. who threw four touchdown passes against them last season. So, Ravens coach John Harbaugh was smart to quickly turn the page following the Jaguars game.
“We just have to get ready for next week,” Harbaugh said. “It’s just one loss. Doesn’t matter what the score ends up being. One loss or one win never defines a season. What defines a season is how you respond to the adversity that you face and that’s in football, that’s in life, that’s in anything. So we’ve got to work on the Pittsburgh Steelers. That’s how we respond.”
The key is the final part of that response.
How will the Ravens respond against their division rival with portions of their fanbase apparently miffed at players for taking a knee during the National Anthem in London? (That’s another story. So for now, let’s just focus on football.)
The Ravens will face an uphill battle if defensive tackle Brandon Williams remains out of the lineup with a foot injury. Without Williams clogging the middle, the Jaguars ran for 166 yards on 35 carries. His presence would be a huge boost against the Steelers and their dynamic running back Le’Veon Bell.
Baltimore’s secondary, however, was healthy and still struggled against Jacksonville. Quarterback Blake Bortles spent the first two weeks trying to keep his job until playing against the Ravens.
Bortles was 20 of 31 for 244 yards with four touchdowns. He threw to nine receivers, including three touchdown passes to tight end Marcedes Lewis. After the game, the Ravens’ secondary owned the poor performance. That was probably the only bright spot coming from this game.
“I can’t give you an excuse why we played so bad,” safety Eric Weddle said. “We just didn’t get it done, and I’ve never been the one to point fingers or give excuses. We just weren’t good enough. I wasn’t good enough. I’ve got to be better and that’s the way I look at it. Regardless of what everyone on the outside says, we’re going to stick together. We’re not going to point fingers or say this was the reason or this happened because of this.”
Despite the defensive struggles, the Ravens had more problems on offense. Quarterback Joe Flacco had the worst game of his career. He completed eight of 18 pass attempts for a career-worst 28 yards with two interceptions. He finished with a quarterback rating of 12.0.
Flacco could face more questions this week about the back injury that kept him out of training camp. The long flight across the Atlantic Ocean certainly couldn’t have helped.
Flacco chalked up the loss to Jacksonville as another learning experience and he is focused on getting better against Pittsburgh. A victory against their archival would exorcise any leftover demons from the fiasco at Wembley.
“We’re all going to get back in there together and make this thing happen,” Flacco said. “These losses can be lonely, but at the same time, we have a good team and we’re all going to go back in there and work on it together. That’s going to help us big-time.”

3285,How gerrymandering keeps Congress from passing gun control,"Washington (CNN) Two of the most complex issues in American politics -- gun control and gerrymandering -- are colliding this week in Washington.
The Sunday night shooting in Las Vegas that left 59 dead and hundreds more injured has restarted a debate over whether Congress should impose stricter gun laws, particularly around background checks for gun buyers and the sale of semi-automatic firearms.
But Democrats pushing for those laws have run into the same roadblocks that stymied former President Barack Obama in the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary shooting in 2012: The National Rifle Association's overwhelming influence in Republican strongholds.
That power comes largely as a result of the extreme partisan makeup of most of the nation's congressional districts: The primary is a more serious threat to most incumbents than the general election. And in Republican primaries, the NRA's endorsement and advertising dollars carry huge weight.
""It gives the NRA leadership an enormous outsized influence on these members,"" said Jason Kander, an Army National Guard veteran and the former Democratic Missouri secretary of state. ""They're more afraid of losing a primary than they are more people losing their lives.""
A major underpinning of the polarization of American politics over the last two decades has been the disappearance of ""swing seats."" The Cook Political Report's ""partisan voter index"" -- which measures how each congressional district performs at the congressional level compared to the nation as a whole -- scored 164 districts within five points of the average in 1997. But by this year, that number had dropped to 72 -- a 56% decline meaning that fewer than one-in-six House seats are naturally competitive.
District boundaries
That's where another issue -- gerrymandering, the use of partisanship in drawing the boundaries of congressional and state legislative districts -- comes in.
The Supreme Court heard a Wisconsin case Tuesday that could lead to new rules that would result in more competitive congressional maps.
Such a ruling, gun control advocates hope, would spur lawmakers of both parties representing those districts to court voters in the center, rather than playing to partisan extremes.
Some forms of gun control are overwhelmingly popular. This spring, the Pew Research Center found that 83% said they consider gun violence in the US a big problem -- including 50% who called it ""a very big problem."" Sixty-eight percent told Pew they favor a ban on assault-style weapons, while 64% favor banning high-capacity magazines that hold more than 10 rounds. Majorities also favor background checks for private and gun show sales.
The popularity of those measures doesn't matter, though, because majority Republicans in the House and Senate -- many from rural states where gun ownership and hunting is central to their culture and the NRA's membership is powerful -- are more threatened by competitive primaries, where the NRA's endorsement of a challenger who has opposed all forms of gun control would pose a grave threat.
""This is one of the few issues where gerrymandering plays a large role,"" said Jon Soltz, the chairman of VoteVets, a progressive group that backs Democratic veterans in House and Senate races.
Democrats' role
The inability of Congress to pass stricter gun laws isn't just because of Republicans.
In 2013, five Democrats, including North Dakota Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, sank a measure written by Sens. Joe Manchin, D-West Virginia, and Pat Toomey, R-Pennyslvania, to expand background checks.
Since then, Democrats have watched as President Donald Trump has risen to power in part by relying on the Republican base -- emphasizing issues like curbing immigration, limiting LGBT rights and more that energize that base and keep the party's congressional leaders on board with his agenda, even when those issues are unpopular with the broader electorate.
If Trump was a Democrat, ""He would attack the NRA, because that's what people are afraid of, and he would tie them to something that's anti-American, like the Confederacy or Russia. And he would do it very aggressively with his own voice,"" Soltz said.
Some Democrats have shed the caution with which they approached the 2013 gun control debate and are taking more aggressive stances.
Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy said Congress should ""get off its ass."" Massachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton refused to join Trump's moment of silence for Las Vegas victims, saying that ""it's time for action.""
The Progressive Change Campaign Committee said this week it would send fundraising emails to its list of 1 million members on behalf of politicians who demand stricter gun laws. PCCC co-founder Adam Green said in an email to the group's supporters that the effort is to ""reward those brave political leaders who go beyond kind thoughts and prayers -- and who demand action on guns.""
Republican response
But Republicans resisted those calls. Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin tweeted, ""to all those political opportunists who are seizing on the tragedy in Las Vegas to call for more gun regs...You can't regulate evil...""
Still, the House did opt to shelve a bill this week that would have loosened restrictions on purchasing gun silencers.
White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Monday it wasn't the time to talk gun control.
""I think that there will be, certainly, time for that policy discussion to take place. But that's not the place that we're in at this moment,"" she said.",fake

(Reuters) - Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) said on Tuesday it had received formal approval to start a C$500 million production unit in Canada and sought to quell talk that it had asked for special tax benefits for investing in its first such unit outside the United States.
The maker of Emmy-winning shows such as The Crown and Black Mirror said last month it was in talks with the Canadian government for an investment over a minimum of five years.
That decision was part of a broad review under Canadian Heritage Minister Melanie Joly, which included plans to modernize funding programs and review copyright, broadcasting and telecommunications legislation.
The government did not tax Netflix as some had proposed, opening the streaming service provider to criticism in Canada. (bit.ly/2wLo4Ma)
Netflix said on Tuesday its Canadian investment was approved under the Investment Canada Act, and that no tax deals were part of the approval to launch its new Canadian presence. But is also said it was not paying sales tax in line with existing Canadian laws.
""Netflix follows tax laws everywhere we operate. Under Canadian law, foreign online services like Netflix aren't required to collect and remit sales tax,"" said Corie Wright, Netflix's director of global public policy. (nflx.it/2yBTf11)

% of readers think this story is Fact. Add your two cents.
(Before It's News)
I see Wasps Ladies recently signed England internationals Amy Cokayne, Harriet Millar Mills and Justine Lucas, all of whom previously turned out for Lichfield Ladies.
What seems to be forgotten amidst all the justified hype and excitement surrounding the heady opening weeks of the Premier 15s – England’s new elite domestic rugby competition for women – is the fate of Lichfield Ladies.
A seemingly permanent fixture in the Women’s Premiership in England for several years (finishing in 3rd place last season), Lichfield have over the years developed many international players, including the three women mentioned above as well as current England skipper Sarah Hunter, Emily Scarratt, Natasha Hunt and Vicky Fleetwood.
Lichfield, however, failed to be included in the Premier 15s following an RFU tender process that effectively replaced them with Loughborough Lightning (Loughborough University) who, prior to this process, had never had a team in women’s league rugby.
As a result Lichfield has lost around 30 players, many of whom have had to move to top-flight clubs in order to be considered for international selection and several of whom have joined Loughborough.
I have read the judgment of the panel that dismissed Lichfield’s appeal against the RFU decision. Suffice it to say that the process was not exactly transparent and the judgment brushes over the fact that Nicky Ponsford, the RFU’s Head of Women’s Performance, was part of the decision making process.
Nicky Ponsford is an alumni and former coach of Loughborough University.
Just saying.

Jordy’s knee must have been pretty banged up; his absence shows the bench hole at middle infield, especially with J-Hay out.

Cole Train closing it out for the season (photo Pittsburgh Pirates)
Pitchers: Gerrit Cole (12-11, 4.23) and Stephen Strasburg (14-4, 2.68) are the gunslingers. It may be a meaningless game for the standings, but it’s tough not be juiced up over a Cole v Strasberg head-to-head. Gerrit is making his career-high 33rd start of the season and should break the 200 IP mark for the second time. It’s been a roller coaster season for Cole Train. He’s dropped his last two road games and has given up 31 home runs (amazingly, he had never given up more than 11 in a season until this year), which is one shy of the club record of 32 allowed by Murry Dickson in 1951. Cole is finishing up on a winning note, going 9-5 over his last 19 starts. He’s 3-1/2.56 in five career starts against the Nats and won a 6-1 decision in May in his only 2017 outing. The Nats are giving Stephen an extra day or two between starts to preserve his arm for the money games. Strasburg is still one of the elites with 10.5 K/nine, a 1.038 WHIP, and the rest of his peripherals equally shiny. He has a win over the Bucs this year, though it wasn’t one of his better outings (six IP, three ER), when he took an 8-4 count over Chad Kuhl.
Notes:
Starling Marte extended his hitting streak to nine games with a 2-for-4 performance last night.

Pete Mackanin will not return as Phils manager next year; he’s being kicked upstairs to serve as a special assistant to the GM.

1957,Smart Devices Are Snitching on Owners and Rewriting the Criminal Justice System,"By Nicholas West
A new type of court case is slowly but steadily emerging within the American legal system: alleged crimes being detected from data supplied by smart devices.
Several cases over the last few years have focused on data transmitted within the modern smart home, while a couple of others add an extra dimension of police completely reconstructing a crime scene based upon data collected from the home as well as the various Internet-connected devices that we wear.
The very nature of the 1st, 4th and 5th Amendments to the Constitution appears to be at stake.
In December of last year an Arkansas murder case made headlines not so much for the death itself, but how a suspect was brought into custody. James Bates hosted a party at his Bentonville home on the night of November 21st, 2015. At some point during the event a man drowned in a hot tub on the property. Bates claimed to have found the victim the next morning when he awoke, stating that it was a tragic accident, but Arkansas police obtained smart water meter readings that showed an anomaly between 1 a.m. and 3 a.m. Based solely on this data – and obtained without a warrant – Bates was arrested and charged with 1st degree murder.
Somewhat ironically, James Bates subsequently requested recordings from his Amazon Echo to defend himself against these charges, which resulted in Amazon waiving their standard privacy conditions.
A second case followed wherein we saw a police narrative emerge that a crime had been prevented by a home’s smart system. A domestic dispute resulted in Eduardo Barros allegedly wielding a firearm against his girlfriend and threatening to kill her. However, during the argument he exclaimed, “Did you call the sherrifs?” This activated a voice-controlled sound system in his home and dialed 911. After an hours-long standoff, the suspect was taken into custody and charged. Law enforcement was quick to hail the smart technology as having “saved a life.” But it was the presiding judge who shook privacy advocates by accepting the evidence regardless of how it was obtained, saying that there was indeed probable cause for the arrest without a warrant.
But it is the bizarre case of Richard Dabate, as recounted in the Chicago Tribune that offers up new complexities in the argument about how far police should be able to go in obtaining information and using it to investigate crimes.
Two days before Christmas, 2015, Connecticut police received a distress call from a man who claimed that an intruder killed his wife and tortured him. He was found in the home’s basement tied to a chair and bleeding. Richard told an apparently detailed story of the events that led up to the break-in, which included recounting how his smartphone alerted him to the intrusion while driving to work. He stated that he sent an e-mail to his company and gave the time of his arrival home at around 8:45 a.m. He says he entered the home and confronted the intruder. Meanwhile, his wife returned from a morning exercise class. Richard claims that he told his wife to run, but she was pursued and shot by the intruder, upon which the man dragged Richard to the basement, tied him to a chair and tortured him. The details of how he managed to dial 911 after fending off the attacker were even more dramatic: “Richard said he crawled upstairs with the chair still attached, activated the panic alarm, called 911 and collapsed. The firefighter found him soon after.”
During the course of the investigation, police realized that Richard’s wife Connie was wearing a Fitbit – a wearable device with a feature that tracks how many steps a person takes while exercising or going about their daily activities. The numbers didn’t match according to Richard’s account of what had happened, differing by a wide margin. Nor did the records from Richard’s smart key, which show that his alarm was activated at 8:50 a.m., then turned off at 8:59 p.m – from his basement. His email, which he claimed was sent from the road, actually showed that he sent it from his home IP address. Richard was arrested and now awaits judgment after pleading not guilty.
The Tribune noted one additional case where even a man’s pacemaker snitched him out to police. He claimed that he woke up to his house on fire, but after police summoned records of his cardiac rhythm, he was found to have been awake at the time the blaze began. He was arrested and charged for arson and insurance fraud.
The cases thus far seem to highlight instances where justice very well could have been served upon the guilty. Is this a sign that the American justice system is being diligent with the cases it pursues? Or is the precedent being set to drastically widen the scope in the future, opening the door for false arrests based upon faulty digital readings and/or hacks?
Ninety-nine percent of crime will now have a digital component … We have these little sensors all over. We’re wearing them and they’re in our homes. — Jonathan Rajewski, a digital forensics instructor at Champlain College in Vermont.

1368,Las Vegas Multiple Gunmen Seen From Hotel Guest Next Door Across The Way (Video),"(Before It's News)
 
 
 
 
 
An Australian man who was staying in the room next to the shooter in the Mandalay Bay has confirmed he witnessed multiple gunmen involved in the Las Vegas attack.
Emigrate While You Still Can! Learn More...
 
“There were multiple people dead and multiple shooters. I was just hiding waiting for police to come get us. I got outside safely and was hiding in bushes,” Brian Hodge told Australia’s Courier-Mail.
 
Mr. Hodge, who was staying in room 32134, next door to Stephen Paddock in room 32135, also provided important information when he revealed that a security guard was killed by police.
 
“My floor is a crime scene. They killed a security guard on my floor.”
 
Who was the “security guard” who was killed by police?
 
Wendy Miller from Cooroy, on the Sunshine Coast – another Australian caught up in the Las Vegas shooting – may have provided a missing piece of the puzzle. Also speaking to the Courier-Mail, Ms Miller said she was at a bar in the nearby Luxor Hotel with her husband when she saw what she described as a “man of interest” run by.
 
Ms Miller said the man sprinted through her hotel after coming off an escalator from the Mandalay Bay.
 
“The man that they [security] were chasing was wearing a security jacket like them,” she said.
 
Mr Hodge’s eyewitness report of multiple gunmen and a dead security guard, and with Ms Miller’s report of a security guard being chased by authorities, suggest that the mainstream media narrative of the “lone wolf” gunman is not the truth.
 
The fact is that this was an orchestrated, co-ordinated attack by multiple conspirators, and the mainstream media are attempting to cover it up.
 
Two explosive videos provided to Your News Wire have also confirmed there were multiple shooters involved in a co-ordinated attack, and the mainstream media of a “lone wolf” gunman operating without a motive is a lie.
 
Both videos show gunfire originating from the fourth floor of the Mandalay Bay Hotel, much lower than the 32nd floor, where the mainstream media is claiming Stephen Paddock, a “lone wolf”, fired on the crowd using an automatic weapon.
 
 
The mainstream media narrative regarding Paddock’s motives have also been debunked by FBI sources who reportedly claimed the shooter has links to Antifa as well as ISIS. But mainstream media is actively covering up the information, claiming Paddock had “no political or religious affiliations or interests.”
 
The fact is the Las Vegas shooting was clearly a co-ordinated false flag attack, orchestrated by Paddock as well as at least one other as yet unidentified gunman operating from the fourth floor of the hotel. The mass shooting and scores of dead will be used by the elite to further push their nefarious agenda.
 
Anybody who looks into the information available to them on the internet will arrive at the same conclusion. Unfortunately anybody who relies on mainstream media for their information will be force-fed a very different conclusion.
 
 
 
 
 
The questions must be asked: why is the mainstream media covering for a mass murderer? Why are they attempting to rewrite his past and erase his political affiliations?
 
The answers are simple. The corporate media, controlled by a small, elite oligarchy, is operating on behalf of the New World Order, attempting to mislead the public into believing their enemies are their friends, and their friends are their enemies.
 
It doesn’t suit the mainstream media’s agenda to have an Antifa member responsible for the worst mass shooting in American history. They are actively engaged in covering up this fact up so they can continue pushing the New World Order’s sick and twisted agenda.
 
Stephen Paddock, the Las Vegas shooter, was an Antifa member who carried out the worst mass shooting in American history in order to create further division in American society, push the country towards civil war, and further the agenda of the elites.
 
Official Antifa facebook page, Antifa Melbourne, congratulated Stephen Paddock after the bloodiest mass shooting in America’s history, before deleting the post after a torrent of criticism.
 
 
There is an active campaign to sow division and create chaos in the United States. Organized groups are working on behalf of global organizations with the most nefarious of goals. We need to wake up and stop believing everything fed to us by the mainstream media. They have proven themselves completely unreliable.
 
We need to stop hiding from the truth.

Do you think Brandon Saad was happy to return to Chicago? The 24-year-old winger scored a hat trick in his first preseason game of the 2017 NHL season returning to the Blackhawks after being acquired via a trade. Just days later, he did it again but this time in a game that counts. Saad played a big role in the Chicago Blackhawks blowout win over the defending Stanley Cup Champion Pittsburgh Penguins in the 2017 season opener. The Pittsburgh native capped off the night by scoring a hat trick in his first regular season game back with the Blackhawks

(Before It's News)
JEFFERSON AND TUCKER RESTRUCTURE CONTRACTS
On Saturday, Field Yates of EPSN reported that the Ravens had completed contract restructures with Safety Tony Jefferson and PK Justin Tucker. These restructures are the 3rd and 4th time the Ravens have restructured a contract since early August. Jefferson’s and Tucker’s restructures were preceded by CB Jimmy Smith in August and DT Brandon Williams less than 2 weeks ago as the team has dealt with a tight Salary Cap and an ever-growing list of injured players.
Jefferson ($3M) and Tucker ($2.8M) reduced their base salaries down to $775K each and had the balance of their base salaries (15/17th in this case, since the restructure was accomplished after Week 2 of the NFL season) turned into a Signing Bonus. The Signing Bonuses, $1,963,236 for Jefferson and $1,786,764 for Tucker, helped the team create an additional $2,663,603 in much-needed Cap space. Prior to the restructures, the Ravens only had a little over $1.4M in Salary Cap space.
The Ravens’ acute need for Cap space had been brought on by the continuing spate of injuries that have hit the team again this season. The Ravens are currently carrying 81 players on their Cap (53-man roster, 16 on IR, 10 on PS) after only the 3rd week of the season. That number is five more than the next closest team and 10 above the league average for IR’d players. As a comparison, the Ravens ended the 2016 season with “only” 80 players counting against the Cap.
They’ve now already surpassed that.
Jefferson’s restructure will add $490,809 to his Cap numbers in each of the 3 remaining years of his contract (2018-2020) and Tucker’s restructure will add 4595,588 to his Cap numbers in each of the 2 remaining years of his contract (2018-2019).
Taken separately, neither of these restructures are of great impact to the team’s future Cap and neither represents much of a risk of accumulating dead money, since it’s highly likely that both Jefferson and Tucker will finish out their present contracts with the team. However, taken in tandem with each other and with the 2 earlier restructures, the silver lining that was once a much rosier 2018 Cap picture is quickly eroding.
ARRINGTON RECEIVES INJURY PROTECTION BENEFIT
As has been explained in this space since the Spring, former Raven CB Kyle Arrington was entitled to, and would likely claim, the Injury Protection Benefit since he was still unable to be cleared from the concussion protocol after suffering a concussion in training camp last year. This benefit, which only started counting against a team’s Cap in 2016, allows veteran players who are unable to continue to play due to injury to basically receive a reduced amount for the season (or two) after they are released due to a career-ending injury.
This week, as expected, Arrington’s $1.05M Injury Protection Benefit hit the NFLPA’s Salary Cap reports. The team had surely already accounted for this, but the timing of its inclusion by the NFLPA just underscores how tight the team’s Cap had become prior to the recent restructures.
WEBB’S INCENTIVES
Last week, DB Lardarius Webb expressed surprise that he already had 2 interceptions and explained that he was not really expecting to see much playing time when he re-signed with the Ravens in April. At that time, the plan was for Webb to be a back-up Safety, with talented 2nd year CB Tavon Young, manning the slot Cornerback spot. But, injuries to Young and back-up Maurice Canady propelled Webb into the starting slot spot and much more playing time.
In fact, the 2 interceptions have already earned Webb some extra money via incentives and the greatly increased playing time will very likely make him some more. Webb’s new contract called for a modest $900K base salary (basically, the veteran minimum for a player with his time of service), but included up to $1.4M in incentives that could be earned if Webb met various statistical and playing time thresholds. One of those was interceptions, by which Webb would earn up to a maximum of $400K in incentives if he had 2 interceptions ($200K), 3 interceptions ($300K) or 4 or more interceptions ($400K). Webb’s deal also includes $500K worth of incentives for sacks, fumble recoveries, interception return yards, and punt return yards. Lastly, the deal includes $500K worth of incentives that are based on playing time (20%, 30%, 40%, 50%) with team statistical qualifiers. So, if the Ravens D increases its team ranking in either sacks or points allowed and Webb meets the playing time thresholds, Webb will earn the additional incentives.
At this point, through 3 games, Webb has played 70% of the defensive snaps and the Ravens have improved in the 2 team statistical rankings categories, so if the Webb stays healthy and his playing time stays pretty constant, he will earn the full $500K in playing time incentives.
All of these incentives are categorized as Not Likely to Be Earned Incentives (NLTBE) incentives and thus do not count against the 2017 Cap. However, all incentives that are earned by Webb this year will count as a debit against the team’s 2018 Cap. This, of course, will further erode the team’s 2018 Cap space.
PRESENT CAP SPACE
After the restructures, the Ravens are now $4.067M under the Salary Cap. Even with the crazy amount of injuries that have hit the team, that amount should be ample enough to survive the remainder of the season. If the Ravens have any of that left over, they will be able to carry that excess over into 2018.

2667,How a homemade tool helped North Korea's missile program,"SEOUL, (Reuters) - In 2009, a pop video from North Korea celebrated a new national hero - one that outside experts would later realize was at the heart of the secretive state’s banned nuclear and missile programs.
That hero, widely available in factories across the world, was the Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machine.
Big, grey and boxy, CNC machines use pre-programmed guides to produce intricate parts for everything from automobiles and mobile phones to furniture and clothes. They offer accuracy that human machine tool operators are unable to achieve.
In North Korea, thanks to a combination of homemade technology and reverse engineering, the machines now play a critical role in the weapons programs. They allow Kim Jong Un to build nuclear bombs and missiles without relying as heavily on outside technical aid or imports.
Nuclear weapons experts say this has helped him accelerate missile and nuclear testing despite international sanctions on the transfer of sensitive equipment.
Special Section: North Korea revealed.
Interactive: Nuclear North Korea
Interactive: Kim’s latest act of defiance
“North Korea’s centrifuges and new missiles all depend on components made with CNC machine tools,” said Jeffrey Lewis, head of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the Middlebury Institute of Strategic Studies at Monterey, California.
“(They) are the essential underlying technology for producing missiles and nuclear weapons,” said Lewis.
Since 1996, CNC machines have been included in the Wassenaar Arrangement – an international arms control regime aimed at stopping the proliferation of equipment with both civilian and military uses. North Korea is not a signatory.
The country’s celebrations of its CNC technology have been fulsome. Hundreds of dancers in luminous orange and green performed the CNC pop song, titled “Break through the cutting edge,” at a Korean Workers’ Party celebration in 2010. In 2012, the year the South Korean hit “Gangnam Style” was released, the North’s CNC title was on karaoke machines nationwide, according to Choson Exchange, a Singapore-based company that trains North Koreans in business skills. The official video for the song opens with a long-range North Korean rocket soaring into a blue sky.
CUTTING EDGE
North Korea likely started to develop its own CNC machines in the early 1990s as part of a drive to build sophisticated missiles and nuclear weapons, nuclear experts say. It probably learned how to make them by taking apart machines it had imported from the Soviet Union.
North Koreans perform during mass games in Pyongyang, August 2011. Choson Exchange/via REUTERS
Its first homemade CNC machine was introduced in 1995. Former leader Kim Jong Il gave the machine the “Ryonha” brand, according to a 2009 article in the country’s official newspaper, Rodong Sinmun. That was the first time state media mentioned the technology.
By 2009, the machines had become a mainstay of North Korean propaganda, as Pyongyang launched a nationwide campaign to boost domestic industry. Sanctions were mounting after its second nuclear test and a long-range missile launch that year.
At the time, arms control experts raised concerns about a visit by former leader Kim Jong Il to a North Korean factory where homemade CNC machines appeared to be producing aluminum tubes. These could be used for nuclear centrifuges.
“By around 2010, it seemed they were capable of manufacturing various types of CNC machines,” said Kim Heung-gwang, a North Korean defector who taught at Pyongyang’s Hamhung Computer Technology University before defecting to South Korea.
But it wasn’t until 2013 that the Korea Ryonha Machinery Joint Venture Corporation, which produced the machines, was blacklisted by the U.N. Security Council for supporting the weapons programs.
Slideshow (3 Images)
And it was only in August this year that U.S. intelligence officials told Reuters North Korea likely has the ability to produce its own missile engines themselves. (Full Story)
Now, Kim Heung-gwang estimates, North Korea has about 15,000 CNC machines. He bases this on North Korean state media reports and photos as well as interviews with more than a dozen defectors who were scientists, professors or factory workers.
MASS PRODUCTION
Pyongyang hailed the homemade machines as a triumph for its governing ideology of “Juche”, which champions self-sufficiency. But that wasn’t strictly true.
In August 2016, state media released photos of Kim Jong Un visiting a factory using CNC machines with the logo of Swiss engineering firm ABB ABB.UL, one of the leading players in the global CNC machine market. It’s not clear when or how the machine reached North Korea.
ABB said the firm respects all applicable trade sanctions against North Korea, and undertakes not to deliver ABB equipment to the country. “That said, we cannot rule out that some of our equipment may have been resold to DPR of Korea without our knowledge or permission,” the company said in response to a Reuters inquiry, using North Korea’s official title.
A United Nations panel monitoring sanctions on North Korea said in a report this year that Tengzhou Keyongda CNC Machine Tools Co of China had been a supplier of Pyongyang’s new CNC machines. A sales representative for Tengzhou Keyongda told Reuters the company stopped selling CNC machines to North Korea four years ago, and no longer maintains trade relations with the country.
Despite sanctions, CNC machines are commonplace across North Korean manufacturing and can be brought in through China and Russia, said Lee Choon-geun, a senior fellow at the Science and Technology Policy Institute in South Korea.
The biggest loophole has been that while some CNC machines are banned because they can have both military and civilian functions, most serve civilian industry. “Given their dual-use capability, you could even import the machines for other purposes, take them to pieces and use them however you want,” said Lee.
The CNC song highlights this in its opening line: “Whatever it is, once we put our mind to it, there’s a program to make it,” it says.",fake
1314,Las Vegas shooting: Paddock's girlfriend denies knowledge of attack,"Image copyright Reuters/Paddock family/CBS News Image caption US police have said the woman, a former casino employee, was living with Paddock in Nevada
The girlfriend of the Las Vegas gunman who shot dead 58 people on Sunday has said she had no idea what her ""kind, caring, quiet"" partner was planning.
Marilou Danley's comments came hours before police suggested Stephen Paddock had been living ""a secret life"".
They said he may have been planning to escape instead of shooting himself dead, but did not give further details.
It is not yet known why he opened fire on an open-air concert, committing the worst shooting in modern US history.
Clark County Sheriff Joseph Lombardo told a press conference that:
Police had found more explosives in Paddock's car at the hotel, along with about 1,600 rounds of ammunition
Paddock had been gambling just hours before he began shooting
He had booked into an apartment at the high-rise Ogden in downtown Las Vegas a week earlier during a different open-air festival where acts including Muse, Lorde and Blink-182 were due to play
But he said Paddock's motivations and whether there were any possible accomplices remained a mystery. The FBI's Aaron Rouse said so far no link to terrorism had been found but they would continue to ""look at all avenues"" without ""closing any doors"" because it was ""an ongoing investigation"".
""We don't understand it yet,"" Sheriff Lombardo told reporters, but questioned whether he could have accomplished his plan by himself.
""You've got to make the assumption he had to have some help at some point,"" he said.
Ms Danley, who spoke to the FBI on Wednesday, expressed shock at the ""horrible unspeakable acts of violence"" Paddock had committed.

Paddock ""never said anything to me or took any action"" which she understood as a warning of what was to come, she said in a statement read by her lawyer.
Ms Danley added: ""I loved him and hoped for a quiet future together.""
US authorities named Ms Danley a ""person of interest"" in their investigation and said they had made contact with her shortly after the shooting.
Ms Danley voluntarily flew back to Los Angeles from the Philippines on Tuesday night to speak to the FBI, just over two weeks after Paddock had surprised her with a ""cheap ticket"" to enable her to visit her family.
While there, he wired her $100,000 (£75,400), explaining it was to buy a house.
""I was grateful, but honestly I was worried it was a way for him to break up with me,"" she said. ""It never occurred to me in any way whatsoever that he was planning violence against anyone.""

Her sister earlier told Australian outlet 7News that Ms Danley ""was sent away... so that she will not be there to interfere with what he's planning"".
Paddock checked into a suite in the Mandalay Bay Hotel on 28 September, reportedly using some of Ms Danley's identity documents.
US President Donald Trump, who visited the city on Wednesday, said ""America is truly a nation in mourning"" in the wake of the mass killings.
Hundreds of people were injured in the attack.
President Trump praised the emergency services who battled to save as many as they could, despite the danger to themselves.

""When the worst of humanity strikes - and strike it did - the best of humanity responds,"" he said as he applauded injured officers.

Mr Trump said he was in the ""company of heroes"" after visiting the first responders.
""Words cannot describe the bravery that the whole world witnessed on Sunday night,"" he said. ""Americans defied death and hatred with love and with courage.""
Will the attack prompt more demand for gun control?
The shooting has prompted calls for reform to US gun laws.
But Mr Trump - who has been backed by the National Rifle Association, and spoke often of protecting gun rights during his campaign - has tried to steer clear of leaning too far either way.
After visiting Puerto Rico on Tuesday, he said ""perhaps that [time] will come"" for a debate.

481,Week 4 Rankings (2017): Top 50 Wide Receivers,"Week 4 Rankings (2017): Top 50 Wide Receivers
(Before It's News)
by Ray Kuhn
When it comes to wide receivers there is a lot to look at. Targets, actual on field production, the skill of the offense around them, game flow, and their defensive match-up are just some of the factors that need to be factored in. There is also a high degree of variability, as one play in either direction could swing the results on any given day. With that in mind let’s take a look at how our options rank for this week:
Antonio Brown – Pittsburgh Steelers – at Baltimore Odell Beckham – New York Giants – at Tampa Bay A.J. Green – Cincinnati Bengals – at Cleveland Jordy Nelson – Green Bay Packers – vs. Chicago Bears Keenan Allen – San Diego Chargers – vs. Philadelphia Michael Thomas – New Orleans Saints – at Miami Mike Evans – Tampa Bay Buccaneers – vs. New York Giants Julio Jones – Atlanta Falcons – vs. Buffalo DeAndre Hopkins – Houston Texans – vs. Tennesee Doug Baldwin – Seattle Seahawks – vs. Indianapolis Larry Fitzgerald – Arizona Cardinals – vs. San Francisco Brandin Cooks – New England Patriots – vs. Carolina Jarvis Landry – Miami Dolphins – vs. New Orleans Tyreek Hill – Kansas City Chiefs – vs. Washington Demaryius Thomas- Denver Broncos – vs. Oakland Dez Bryant – Dallas Cowboys – vs. LA Rams Stefon Diggs – Minnesota Vikings – vs. Detroit Golden Tate – Detroit Lions – at Minnesota Alshon Jeffrey – Philadephia Eagles – at LA Chargers Devante Parker – Miami Dolphins – vs. New Orleans Davante Adams – Green Bay Packers – vs. Chicago Sammy Watkins – Los Angeles Rams – at Dallas Rishard Matthews – Tennessee Titans – at Houston T.Y. Hilton – Indianapolis Colts – at Seattle Kelvin Benjamin – Carolina Panthers – at New England Amari Cooper – Oakland Raiders – at Denver Pierre Garcon – San Francisco 49ers – at Arizona Emmanuel Sanders – Denver Broncos – vs. Oakland Randall Cobb – Green Bay Packers – vs. Chicago Chris Hogan – New England Patriots – vs. Carolina Jamison Crowder – Washington Redskins – at Kansas City Adam Thielen – Minnesota Vikings – vs. Detroit Marquise Lee – Jacksonville Jaguars – at New York Jets Michael Crabtree – Oakland Raiders – at Denver Tyrell Williams – San Diego Chargers – vs. Philadelphia Terrelle Pryor – Washington Redskins – at Kansas City Martavis Bryant – Pittsburgh Steelers – at Baltimore Jeremy Maclin – Baltimore Ravens – vs. Pittsburgh Sterling Shepard – New York Giants – at Tampa Bay DeSean Jackson – Tampa Bay Buccaneers – vs. New York Giants Willie Snead – New Orleans Saints – at Miami Brandon Marshall – New York Giants – at Tampa Bay Jermaine Kearse – New York Jets – vs. Jacksonville Devin Funchess – Carolina Panthers – at New England J.J. Nelson – Arizona Cardinals – vs. San Francisco Allen Hurns – Jacksonville Jaguars – at New York Jets Kenny Golladay – Detroit Lions – at Minnesota Nelson Agholor – Philadelphia Eagles – at LA Chargers Mohamed Sanu – Atlanta Falcons – vs. Buffalo Jordan Matthews – Buffalo Bills – at Atlanta
Notes:
With the acquisition of Jay Cutler a greater emphasis was placed on DeVante Parker due to his big play ability. To start the season Jarvis Landry has been valuable, and I would expect to see that continue this week. Cutler has targeted Landry 26 times over the past two weeks, and the slot receiver has been a PPR machine. After catching 13 passes for 78 yards to begin the season, Landry had a down week against the Jets as he caught just six passes for 48 yards. While that is not going to win your league, it is still a solid floor. In Week 1 the Saints (Landry’s opponent) allowed 157 yards to Adam Thielen. who happens to be Landry’s counterpart. New Orleans also allows the 10th most points to opposing wide receivers, so it should be a good week for Landry owners.
It took three weeks, but Julio Jones is already nursing an injury. Currently it is a lower back injury we have to monitor, and while Atlanta is not concerned I wouldn’t be surprised to see him miss a day of practice this week. Jones had his best week of the season against Detroit with seven receptions, and so far this year he has 265 yards on 16 catches. What is holding Jones’ value back is that he has yet to find the end zone. As we enter Week 4 the problem is that Jones’ opponent (Buffalo) hasn’t allowed a receiving touchdown this year. By no means would I think about benching Jones, or not considering him a WR1, but he wouldn’t be my first choice when filling out my DFS lineup.
Last season DeAndre Hopkins was one of the bigger disappointments of the season, and with a rookie quarterback he wasn’t really on my radar all that much for this season. Houston has not wasted any time in looking Hopkins’ way so far this season, and in three games he has been targeted 37 times which he has turned that into 21 receptions, 204 yards and 1 TD. With DeShaun Watson eclipsing 300 yards passing yards last week, Houston’s offense isn’t a complete liability and that helps Hopkins’ value. This week you also have to like Watson’s match-up as he faces the Titans who have allowed five touchdowns and the fourth most points to opposing receivers so far.
One top receiver who doesn’t have as good of a match-up this week is Mike Evans. Evans has caught seven passes in each of his two games for a combined 160 yards and a touchdown, but this week he has to face a tough Giants’ defense. Last week New York held Philadelphia’s receivers to just 105 yards, and they have the fourth best defense against wide receivers in the league. This isn’t enough to keep me from playing Evans this week in every seasonal format, especially since he did pick up 67 receiving yards on Xavier Rhodes last week, but it is enough to downgrade him.
After missing the first three weeks of the season due to his suspension, Willie Snead returns to action this week. He is joining a New Orleans’ offense that seemed to show some life against Carolina last week, and the Saints get to face Miami and their scuffling defense. The sample size is small, just two weeks, but the Dolphins are in the bottom five of the league in net passing yards allowed. Last season Snead caught 72 passes for 895 yards and 4 TD, and I would expect him to jump right back into New Orleans’ offense, though you might want to exercise a little patience just in case it takes him a week to work off the rust.
One of the bigger disappointments so far this season is Terrelle Pryor. Pryor wasn’t a first or second round pick, but he was taken early enough that he began the season cemented into your starting lineup. Instead it has taken a little longer than expected for Pryor to develop chemistry with Kirk Cousins. After being targeted 11 times in Week 1, Pryor has four targets in each of the next two weeks, and overall he has 10 catches for 116 yards. While I ultimately think Pryor will regain his value, it might be better if he does it this week on the bench instead of in your starting lineup against the Chiefs.

3995,Harvey Weinstein scandal: What next for Hollywood?,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Harvey Weinstein has been thanked more often than God in Oscars acceptance speeches
Oscar-winning movie producer Harvey Weinstein is at the centre of a sexual harassment scandal, which has led to him being sacked by his own company.
Actress Meryl Streep - who once called him ""God"" in an awards speech - has spoken out against him, saying the claims left her ""appalled"".
Many others have now denounced him for the alleged behaviour, including Kate Winslet, Emma Watson, Leonardo DiCaprio, Benedict Cumberbatch and Charlize Theron.
When the claims were first reported in the New York Times, Weinstein apologised for causing ""a lot of pain"". He later disputed the article, however, claiming the report was ""saturated with false and defamatory statements"".
An article in The New Yorker later said that Weinstein had raped three women, which he denies.
Others including Angelina Jolie and Gwyneth Paltrow have now also spoken out, with Jolie saying she had a ""bad experience"" with Weinstein as a young actress, and Paltrow saying he had placed his hands on her and suggested massages in his bedroom.
It's a dramatic fall from grace for one of the movie industry's highest-profile producers, which could have wider implications for Hollywood itself.
Here are five pressing questions that arise from this mounting scandal.
What next for Harvey Weinstein?
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Might Weinstein be welcomed back into the Hollywood fold like Gibson was?
The man behind such hits as Pulp Fiction and Shakespeare in Love reportedly did not want to leave The Weinstein Company - but was fired anyway.
He was apologetic but bullish last week when the allegations were first published and threatened to sue the New York Times, the paper that broke the story.
Since then, he's been deserted by both his lawyer Lisa Bloom and his legal crisis adviser Lanny Davis.
And in his personal life, his wife Georgina Chapman has now left him.
It remains to be seen whether he will make good his threats of legal action.
Weinstein was made an honorary CBE by the Queen in 2004 for his contribution to the British film industry, and there have already been calls for that to be revoked. Prime Minister Theresa May has said she's ""concerned"" about the allegations, but any decision on his CBE would not lie with Downing Street.
Yet there is always the possibility he can bounce back, like other disgraced Hollywood figures who have returned to the limelight.
Mel Gibson, for example, was back on Hollywood's red carpets earlier this year, despite an anti-Semitic rant during a public meltdown 11 years ago - although the allegations against Weinstein put him in a different situation.
What next for Hollywood?
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Weinstein (centre) with the other Shakespeare in Love producers after it won best picture at the 1999 Oscars
Weinstein's firing comes after a number of high-profile men have left their jobs amid claims of sexual misconduct.
These include Roger Ailes, Bill O'Reilly and Eric Bolling at Fox News and Ain't It Cool News founder Harry Knowles. Bill Cosby is also facing a retrial over sexual assault charges.
O'Reilly said they were ""completely unfounded claims"" and Bolling described the claims against him as ""untrue and terribly unfair"". Knowles called the initial allegation ""100% untrue"" and later decided to ""step away"" from his role.
""Men in Hollywood need to change ASAP,"" said actress Rose McGowan in an interview with the Hollywood Reporter.
""Hollywood's power is dying because society has changed and grown, and yet Hollywood male behaviour has not. It is so not a good look.""
Jenni Konner, executive producer of the HBO series Girls, told the New York Times on Sunday: ""I see this as a tipping point.
""This is the moment we look back on and say, 'That's when it all started to change.'""
What next for The Weinstein Company?
Image copyright Rex/Shutterstock Image caption The King's Speech won four Oscars in 2011
Weinstein may have been fired but an internal investigation will still go ahead. The company said it had retained an independent law firm ""to undertake a thorough and independent investigation"".
This will be a financial burden on the company, with Forbes reporting such investigations can cost between $20m (£15m) and $40m (£30m) to carry out. Forbes also said the company would find it more expensive to raise funds in the future.
Weinstein and his brother Bob own 42% of the company, but it's unclear how profitable the company has been in recent years.
It had started to move into TV production, but without its most famous figurehead and driving force it is unclear what will happen to any deals it has signed.
One third of the company's all-male board resigned when the allegations emerged.
The Wrap has reported that the company is set to change its name in an attempt to move on after Weinstein's firing. The website claims the Weinstein name has been ""irretrievably tainted by the scandal"", although it says a decision has not been formally made.
What films does he have out this awards season?
Image copyright STX Image caption Elizabeth Olsen and Jeremy Renner co-star in Wind River
Weinstein is renowned for his campaigning skills, often managing to turn smaller, independent films into Oscar contenders.
A 2015 survey of nearly 1,400 Oscar acceptance speeches by the website Vocativ found that Weinstein was thanked more frequently than God.
One of his biggest hits was Shakespeare in Love, which won the best picture Oscar in 1999. A sequel has since been announced, with Weinstein as producer.
The Weinstein Company also distributed such films as The King's Speech, The English Patient and Chicago, all of which - like The Artist - won the best picture Oscar.
This year the company is pushing Wind River, a wintry thriller starring Jeremy Renner and Mary Elizabeth Olsen.
The Current War, produced by Weinstein and starring Benedict Cumberbatch as Thomas Edison, is also a possible awards contender, despite receiving mixed reviews. Will the Weinstein connection dent their chances?
What next for his political connections?
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Harvey Weinstein at the 2016 Bafta Film Awards in London
The Democratic National Committee (DNC) and several Democratic politicians have come out to say they will now channel Weinstein's political donations towards women's rights groups.
The producer was a prominent donor to the Democratic Party during the 2016 election campaign.
""The DNC will donate over $30,000 (£22,850) in contributions from Weinstein to Emily's List, Emerge America and Higher Heights,"" the committee said in a statement.
There are also question marks about his other donations and interests.
In a statement issued last week, after the allegations surfaced, Weinstein said: ""One year ago, I began organising a $5m [£3.8m] foundation to give scholarships to women directors at USC [University of Southern California School of Cinematic Arts].
""While this might seem coincidental, it has been in the works for a year.""
USC is understood to have said it is rejecting the donation.
Weinstein was a trustee of Bafta (British Academy of Film and Television Arts) in New York but his membership of the organisation has now been suspended, with immediate effect.
He was also on the board of directors at the US charity Robin Hood, which describes itself as ""New York City's largest poverty-fighting organisation"", but stepped down after the allegations emerged, the charity told BBC News.

2535,British spy boss says cyber security as important as fighting terrorism,"FILE PHOTO: A man types on a computer keyboard in front of the displayed cyber code in this illustration picture taken March 1, 2017. REUTERS/Kacper Pempel/Illustration/File Photo
LONDON (Reuters) - Protecting Britain from cyber crime is as important as defending it against terrorism, the head of Britain’s GCHQ spy agency said on Monday.
Britain has suffered a number of high-profile cyber attacks this year, including one in May on the state-run National Health Service which crippled some computer systems and caused huge disruption, and another on parliament in June.
Writing in the Daily Telegraph newspaper, Jeremy Fleming, said the speed of technological advances, whilst providing great opportunities for businesses, individuals and countries, was also giving enemies new means to threaten the nation’s security.
“If GCHQ is to continue to help keep the country safe, then protecting the digital homeland -- keeping our citizens safe and free online -- must become and remain as much part of our mission as our global intelligence reach and our round-the-clock efforts against terrorism.”
The National Cyber Security Centre, which is part of GCHQ, said last week it had dealt with almost 600 significant incidents which required a nationwide, coordinated response.
In July, Fleming’s predecessor at GCHQ, Robert Hannigan, said Russia was causing cyberspace mayhem and should face retaliation if it continued to undermine democratic institutions in the West.
Fleming said that Britons benefited greatly from the ease and speed of connections and from the security provided by default encryption.
“Hostile states, terrorists and criminals use those same features... to undermine our national security, attack our interests and, increasingly, commit crime,” he said.
Traditionally Britain’s security chiefs rarely spoke in public but increasingly the head of the three intelligence agencies -- GCHQ, MI5 and MI6 -- have become more open in explaining their work and countering criticism.

3391,Exclusive: Monsanto settles GM cotton dispute with three Indian seed firms,"FILE PHOTO: Monsanto logo is displayed on a screen where the stock is traded on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S. on May 9, 2016.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Three leading Indian cotton seed makers have settled an intellectual property dispute with Monsanto Co over its genetically modified (GM) seed technology, partly ending a legal tussle that has drawn in the Indian and U.S. governments.
Ajeet Seeds, Kaveri Seed Co Ltd and Ankur Seeds were among six Indian companies that delayed payments to Monsanto, demanding a cut in royalties they paid to the U.S. firm to license its technology.
“The arbitration proceedings with each of these (three) companies have concluded by way of consent orders which record the mutually discussed and accepted settlement terms,” Shilpa Divekar Nirula, CEO of Monsanto India, wrote in a letter to India’s farm minister last month, and seen by Reuters.
A ministry spokesman said he was not aware of the letter.
The dispute sparked a series of government actions that prompted the world's biggest seed company to withdraw from some businesses in India, one of the world's most important seed markets, Reuters revealed in a special report earlier this year. (reut.rs/2ncBknn)
Mahyco Monsanto Biotech (India) (MMB), a joint venture between Monsanto and local firm Mahyco, licenses a gene that produces its own pesticide to more than 45 local cotton seed companies in lieu of royalties and an upfront payment.
Acting on complaints by some local seed companies that MMB's royalties were too high, the farm ministry last year cut the fees these local firms paid to Missouri-based Monsanto. (reut.rs/2yf4qvA)
Since then, Monsanto - which is being bought by Germany’s Bayer for $66 billion - has been at loggerheads with the seed firms and India’s government over how much it can charge for its GM cotton seeds, costing it tens of millions of dollars in lost revenue a year.
BIGGER PICTURE
Ajeet Seeds and Ankur Seeds told Reuters on Wednesday they had resolved their differences with Monsanto. Calls to Kaveri Seeds’ CEO G.V. Bhaskar Rao were not answered.
“In the larger interest of Indian farmers and agriculture, we have settled our differences with Monsanto,” said M.G. Shembekar, managing director of Ankur Seeds.
“It’s business as usual” with Monsanto now, added Sameer Mulay, managing director of Ajeet Seeds.
Neither disclosed the terms of the resolution.
However, the Sept. 19 letter to Farm Minister Radha Mohan Singh said Monsanto has yet to settle with Sri Rama Agri Genetics, Amar Biotech and Nuziveedu Seeds Ltd (NSL), along with two NSL group companies, Prabhat Agri Biotech and Pravardhan Seeds.
“While we remain committed to amicable dialogue with any disputing party, and despite our numerous attempts to arrive at a closure, the outstanding disputes with a few companies ... continue,” Monsanto India’s Nirula wrote.
Monsanto says NSL, based in the southern city of Hyderabad, owes it more than $20 million in royalty payments.
M. Prabhakara Rao, NSL’s chairman and managing director, did not respond to requests seeking comment.
Earlier this year, citing a local law that excludes seeds from being patented, Rao told Reuters that Monsanto should never have been allowed to collect royalties after an initial payment to use its technology. Or, at the very least, he added, prices should have been set by the government.
New Delhi approved the first GM cotton seed trait in 2003 and an upgraded variety in 2006, helping transform India into the world’s top producer and second-largest exporter of the fibre.
“MMB has made several unsuccessful attempts to amicably resolve the bilateral dispute that resulted in such withholding of amounts payable under long-standing agreements,” said a Monsanto India spokesman. “Currently, these matters are pending arbitration in various legal forums.”",fake

673,"The ""Internet of Things"" Is Sending Us Back To The Middle Ages","Op-Ed by Joshua A.T. Fairfield Professor of Law, Washington and Lee University
Internet-enabled devices are so common, and so vulnerable, that hackers recently broke into a casino through its fish tank. The tank had internet-connected sensors measuring its temperature and cleanliness. The hackers got into the fish tank’s sensors and then to the computer used to control them, and from there to other parts of the casino’s network. The intruders were able to copy 10 gigabytes of data to somewhere in Finland.
By gazing into this fish tank, we can see the problem with “internet of things” devices: We don’t really control them. And it’s not always clear who does – though often software designers and advertisers are involved.
In my recent book, Owned: Property, Privacy and the New Digital Serfdom, I discuss what it means that our environment is seeded with more sensors than ever before. Our fish tanks, smart televisions, internet-enabled home thermostats, Fitbits and smartphones constantly gather information about us and our environment. That information is valuable not just for us but for people who want to sell us things. They ensure that internet-enabled devices are programmed to be quite eager to share information.
Take, for example, Roomba, the adorable robotic vacuum cleaner. Since 2015, the high-end models have created maps of its users’ homes, to more efficiently navigate through them while cleaning. But as Reuters and Gizmodo reported recently, Roomba’s manufacturer, iRobot, may plan to share those maps of the layouts of people’s private homes with its commercial partners.
Security and privacy breaches are built in
Like the Roomba, other smart devices can be programmed to share our private information with advertisers over back-channels of which we are not aware. In a case even more intimate than the Roomba business plan, a smartphone-controllable erotic massage device, called WeVibe, gathered information about how often, with what settings and at what times of day it was used. The WeVibe app sent that data back to its manufacturer – which agreed to pay a multi-million-dollar legal settlement when customers found out and objected to the invasion of privacy.
Those back-channels are also a serious security weakness. The computer manufacturer Lenovo, for instance, used to sell its computers with a program called “Superfish” preinstalled. The program was intended to allow Lenovo – or companies that paid it – to secretly insert targeted advertisements into the results of users’ web searches. The way it did so was downright dangerous: It hijacked web browsers’ traffic without the user’s knowledge – including web communications users thought were securely encrypted, like connections to banks and online stores for financial transactions.
The underlying problem is ownership
One key reason we don’t control our devices is that the companies that make them seem to think – and definitely act like – they still own them, even after we’ve bought them. A person may purchase a nice-looking box full of electronics that can function as a smartphone, the corporate argument goes, but they buy a license only to use the software inside. The companies say they still own the software, and because they own it, they can control it. It’s as if a car dealer sold a car, but claimed ownership of the motor.
This sort of arrangement is destroying the concept of basic property ownership. John Deere has already told farmers that they don’t really own their tractors but just license the software – so they can’t fix their own farm equipment or even take it to an independent repair shop. The farmers are objecting, but maybe some people are willing to let things slide when it comes to smartphones, which are often bought on a payment installment plan and traded in as soon as possible.
How long will it be before we realize they’re trying to apply the same rules to our smart homes, smart televisions in our living rooms and bedrooms, smart toilets and internet-enabled cars?
A return to feudalism?
The issue of who gets to control property has a long history. In the feudal system of medieval Europe, the king owned almost everything, and everyone else’s property rights depended on their relationship with the king. Peasants lived on land granted by the king to a local lord, and workers didn’t always even own the tools they used for farming or other trades like carpentry and blacksmithing.
Over the centuries, Western economies and legal systems evolved into our modern commercial arrangement: People and private companies often buy and sell items themselves and own land, tools and other objects outright. Apart from a few basic government rules like environmental protection and public health, ownership comes with no trailing strings attached.
This system means that a car company can’t stop me from painting my car a shocking shade of pink or from getting the oil changed at whatever repair shop I choose. I can even try to modify or fix my car myself. The same is true for my television, my farm equipment and my refrigerator.
Yet the expansion of the internet of things seems to be bringing us back to something like that old feudal model, where people didn’t own the items they used every day. In this 21st-century version, companies are using intellectual property law – intended to protect ideas – to control physical objects consumers think they own.
Intellectual property control
My phone is a Samsung Galaxy. Google controls the operating system and the Google Apps that make an Android smartphone work well. Google licenses them to Samsung, which makes its own modification to the Android interface, and sublicenses the right to use my own phone to me – or at least that is the argument that Google and Samsung make. Samsung cuts deals with lots of software providers which want to take my data for their own use.
But this model is flawed, in my view. We need the right to fix our own property. We need the right to kick invasive advertisers out of our devices. We need the ability to shut down the information back-channels to advertisers, not merely because we don’t love being spied on, but because those back doors are security risks, as the stories of Superfish and the hacked fish tank show. If we don’t have the right to control our own property, we don’t really own it. We are just digital peasants, using the things that we have bought and paid for at the whim of our digital lord.
Even though things look grim right now, there is hope. These problems quickly become public relations nightmares for the companies involved. And there is serious bipartisan support for right-to-repair bills that restore some powers of ownership to consumers.
Recent years have seen progress in reclaiming ownership from would-be digital barons. What is important is that we recognize and reject what these companies are trying to do, buy accordingly, vigorously exercise our rights to use, repair and modify our smart property, and support efforts to strengthen those rights. The idea of property is still powerful in our cultural imagination, and it won’t die easily. That gives us a window of opportunity. I hope we will take it.

3458,Swiss couple missing 75 years found frozen in Alps,"A Swiss couple who disappeared from their farm in the Alps during World War II have finally been found, 75 years later, mummified in a glacier.
 
 
Marcelin, 40, and Francine, 37, Dumoulin went missing on August 15, 1942, after leaving to milk their cows in a meadow near their home. They never returned to their family, including their six children.
 
A worker found the frozen bodies of a man and a woman last week during routine maintenance.
 
The corpses were preserved in the receding Tsanfleuron glacier, near a slew of trendy ski resorts at 2,600 meters (8,500 feet) above sea level.
 
 
“From afar, it looked like small rocks, but there were too many in the same place,” noted nearby Glacier 3000 resort director Bernhard Tschannen in an interview with Radio Television Swisse.
 
When he got closer, he noticed a collection of frozen accessories — backpacks, watches, mess kits, a glass bottle and boots — all of which dated back several decades.
 
Decked in World War II-era clothing, the duo was frozen close together. Their bodies have since been airlifted from the Alps.
 
The couple’s youngest daughter, 79-year-old Marceline Udry-Dumoulin, told Swiss paper Le Matin their children had never stopped looking for them.
 
“We spent our whole lives looking for them, without stopping. We thought that we could give them the funeral they deserved one day,” she said.
 
Another daughter, Monique Gautschy-Dumoulin, told Radio Television Swisse (RTS) her parents were walking to the valley the morning of their disappearance. It was a nice day, she says. Her father was singing.
 
 
But that was the last Monique would see of her parents, whose disappearance left her to care for her young sisters and brothers.
 
Their mother, a schoolteacher, and father, a shoemaker, likely fell into a crevice of the glacier, where their bodies were preserved.
 
The Institute of Forensic Medicine will seek to formally identify the bodies, through DNA tests, but the couple’s children are convinced they are their missing parents.
 
“I can say that after 75 years of waiting this news gives me a deep sense of calm,” Udry-Dumoulin said. “Now, I know where my parents are.”

200,China Open: Caroline Garcia beats world number one Simona Halep to take title,"Garcia has now won five titles on the WTA tour
France's Caroline Garcia beat new world number one Simona Halep to win the China Open and overtake Briton Johanna Konta in the race for Singapore.
Unseeded Garcia edged Romanian Halep 6-4 7-6 (7-3) for her second successive title after victory at the Wuhan Open.
She hit 17 winners and saved nine break points in the second set to move into the eighth and final qualifying spot for the tour finals.
Konta must now reach the final in Moscow to have a chance of overtaking.
Britain's Konta will play in the Kremlin Cup, which begins on 16 October, but Garcia has put herself in pole position with a hard-fought victory over Halep.
Halep moved to the top of the world rankings following her semi-final victory over Jelena Ostapenko on Saturday, and broke Garcia in the first game of the final.
But Garcia immediately broke back, before battling to take a tight first set.
Halep then wasted countless opportunities in the second before her final shot in the tie-break sailed well wide to hand Garcia the title.
Analysis
BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller
As a result of winning the title in Beijing - a week after winning the autumn's other big event in Wuhan - Caroline Garcia has now moved 185 points clear of Jo Konta in the eighth and final qualifying position for the WTA Finals in Singapore.
Konta is not playing this coming week, and although Garcia plays again (as the top seed in Tianjin, she has drawn wild card Maria Sharapova in the first round), the race will definitely go to the final week of the season.
Konta is due to play the Kremlin Cup in Moscow. Garcia is not currently entered, but is very likely to be offered a wildcard if she requests one.
Either way, Konta must now reach the Moscow final to have any chance of making her debut in Singapore. And remember, she has lost in the first round of her last four tournaments.
If not, she will be first alternate, so there is always the possibility she could still get into the draw if one of the top eight picks up a serious injury in the next two weeks.",fake
989,"10 Important Stories From 09/26/17 Box Scores: Montgomery’s Strong Start, Harper’s Return & More","10 Important Stories From 09/26/17 Box Scores: Montgomery’s Strong Start, Harper’s Return & More
(Before It's News)
by Ray Kuhn
We had a busy Tuesday across baseball as the 2017 winds down. Whether you are making that final push towards a championship, getting ready for next season, or getting those last few days of DFS in, we have you covered. Let’s take a look at some of the performances that stood out from last night:
1) Hernandez Shows off the Power…
September is all about young players taking advantage of their chance. The trade from Houston gave Teoscar Hernandez that chance, and he is working towards a 2018 role with the Blue Jays. Batting lead-off, Hernandez went deep twice. His first home run was a solo shot off Chris Sale, and then followed it up with a three run blast. The problem though, is that in his other three at bats, Hernandez struck out. In 73 at bats with Toronto this season, Hernandez has seven home runs and 18 RBI while batting .274. His BABIP is .317, and it is very possible he holds onto his role for next season.
2) Cutch Has a Game…
We are past the point now of wondering if Andrew McCutchen is truly done or not, but last night ensured he is ending the season strong. Not only did the outfielder go 4 for 4 on Tuesday, but he went deep twice. His two home runs, a grand slam and a three run shot, gave him 28 on the season, and all together, the outfielder picked up 8 RBI on the night. That leaves McCutchen with 87 RBI on the season along with a .278 batting average. Sure there will lots of younger, more exciting and potential filled options on draft day, and you have to keep McCutchen’s early season struggles in mind, but he still has something to offer.
3) Montgomery Has a Strong Outing…
If your streaming carousel brought you to Jordan Montgomery last night, then you should be pleased. The rookie picked up his ninth victory of the season at home against Tampa Bay with six strong innings. Montgomery held the Rays to just one run in six innings of work on six hits and a walk. He struck out five while bringing his ERA down to 3.96 for the season. The Yankees’ plan for Montgomery next season will likely depend on how their off-season goes, but I wouldn’t be surprised to see him back in their rotation on a full time basis. He could prove to be a valuable mid, or back end of the rotation option if that is the case.
4) Rosario Continues to Slug…
Everyone is going to talk about Byron Buxton and Miguel Sano (before he got hurt), but there are more young players on the Twins who do require your attention. One of those players, is Eddie Rosario. The outfielder has been having a solid year, but when Sano went down, Rosario truly has stepped up. He went deep in the first inning last night, and followed that up with three more hits. After picking up 27th home run of the season, Rosario doubled twice (33 overall) and drove in two more runs. That brought his RBI total up to 78 to go along with his .292 batting average.
5) What Will Happen With Hader Next Year…
We know that Josh Hader was, maybe even still is, a top pitching prospect. The Brewers have given him a chance to start at the Triple-A level, but for multiple reasons, the southpaw has struggled and produced ERA’s north of five. Part of that reason, is that Milwaukee’s Triple-A team is in Colorado Springs so elevation is certainly an issue. However, the Brewers brought Hader to the major leagues this season to work out of the bullpen, and all he has done in his 34 outings is dominate. Last night, Hader picked up his second victory of the season with 2.2 innings of two run ball. In fact, all things considered this was one of his worst outings since he gave up two runs, but he did strikeout six as he saw his ERA jump to 1.93. Hader clearly can pitch at the big league level and get batters out, so it wouldn’t surprise me to see Milwaukee try him as a starter this spring. If not, we know he has value out of the bullpen.
6) Maybin Drives in Three…
The Astros didn’t get Cameron Maybin to sit on the bench, and while hitting for average has been a struggle this season, he is still a productive option. After his two hit night on Tuesday, Maybin is hitting just .225 on the season, but his .270 BABIP (career mark of .316) says this is on the lower scale of what we can expect from him. Maybin’s pop was on display last night, as he hit a traditional home run, a three run shot, and also as he he a triple to dead center field and scored on an error. In 386 at bats this season, Maybin has 10 home runs 34 RBI, and 33 stolen bases. In other words, he gives you just enough to keep you hooked from a fantasy perspective on his tools.
7) Harper Returns…
As far as fantasy owners are considered, this is too little, too late. Bryce Harper isn’t back to give their fantasy teams a push in the final week of the season. Instead, Harper is back to get a few games and at bats in before the playoffs. The good thing though, is that we are going to get proof that Harper is healthy and recovered from his injury prior to next season. In reality, Harper’s injury looked worse than it was, but it was still a good thing to see the outfielder back on the field. In three at bats prior to being replaced, Harper went 0 for 2 with a walk and a strikeout. Check the lineup each day before starting him, as Washington will be careful.
8) Anderson Shuts Out Miami…
After struggling and missing a chunk of the season, Tyler Anderson is back, and last night showed why there was some buzz surrounding the southpaw this season. Now that outlook is always going to be clouded by the fact that Anderson does pitch at Coors Field, but early in his career, he has shown some potential. Last night, Anderson shut the Marlins out over seven innings of work while allowing just four hits and striking out five. On the season, Anderson’s ERA is 4.81 in 17 games (15 starts). Anderson made his fourth start since returning for the disabled list on Tuesday, and in that stretch, he has a 1.19 ERA along with a 0.79 WHIP. In two starts in Coors Field since his return, Anderson has thrown 13 shutout innings, and he is worth a look.
9) Another One for JD…
This is getting to be insane. Originally acquired to protect Paul Goldschmidt in the batting order, J.D. Martinez is taking control of things for Arizona’s offense. All Martinez did last night, was pick up three hits in four at bats. He was a triple short of the cycle, and Martinez’s night included his 44th home run of the season, which happened to be a grand slam. Martinez drove in six runs on the night which brought his total for the season to 103 as he raised his batting average to .304. Arizona certainly has agreed with Martinez, and it will be interesting to see where he ends up this off-season.
10) Seager Drives in Four…
It hasn’t been an easy September for the Dodgers as they came crashing back to earth. Corey Seager has battled an elbow injury, but it didn’t appear to impact him at the plate on Tuesday. The shortstop went deep for the 21st time this season, a three run shot, and he later added an RBI single (75 for the season). While Seager is having a solid season, some would consider his overall numbers a disappointment; although he is batting .295. It was a good sign to see Seager’s success last night, as he is hitting just .195 in 68 at bats so far in September. It is possible, that Seager might be a “value” pick for 2018 since he didn’t take as big a step forward as other young players; such as Francisco Lindor.

(Before It's News)
So who saw the Jets beating the Dolphins, Buffalo taking down Denver and the absolute beatdown Jacksonville just put on Baltimore across the pond? Sure wasn’t me. Just as unpredictable as the game itself, week 3 provided quite the list of major performances across the league: Stefon Diggs and Case Keenum dazzled against Tampa Bay, Chris Thompson made the most of his game against Oakland and in his first game of the season, Marcedes Lewis found the endzone in three times. If you managed to start all of these players last week, please show me your ways. In the meantime, let’s take a look at what Week 4 has in store for your fantasy matchups. Quarterback Fool me once, fool me twice with Cam Newton this season. After botching a prime matchup with the Saints, it’s safe to say the former NFL MVP is not quarterback he once was. He’s outside of my top 20 this week thanks to his early season performances. Meanwhile on the top half, the top four reign supreme again as they all enter the week with favorable matchups. Rodgers draws the Bears on Thursday night, and while Chicago got the best of the Green and Gold last time they played on a Thursday night, the Packers’ QB has thrown for 3+ touchdowns in four of their last six meetings. Past the top tier, the resurrection of Andy Dalton should continue this week against a bad Browns defense that just made Jacoby Brissett look like a pro bowler. Jay Cutler has his shot against the Saints. We’ll see if Newton was the outlier in regards to facing New Orleans.
Rank Name Team Opp 1 Tom Brady NE vs. CAR 2 Aaron Rodgers GB vs. CHI 3 Drew Brees NO at MIA 4 Matt Ryan ATL vs. BUF 5 Russell Wilson SEA vs. IND 6 Marcus Mariota TEN at HOU 7 Kirk Cousins WAS at KC 8 Philip Rivers LAC vs. PHI 9 Matthew Stafford DET at MIN 10 Dak Prescott DAL vs. LAR 11 Jameis Winston TB vs. NYG 12 Andy Dalton CIN at CLE 13 Ben Roethlisberger PIT at BAL 14 Carson Palmer ARI vs. SF 15 Derek Carr OAK at DEN 16 Trevor Siemian DEN vs. OAK 17 Alex Smith KC vs. WAS 18 Jay Cutler MIA vs. NO 19 Carson Wentz PHI at LAC 20 Tyrod Taylor BUF at ATL 21 Cam Newton CAR at NE 22 Deshaun Watson HOU vs. TEN 23 Jared Goff LAR at DAL 24 Eli Manning NYG at TB 25 Blake Bortles JAC at NYJ
Running Back I said it last week, I’ll say it again: all aboard the Kareem Hunt bandwagon! Hunt is well on his way to rookie of the year honors with no end in sight. The two right behind him in Elliott and Gurley are just as worthy of that #1 slot so you can’t go wrong among the top three here. Jordan Howard is the questionable play in the RB2 tier depending on how well his shoulder will do on short rest. Playing through the pain against Pittsburgh helped Chicago notch the victory, but at what price did it come? Yes, Mark Ingram looks to be the guy in New Orleans but I’m not sold just yet. It wouldn’t surprise me if Alvin Kamara works his way into the gameplan putting Ingram’s chances at fully breaking away from the pack on hold.

Wide Receiver The top three for this week got back to their dominant ways in Week 3 and should continue to do so this week. Considering what we mentioned above with the Browns making Jacoby Brissett look like a pro bowler, T.Y. Hilton reaped the benefits as should A.J. Green from Andy Dalton this week. DeVante Parker may be in for a huge week against the Saints. As the Jay we’ve all come to know and love, Parker’s QB has locked on to the young receiver early on this season providing plenty of opportunities. The 20s in this week’s rankings are chock full of opportunity between Tate, Cooper, Bryant and Hogan among others. It’s safe to say wide receiver is once again pulling away from the pack as the deepest position in the game yet again.

Tight End Kudos to every fantasy owner out there that avoided the Week 3 minefield at tight end. Gronk produced like we expected and Ertz put up yet another impressive stat line earning them 1-2 in this week’s rankings, but past that was a hot mess. Kelce, Walker, Rudolph, Witten and Bennett did not show as expected, add in the annual injuries to Jordan Reed and Tyler Eifert and you have yourself a crapshoot. Charles Clay is quietly emerging as a top option at the tight end position and should get his fair share of opportunities if Buffalo falls behind in Atlanta. Once again it’s looking like we’ll be playing the mystery game between Antonio Gates and Hunter Henry in Los Angeles. Avoid this situation as much as possible.

Defense/Special Teams Seattle returns home to a much needed matchup with the lowly Colts, they should produce accordingly, same goes for Jacksonville getting a matchup with New York fresh off their demolishing of Baltimore (although a jet lag concern does remain). Cincinnati has been lights out against the Browns in previous seasons and 2017 looks to be no different now that the offense has regained their stature. Looking at options past the top 12 this week, there aren’t too many enticing options. If you’re digging for a streaming D/ST, the Chargers will have the chance to take advantage of the Eagles’ vertical passing game that has been prone to mistakes early on, not to mention they just lost Darren Sproles for the season.

3671,Los Angeles exhibit explores rise of Tiki culture in America,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The rise of Tiki culture in 1950s America in the aftermath of World War Two is explored in a new exhibit that opened Friday in Los Angeles.
“The Art of Tiki” exhibition, at the La Luz de Jesus Gallery in the Los Angeles neighborhood of Los Feliz, is showcasing everything from Tiki-style furniture and totems to modern art, based on cultural artifacts from Polynesia and Melanesia.
“Some of the pieces have elements of sci-fi. Some pieces have elements of other mid-century that aren’t really Tiki but because they come from that same era, seem somehow familiar and they’re really good neighbors,” gallery director Matt Kennedy told Reuters.
For twenty years, Tiki items first brought over to the U.S. by American soldiers that served in the South Pacific, found their way into American houses until it was deemed culturally insensitive, Kennedy said. It re-emerged in pop culture through Tiki-themed bars.
The exhibition runs until Oct. 29.

1473,Joe Flacco Goes on the Defensive,"Joe Flacco Goes on the Defensive
(Before It's News)
Quarterback Joe Flacco didn’t remain cool when pressed about the Ravens’ struggles on offense.
Baltimore is looking to rebound from one of the worst performances in franchise history in a 44-7 loss to the Jackson Jaguars on Sunday. The Ravens are ranked 30th in the NFL in total offense (791 yards) and last in passing (364 yards).
Flacco adamantly defended his teammates as they prepare to play archrival Pittsburgh on Sunday at M&T Bank Stadium. The winner of that game will have sole possession of first place in the AFC North at the quarter point of the season.
“The bottom line is we need to play well at all times,” Flacco said. “That includes early and late. It is the full 60 minutes, and we preach that all the time. The thing that you preach is the basics. You can’t be out there in football as an offense and be thinking about 10 different things as an offense. You have to be thinking about the most basic things that you can go play physical and fast, which at the end of the day, is what you have to do to play football and play it well.”
Flacco has completed 42 of 69 pass attempts for 366 yards with three touchdowns and four interceptions. He is ranked 31st with a 65.2 passer rating, just ahead of Cleveland rookie DeShone Kizer (53.2).
The numbers, though, can be deceiving.
Flacco attempted just 17 passes in the opener against Cincinnati because the Ravens opened a big, early lead and stayed conservative. The following week against Cleveland, Flacco attempted 34 passes, but the Ravens also ran the ball 32 times.
The common denominator in those games was a victory.
However, the wheels fell off against Jacksonville.
Flacco had his worst game since being drafted in the first round out of Delaware. He completed eight of 18 pass attempts for a career-worst 28 yards with two interceptions. Flacco finished with a quarterback rating of 12.0.
However, he said that clunker of a game does not define the offense.
“That is how it always is, especially when you win two games,” Flacco said. “We did what we had to do. Then, all of a sudden, when you go back and you lose one game and you did not play well, now you just lump those first two games in with that game and act like we have not played well at all when it is not really the truth. We played terrible last game. But the first two weeks, we were standing up here saying how it was not statistically the best performances, but it was what we needed to do to win a football game, and that is what this is all about.
“I think we are getting ahead of ourselves when we all of a sudden say we haven’t played well for three weeks. We played terribly last week. There is no way around that, but the other two weeks, we did what we had to do to win football games. I do not think that is anything that we can hang our head over.”
Flacco and the rest of the offense can quiet the critics with a victory over the Steelers. If history is any indication, it won’t be easy for either team. Twelve of the past 18 matchups between have been decided by three points or fewer.
In 17 career games against Pittsburgh, Flacco is 9-8 with 20 touchdowns and nine interceptions. His quarterback rating is 84.7.
The Ravens lost a heartbreaker in their previous game against the Steelers, when Antonio Brown stretched the ball over the goal line for the game-winning score with just nine seconds remaining. The Steelers clinched the 2016 AFC North title with that victory.
Flacco said the team is not thinking about that play anymore. The focus has been entirely on the latest showdown.
“It should be an awesome atmosphere, and these guys have a good football team,” Flacco said. “It is going to be awesome. I love when guys haven’t experienced it before and they get to go out there and experience it. It is all good, it does not matter what happened. I don’t think that fuels it, just because there is already enough motivation for us to go out there and kick some butt.”

3350,A Farewell and Other Dramas at New York City Ballet,"The same program brought rare revivals of Peter Martins’s tiresome “The Red Violin” (2006), to John Corigliano’s violin concerto, and Jerome Robbins’s “In Memory Of…” (1985), to Berg’s. The eight “Red Violin” dancers all look mindless, the women all too ready to open their crotches to the audience as the men carry them around.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Maria Kowroski and Zachary Catazaro made debuts in the mysterious realm of “In Memory Of…,” which suggests life, death and transfiguration. Ms. Kowroski’s long-limbed loveliness made a clear impression, but as yet she lacks decisiveness. Mr. Catazaro always scores on sheer stage presence, as in “Swan Lake,” where his Prince Siegfried was another debut; standing, walking, gesturing, he commands attention. He remains a flawed dancer: long phrases of any complexity tax him visibly.
Three other Balanchine ballets returned last week: a triple bill of “Square Dance” (1957), “La Valse” (1951) and “Cortège Hongrois” (1973). Balanchine’s women still often seem the most free-willed in ballet: They keep taking the initiative, even when, as in “La Valse,” it leads to doom. In “Cortège,” which has been absent longer than the others, both Sara Mearns in the prima ballerina role and Georgina Pazcoguin leading the character corps were riveting. Though Ms. Pazcoguin is a soloist, she’s long registered as one of the company’s most memorable dancers; the blaze and drive she shows here are stunning.
Photo
Ms. Mearns’s dancing, as in “Swan Lake” in the first weeks, is more illustrious than ever, with thrillingly timed delivery that fills the theater. I’m awed. Yet, though I often find her the most sensational ballerina in America, I’ve been unmoved by her this season. She’s dancing with a torrential force that — despite her color, vehemence and precision — is in danger of overpowering her roles.
“Cortège” itself, though marred by costume excess, fascinates. (It returns both in the season’s final week and in early 2018.) At its frequent best, it’s one of the ultimate demonstrations of Balanchine’s love of theme-and-variations invention. As in Marius Petipa’s three-act “Raymonda” (1898), on which it is based, you see both the Hungarian folk material and how classical ballet absorbs it. And the supported adagio for eight couples, starting with a double-diamond geometry is one of Balanchine’s most wonderful demonstrations of multidirectionality. Nonetheless, there are sections when his love of revisionism seems unusually detached from the music.
Megan Fairchild and Anthony Huxley weren’t at their finest on Friday in “Square Dance.” But these are roles in which they’ve been admirable; I’m happy to assume they were thrown by a fire alarm that made them vacate the theater not long beforehand. The ballet itself exhilarates; the way it fuses the music of Vivaldi and Corelli with latter-day classical dance virtuosity crosses historical borders with exuberant imagination: the baroque is remade in modern American terms.
Photo
More than any other company, City Ballet has exemplified the union of music and dance— but here, despite generally high musical standards, there have been obvious problems between conductor and stage. If the “Swan Lake” music usually associated with Odile’s fouetté turns must be taken at so brisk a lick, can’t the step be rechoreographed? Most of the five Odiles I saw lagged behind the beat, turning with the most obviously anti-musical pulse all season. Subtler music-dance fissures have opened elsewhere. If they grow, they could shake the company from its foundations up.",fake
194,"In John Green’s ‘Turtles All the Way Down,’ a Teenager’s Mind Is at War With Itself","At the heart of “Turtles All the Way Down” is Aza Holmes, age 16, who suffers from terrible anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Her case sits on the icier, distant end of the spectrum. It is not easily managed.
Photo
People tend to associate O.C.D. with repetitive behaviors, and that’s partly true in Aza’s case: She has a wound on her finger, self-inflicted, that she continually reopens in order to drain and re-sanitize.
But her repetitive, intrusive thoughts are her true torment. She’s obsessed with — and repulsed by — the ecosystem of bacteria that seethes inside her, and the bacteria that live without. She can’t stop worrying about the rumble in her gut, or the breeding microbes therein, or the possibility of contracting an infection involving clostridium difficile, or the prospect of sweating, or not being able to stop sweating, or touching someone who is sweating. She has to fight off the insistent, unignorable urge to put hand sanitizer in her mouth. Sometimes the urge wins.

We spend long stretches inside Aza’s head, listening to these swift and unsteady thoughts. The rational part of her, the one that sees a therapist and fitfully takes medication, tries to talk herself down. But her mind is in the throes of a civil war.
“Please let me go,” Aza tells her unwanted thoughts at a particularly helpless moment. “I’ll do anything. I’ll stand down.”
If Green were writing in his usual register, he’d interrupt Aza’s descents into these cognitive spirals — or “light-swallowing wormholes,” as she once calls them — with a bit of humor. But he seems to have made a decision: If Aza can’t find relief, neither can we.

The first few chapters of “Turtles All the Way Down” are a little crude, a little awkward and a little slow to get off the ground — it’s as if Green needed extra time on the runway to overcome the weight of a success like “The Fault in Our Stars,” which became a touchstone for teenagers everywhere. (It has been rated 2,529,550 times on Goodreads, a number that continues to spin forward even as I type, like the odometer of a spaceship.) The premise: An Indianapolis billionaire has skipped town just before the police come to get him for bribery and fraud. A $100,000 reward is on offer to anyone who’s got the skinny on his whereabouts. Aza’s best friend, Daisy (the tornado), remembers that Aza knows this guy’s son. Wouldn’t he know something? And wouldn’t a hundred grand be grand?
Aza does know his son. She’d met him years ago at “Sad Camp,” a summer program for kids who’d lost one or both of their parents. Aza had lost her father; Davis, the billionaire’s son, lost his mother. Now it seems that both of his parents are gone.
So Aza reluctantly agrees to pay Davis a visit, and the novel — boom — begins in earnest. The two feel an ancient kinship, a bonding of broken souls. He’s terrified that his identity is inseparable from his money; she’s terrified that her identity is inseparable from her thoughts — aren’t people the sum of their thoughts? If they aren’t, what are they? “If you can’t pick what you do or think about,” she explains to him, “then maybe you aren’t really real, you know?”
A sweet, conventional love story begins. But it hits a bittersweet, unconventional dead end. Aza can’t kiss Davis without panicking. All those microbes. “I’m not gonna un-have this,” she miserably explains of her condition.
Still they bond. And Aza and Daisy try to solve the mystery of Davis’s father’s disappearance. At one point, Daisy gives Aza hell — doesn’t she see how her mental illness has made her self-absorbed? — and it’s awful. Then it isn’t. The friendships in Green’s novels are stirring and powerful. They’re one of the reasons we show up to read them.
“You are my favorite person,” Daisy tells Aza after they’ve reconciled. “I want to be buried next to you. We’ll have a shared tombstone.”
But the real question is: How does such a story end for Aza?
If an author has integrity, it should end plausibly. Green has integrity. He also has O.C.D. He’s tweeted about it; he’s discussed it on his famous video blog with his brother, Hank. Watch his entry from July 25 sometime.

I still wasn’t prepared for the ending of this novel. It’s so surprising and moving and true that I became completely unstrung, incapable of reading it to my husband without breaking down. One needn’t be suffering like Aza to identify with it. One need only be human. Everyone, at some point, knows what it’s like when the mind develops a mind of its own.",fake

Max Whitlock became the first British gymnast to retain a world title by taking gold in the pommel horse in Montreal.
The Olympic champion, 26, scored 15.441 to push Russia's David Belyavskiy into silver, with world all around champion Xiao Ruoteng of China taking bronze.
""I'm speechless to go out there and do it again this year,"" he told BBC Sport.
The medal is Whitlock's sixth at a World Championships and makes him GB's most decorated gymnast at that level.
""It's very, very special,"" he added. ""It's been quite a stressful build-up. It was cut tight, and me and Scott [Hann - Whitlock's coach] have worked so hard to get to this position today.

Whitlock was competing in his first competition final since the Rio Olympics last summer, where he won golds in pommel and floor, as well as all around bronze.
In Montreal he chose to focus on his two gold medal apparatus, missing the floor final but qualifying top for pommel.
His winning score was a tenth of a point higher than in qualifying thanks to a last-minute change of routine to give him a higher difficulty value.
""I just tried to put that [pressure of trying to defend a world title] to one side, try and focus on what I do, like I always do, focus on my job, and my job was to go there today and perform as good as I possibly can. That is what sport's all about,"" he added.

3021,Chicago Blackhawks defeat the salary cap menace,"Chicago Blackhawks defeat the salary cap menace
(Before It's News)
The NHL has made the decision to allow the Chicago Blackhawks to place Marian Hossa on long-term injured reserve. The 12-year contract that Hossa signed with the Blackhawks became a problem when the 2013 CBA attached a salary cap recapture penalty to his contract. The 2013 CBA wanted to punish teams that circumvented the salary cap by signing long deals such as Hossa’s 12-year, $63 million deal. If Hossa retired this year the Blackhawks would be hit with a $4.275 million penalty over the next 4 years. The 2013 CBA essentially backed the Blackhawks into a corner with Hossa and the only realistic way around it is placing him on long-term injured reserve. It turns out Hossa has been dealing with a skin condition that was starting to affect his health and playing ability. Now the Blackhawks can avoid cap recapture penalties by placing Hossa on LTIR. I’ll make it clear that the last thing the Blackhawks want to do is play a full season without Hossa, he’s a player that is near impossible to replace. The only good thing about Hossa hitting LTIR is the Blackhawks will finally be able to escape a suffocating salary cap.
This is how the Blackhawks will become salary cap compliant:
Tootoo and Rozsival will be placed on the season-opening LTIR to bring cap overages down to $0. The Blackhawks will put forth a league minimum, salary cap compliant roster. Hossa will be placed on LTIR and the Blackhawks will free up roughly $3 million in cap space.
Now the Blackhawks will have the flexibility to add Alex DeBrincat and Gustav Forsling back to the roster and sign Cody Franson. Franson’s deal is reported to be 1 year, $1 million. At the expense of Marian Hossa’s career, the Blackhawks will have some cap space to work with. This is a problem that the NHL shouldn’t have let happen and it’s something other teams will have to deal with until the NHL fixes it.

1921,"Donald Trump Threatens North Korea On Twitter, NK Foreign Minister Responds ""You Declared War""","By Aaron Kesel
Tensions are rising at a quickening rate between the United States and North Korea as for weeks U.S. president Donald Trump and North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un have exchanged insults, but things are heating up as the world gears for conflict. On Monday, North Korea’s foreign minister Ri Yong Ho accused President Donald Trump of declaring war, adding the country now has the right to shoot down U.S. strategic bombers even when they are not inside the country’s airspace, The Guardian reported.
“The whole world should clearly remember it was the U.S. who first declared war on our country,” Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said. “Since the United States declared war on our country, we will have every right to make countermeasures, including the right to shoot down United States strategic bombers even when they are not inside the airspace border of our country,” he added.
This comes after U.S. president Donald Trump’s tirade at the UN where he essentially declared war on North Korea and Iran as he flung around harsh rhetoric threatening both nations. The U.S. will have “no choice but to totally destroy North Korea if it is forced to defend itself or its allies,” Trump said at the UN.
Trump then took to Twitter on Saturday night after a coordinated joint military drill with Japan flying B-1B bombers from Guam and F-15 fighter escorts from Okinawa, over the waters of North Korea.
The North Korean regime “won’t be around much longer” if Ri “echoes thoughts” of dictator Kim Jong-un, whom Trump has nicknamed “Little Rocket Man,” POTUS tweeted.
Just heard Foreign Minister of North Korea speak at U.N. If he echoes thoughts of Little Rocket Man, they won’t be around much longer! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2017
Ri called Trump “President Evil” and claimed that economic sanctions will not deter Pyongyang’s pursuit of nuclear weapons and a “balance of power with the U.S.”
Ri said on Monday, the UN and the international community had hoped that the exchange of rhetoric between the two countries would not turn into “real action.”
“However, last weekend Trump claimed that our leadership won’t be around much longer, and hence, at last, he declared war on our country,” Ri said. Adding: “Given the fact that this came from someone who holds the seat of the US presidency, this is clearly a declaration of war,” Ri said.
The U.S. denies it has declared war but warned it had military options if North Korea takes further “provocative” actions.
“Frankly, the suggestion of that is absurd,” White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said. “Our goal is still the same: we continue to seek the peaceful denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,” she said. “That’s our focus – doing that through both the most maximum economic and diplomatic pressures as possible at this point.”
Meanwhile, the Pentagon stated it had the right to fly aircraft off the North Korean coast and would continue doing so. Col Robert Manning, a Defense Department spokesman said that the U.S. had weighed military options in confronting the threat of North Korea.
Wire Tapped America - New Free Book (Ad) “If North Korea does not stop their provocative actions … we will make sure that we provide options to the president to deal with North Korea,” Manning said.
The PBoC (People’s Bank of China) central bank of China — North Korea’s only major ally — has also told its banks to “strictly implement the U.N. sanctions” as a move to stop the development of its nuclear weapon program.
According to Reuters via RIA news agency, Russia is reportedly working behind the scenes to resolve the diplomatic crisis with a political solution between the two nations. Russia is warning that a conflict on the Korean peninsula would have “catastrophic consequences” for the world as a whole.
Last week U.S. Secretary Of Defense threatened the potential use of “kinetic weapons” on the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) if things continue; this came before the flyover of North Korea after the U.S. and South Korea’s annual harass-the-dictatorship Ulchi-Freedom Guardian drills. With a single tweet, the president of the United States could start a war, someone needs to take Twitter away from Trump if it’s not clear by now it’s an absolute national security risk.

999,"Israel’s Foreign Agents Don’t Register, Why Should Russia’s?","By Grant Smith
Can Russia Use Israel Lobby Tactics To Skirt FARA Order?
The Department of Justice has ordered Russia’s U.S.-based RT news network to begin registering as Russian foreign agents under the 1938 Foreign Agents Registration Act. The law requires US-based agents of foreign principals to disclose financial information and activities in regular public filings overseen by a designated DOJ office. Over the years FARA has been amended to exclude bona fide news organizations. The Department of Justice order breaks a long period of unfettered access to the U.S. by foreign press agencies, many directly and indirectly financed by foreign governments.
Although RTs viewership in the United States is minuscule compared to major domestic broadcast and cable news outlets, over the years RT has made many enemies in Washington. The network’s slogan, “Question More,” and financial resources allowed it to televise stories that US networks, under the perpetual threat of loss of “access” to newsmakers, boycotts and organized pressure campaigns, cannot. Nowhere was this more evident than RT’s relentless coverage of Israel and its US lobby. RT covered Benjamin Netanyahu’s connection to the Arnon Milchan nuclear trigger smuggling ring, the diversion of weapons grade uranium from a toxic plant in Pennsylvania to Israel, and details of a massive Israeli-lobby orchestrated propaganda campaign in the United States. A FARA order could mean RT’s departure from the American scene. This could reduce the number of news packages on topics prohibited in America – located in the triple-digit channel nether-region of the cable lineup, but archived and well-viewed online with 2.2 million YouTube subscribers – to zero.
With new scrutiny of Russian activities following allegations of meddling in the U.S. electoral process, the FARA order should come as no surprise. The Department of Justice can be expected to deploy resources far in excess of the meager 9-person team working in the FARA department in order to finally “get Russia.” However, RT could attempt to use the tactics of another FARA target – the Israel lobby – to avoid registering.
Delay, delay, delay The American Zionist Council (and AIPAC, which was AZC’s unincorporated lobbying committee) were ordered by the Kennedy administration to register in 1962. This followed a massive propaganda campaign targeting congress and the American public funded with foreign money aimed at winning unconditional foreign aid and diplomatic support for Israel. AZC strung along the Department of Justice until 1965, long enough to orchestrate a paper “restructuring” of its operations that led to the incorporation of AIPAC as a separate entity. Politically pressure DOJ and political elites into a special exemption Whether trying to avoid an espionage prosecution (like the Anti-Defamation League) or ignoring seven separate orders to register under FARA (like the Zionist Organization of America), sometimes it takes a visit with the Attorney General himself (or in the case of Janet Reno, herself). ZOA was ordered to register in 1938 as a subsidiary and “subject to the direction” of the World Zionist Organization. Like AIPAC, it strung along the enforcement process, in its case until 1960. The registration effort was serious. An internal DOJ memo ten years into the lengthy effort noted, “…if ZOA is to be exempted from registration, DOJ might as well forget its entire campaign…” However, Justice Department employees began detecting political push-back, (PDF) “..the pressure was on somewhere in the government… it would be unwise to do anything further…under the circumstances do not desire for the moment to write to the Zionist Organization of America…” Multiple Israel affinity organizations ordered to register simultaneously refused to comply with FARA orders, citing a “certain high official in the Department of Justice” had assured them that (PDF) “the Department would not require any Zionist group to register and need not fear prosecution.” Clarify that Russia is not the Soviet Union Early in the drive to register AZC/AIPAC as foreign agents, their lead lawyer made an appeal for “prosecutorial discretion.” Maurice Boukstein argued that the 1938 Foreign Agents Registration Act had been crafted to target and expose Nazi and Soviet propaganda efforts in the United States. “While the language, of course, comprehends everybody,” lobbying for Israel should not be treated the same, he argued. RT, like advocates coordinating with and on behalf of Israel, could similarly argue that the Soviet Union is dead and gone, and that Russia now only wants to be friends. Reconstitute The Jewish Agency’s American Section, which had funneled millions of foreign funds into AZC/AIPAC, faced a FARA order that seemed unbeatable. The Jewish Agency’s direct ties to the Israeli government and Knesset were exposed in 1969 when the Jewish Agency was ordered by the DOJ to file its secret 1953 covenant agreement. After a 1970 Justice Department review, the American Section of the Jewish Agency filed its final FARA disclosure in 1971. It then “reemerged” three months later, claiming to be the American Section of the World Zionist Organization, an entity with no Israeli government covenant. The Department of Justice, noting that the physical address, leadership, staff, and functions of the “new” entity had not changed, labeled the reconstitution “sketchy,” but did nothing. Meanwhile, overseas, the Jewish Agency continued to funnel support to its US agents. Dennis Ross served as Chairman of the Jewish Agency’s “Jewish People Planning Institute” in Jerusalem until entering the Obama administration to head-up the fatally flawed “peace process” in 2009. Volunteer to spy for the CIA and FBI In the 1940s and 1950s the Jewish Telegraphic Agency came under heavy scrutiny to file as a foreign agent by the FBI and Department of Justice. An internal 1950s DOJ report found that, “The Israeli Government, which is seriously short of dollar credits, is supposed to be underwriting the operations of JTA to the extent of $5,000 per month…” The JTA was never ordered to register, and it is unclear whether it was JTA’s intense efforts to ingratiate itself with the FBI that finally provided the leniency it needed. In 1942 the head of JTA proposed the FBI pay $540 per month to leverage JTA’s network of correspondents in Latin America as an intelligence gathering service. To bolster the appeal of the offer, the proposal noted that the OSS (predecessor of the CIA) was already paying $300 per month for similar services. In 1950 JTA’s Milton Friedman volunteered to spy on the Soviet Union using his JTA press credential as non-official cover. JTA also offered to spy on Ukrainians residing in the United States.
Ultimately, RT may find it does not have the required number of sympathizers inside and outside the US government, the requisite moral character, or enough money to pull off such FARA avoidance shenanigans. However, the RT FARA order may reignite broader American interest in the selectivity with which FARA is enforced. The key question has long been, “if Israel’s foreign agents working tirelessly to influence the government and public opinion aren’t registering, why should anyone?”
Grant F. Smith is the author of the 2008 book, newly released on Kindle, America’s Defense Line: The Justice Department’s Battle to Register the Israel Lobby as Agents of a Foreign Government. He is the director of the Institute for Research: Middle Eastern Policy in Washington, D.C.

1394,'I wish they could be saved': The victims of India's poisonous dust,"Image copyright Ashish V Image caption At the age of 17, Urmila Yadav became one of the youngest certified cases of silicosis in India
On a recent summer morning, Urmila Yadav set off for the main temple in the village of Budhpura, located in India's north-western state of Rajasthan, where a community meeting was taking place.
She hesitated as she entered the courtyard filled with women of different ages. All of their husbands had died while working in the mines as they succumbed to silicosis, an incurable lung disease.
Silicosis, which kills thousands around the world, is caused by inhaling silica dust found in rock, sand, quartz and many building materials.
It can lead to breathing difficulties, regular coughing, chest pains and, sometimes, tuberculosis and other chest infections.
The widows had decided to stage a protest in the main town of Bundi, where the state's chief minister, Vasundhara Raje, was visiting.
As Urmila entered, the widows were preparing slogans and banners demanding pensions and compensation. ""There she is. Come, come,"" a few women cried out.
Feeling a little overwhelmed by the crowd, the 19-year-old smiled shyly and sat on the ground. As those around her shared their stories of despair, she kept her head down and nervously started to fold and tuck her long scarf.
When it was her turn to speak, Ram Chandra, an elderly man diagnosed with silicosis, addressed the gathering instead. ""Our daughter, as you know, suffers from silicosis.""
Two years ago, at the age of 17, Urmila became one of the youngest certified cases of silicosis in India.
Her case is singular, even in this village where mining and quarry work is the only occupation and silicosis is a commonplace disease that strikes almost every family, it is mostly men who are affected.
Image copyright Ashish V Image caption For children diagnosed with silicosis, it is likely due to either living near or working in the mines - both of which are illegal
Rajasthan, which has the highest number of mining leases, has been the epicentre of silicosis in India.
The number of silicosis certified patients in Rajasthan, according to government data, is 8441 (the figures are available up to April 2017). Actual numbers are likely to be much higher, claim advocacy groups.
It is the only state to have a monetary relief mechanism for certified patients, in place since 2013, but the onus is on workers to get a diagnosis and prove their occupational history, which is challenging in an unregulated industry like mining in India.
More men than women are vulnerable to the disease, because of higher exposure over a period of time. The National Human Rights Commission of India calculates the average age of onset of silicosis at 27 years.
'An unusual case'
For a young teenage girl like Urmila to have silicosis is ""quite an unusual case"", says Dr Vinod Jangid, member of the pneumoconiosis board, which is responsible for diagnosing silicosis at the medical college in Kota, a district neighbouring Bundi.
It may be rare, but not as improbable as it appears, says Pekham Basu, an independent researcher on occupational disease among mine workers of Rajasthan. She suspects there could be more children with silicosis but the government will hesitate to certify young people.
""If children are diagnosed with silicosis, it means they are either living close to the mines, or they are working in the mines, both of which are illegal.""
Urmila began to work in the stone quarries next to the village in her childhood.
It is common here for men to work in mines and for women and children to supplement the family earnings by carving cobblestones by hand, chipping away with a hammer and chisel. Two years of this work and she began to fall ill.
""I could not work for very long, I was too weak,"" she says. No matter how many times she went to the doctor, she would not be rid of the fever, the cough, and the constant shortness of breath. The doctors suspected a case of tuberculosis, but after six months of treatment, she had not recovered.
Image copyright Ashish V Image caption The lung disease can lead to breathing difficulties, regular coughing and tubercolosis
Her mother, Hemlata, is 40, but she looks weighed down by age. ""I had to mortgage our house to pay for her treatment. I still owe money to the lenders,"" she said.
In 2015, Urmila received 1,00,000 rupees ($1,535, £1,160) as compensation that the Rajasthan government gives to silicosis-affected patients. Her family used the money to settle the mortgage against their house.
Hemlata works long hours in a mine close by, her husband does not contribute to the family income. After seeing her daughter suffer, she wants to protect her younger son Rohit from working in mines and being exposed to dust. That has not been possible as there is no other work. So, she lets him work intermittently.
Later in the morning, as the women piled into vans for the protest, Urmila remained at home. She did not have the strength to go out for a full day. Her mother decided to join the protest. ""Though we have received compensation, we're all in this together and I have to support other women,"" Hemlata said.
Image copyright Sunaina Kumar Image caption Many girls in the village attend sewing classes before they head to work in the quarries.
Before she found out she had silicosis, Urmila had never heard of it. She knew that the dust was not good for her, so she would cover her face with a scarf when she carved stones, which is little protection against fine silica particles.
She brings out her X-rays and medical certificates, stored in her room. She is not aware of the fatal consequences of silicosis, that it is not a treatable disease. She thinks she has been cured.
Her health is stable now, except for bouts of exhaustion and weakness, and a lingering cough that never leaves her. Some time ago, she took up sewing classes at the local non-governmental organisation (NGO) in the village.
She likes making things with her hands, and proudly displays an indigo-printed shirt she has stitched. ""Working with stones made me unwell. I like this work, it keeps me employed and healthy.""
It gives her the chance to go out and spend time with young girls of her age. Most of them work in quarries and head back there after classes. ""There are many girls in Budhpura who do this work. Some are 15 or 16 years, and some even younger. I wish they can be saved from this work,"" she says.

By Rich Mitchell
Senator John McCain sent a letter to the Trump administration asking DHS to waive the Jones Act as a way to curb the fuel crisis in Puerto Rico. Once again, he’s wrong.
Puerto Ricans are struggling to get fuel to run generators and automobiles and eight Senators had requested that DHS suspend the shipping rules. When the administration rejected their request, McCain stepped in and asked them to reconsider.
The Merchant Marine Act of 1920, also known as the Jones Act, requires that ships carrying goods between U.S. ports, including territories, be carried on ships built, flagged to, crewed by and owned by United States citizens or companies.
The law was suspended in Florida after evacuations and recovery efforts from hurricaneIrma put unprecedented demand on the fuel supply. Florida’s gasoline and diesel shortages came because demand outstripped available supply inside the state. Therefore, suspending the Jones Act so that vessels of any country could carry fuel to the stricken state made sense.
Puerto Rico’s fuel shortage is not an issue of supply to the island. According to FEMA and the territory’s governor, “there is plenty of fuel in the area.” Instead, according to FEMA, damaged port, road and other infrastructure is making it difficult, and in some areas impossible, to get the fuel to working gas stations. More ships bringing fuel to port won’t alleviate massive distribution issues.
Suspending the Jones Act would do nothing to alleviate availability or prices in hard hit Puerto Rico. John McCain is wrong – again.

3653,Bill on Guardianship Abuse Goes to Trump-But What Does it Actually Fix?,"By Janet Phelan
Senate Bill 178, The Robert Matava Elder Abuse Prosecution Act of 2017, has passed both the Senate and House and has gone to the President for signing into law. The Bill contains provisions on multiple issues involving abuse of older people, including telemarketing scams and elders incarcerated in foreign countries.
The Bill also takes a stab at addressing guardianship abuse, which has now become rampant in the US. This sort of elder abuse, however, involves multiple levels of government officials, including judges, officers of the court, non-responsive APS and police agencies, as well as already documented complicity by the very Department of Justice which is now mandated with investigating these crimes.
Guardianships are generally initiated through court proceedings when a family member or others make allegations that an individual is lacking capacity to handle his or her own affairs. Upon the appointment of a guardian, the alleged incapacitated person loses the lion’s share of his rights, including even the right to hire his own attorney to contest the guardianship. In addition, his assets are transferred to the care and authority of the guardian, who will also now make personal decisions for the ward, including whether or not he can see his own family, where he will live, what sort of medical care he will receive and more.
Guardianships are money intensive. It is estimated that 1.5 million adults in the US are under a guardianship, with assets between $50 and $300 billion having been transferred to the guardian.
The Bill requires at least one assistant attorney general to be appointed to each federal judicial district to investigate reports of wrongdoing by guardians. The Bill also mandates training a crew of FBI agents to investigate crimes by guardians and sets up a “Elder Abuse Czar” to oversee these new provisions.
THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM
However, the Bill ignores the glaring reality that guardians must report their actions and account for the ward’s funds to the court. Judges regularly approve accountings that don’t add up and also accountings that are clearly fraudulently enriching the guardian and attorneys at the expense of the life savings of the ward.
And judges do far worse than accommodate theft.
When California guardian Melodie Scott decided to withhold life-saving antibiotics from Elizabeth Fairbanks, who had come down with pneumonia, this decision resulted in Fairbanks’ death. San Bernardino Probate Court judge Mike Welch approved this decision by Scott without so much as missing a beat. Recently, Scott’s license to practice as a guardian (professional fiduciary license) was revoked by the State of California in a State office of Administrative Hearings Court.
About ten years had passed since Scott pulled the plug on Elizabeth Fairbanks. Dozens of other questionable deaths have been alleged to have taken place on Scott’s watch, including that of Lawrence Yetzer, Stevie Price, D’Wayne Cory and Frank Bellue, to name but a few. The current San Bernardino Probate Court judge, Kyle S. Brodie, however, continues to appoint Scott to new cases. Nothing in Senate Bill 178 remotely addresses the complicity of Probate Court judges in guardianship abuse, either physical or financial.
Recent investigations have raised serious questions as to whether these judges are being paid off under the table. The bizarre and untruthful response by the Department of Justice official Marve Williams, reported in the Vegas article linked above, should raise alarm. This is the same Department of Justice that is going to address crimes of guardianship abuse, according to Senate Bill 178.
While the Congress should be congratulated for finally attempting to address the issue of guardianship abuse, the Bill sent to Trump is a no-show. It fails to address the systemic nature of guardianship abuse and, once again, gives wide swath to the individuals who are truly responsible for the abuse. A black robe and a law degree are apparently still the best protection that money can buy, even against prosecution for the crimes of embezzlement and murder.

2265,"Woman Births Bi-Racial Baby, Tells Husband It Was From Random Sperm In The Jacuzzi","Woman Births Bi-Racial Baby, Tells Husband It Was From Random Sperm In The Jacuzzi. 
 
When Mark Smith found out that he was about to be a father, his excitement was beyond words. When he eventually found out he was having a boy, he was even happier.
 
He thought of baseball games, football games, fishing, camping, all the things that a father does when raising his son. His wife however never seemed as excited as him, but he just figured it was the nervous jitters of a new mom.
 
Let’s fast-forward through the next nine months. Smith’s wife, Janice Smith, alerted her husband that her water had broke and it was finally time. He grabbed a bag that had been packed for the last week, put his wife in the car, and headed to the hospital.
 
After an intense 12 hours of labor his son, who they had prepared to name Jordan, came into the world. Unfortunately Mark Smith’s excitement for the birth of his firstborn son turned into confusion as they handed him an African-American baby.
 
A nurse reported the events that occurred to a friend at the local news affiliate. And word seemed to spread like wild fire.
 
“What is this? What happened? Honey our son is black!” said Smith. Janice tried to look confused herself. She continued to say “I don’t know, I feel sick, I can’t answer these questions for you right now. I just had a baby”. Mark Smith responded, “Yes honey, a black baby.”
 
Reports state that after one hour in recovery, Janice finally remembered what happened. “Mark, I think I know what happened. Do you remember that one day last summer when I went down to the pool? I went into the Jacuzzi to relax my aching muscles. As I was getting in, there was a black man that was getting out of the pool. He had a strange look on his face, you know, kind of guilty. I think he did something in the pool and that’s how I got pregnant. You know I don’t know any black people. That’s the only way it could have happened.” 
 
Regardless of Janice Smith “facts”, her husband could not accept her story. They are currently awaiting their divorce, no DNA test was needed.

1774,The Marathon Ends: Pirates Take Finale By 11-8 Count,"The Marathon Ends: Pirates Take Finale By 11-8 Count
(Before It's News)
Quite the Bucco jump out of the gates against Gio Gonzalez. A leadoff single, followed two outs later by a couple of walks, a HBP (on the foot) for a RBI, a bases-clearing double by Mad Max and a Jacob Stallings knock made it 5-0 for Steven Brault before he pushed off the slab. Then again, maybe it’s one of those days as the Nats started with a two-bagger and walk, a double steal and an Anthony Rendon homer. Then Brault struck out the side. In the second, the Bucs got a couple of runners on but a J-Bell GIDP ended the frame; the Nats for their part left the bases loaded. The Pirates went quietly in the third, but not so Washington, which had the first four runners reach to cut the lead to one. Then Angel Sanchez was waved in and shut the door in a nice bit of work. The fourth went by without a run.

In the fifth, a Cutch double (S-Rod ran for him; apparently Andrew’s sore foot ached) followed by J-Bell & Freeser knocks plated a run before another DP, this one served by Joe Blanton v J-Lup, ended the frame. Johnny Barbato took the ball and walked a pair after an out, bringing in Jack Leathersich. A single packed the sacks but a whiff and a bouncer into the shift by Bryce Harper prevented any damage. Tanner Roark took over in the sixth and the bats continued to boom – a walk came around on Stallings double and Jake rumbled home after another single and groundout. Edgar Santana climbed the hill and stranded an infield knock and walk. Austin Adams got the wave for the Nats in the seventh and zinged the Bucs. Dovydas Neverauskas answered the phone and tossed BP again, giving up a homer, single and double as Washington pared the score to 8-6.
In the eighth, Ollie Perez gave up four singles good for two runs, bopped a guy to load ‘em and then walked in another tally. Matt Alber came on and gave up a Baltimore chop rap to J-Stalls (no one covered first, oops) before shutting the gate. Daniel Hudson came in for Pittsburgh and loaded the bases with an out, but got a timely DP to keep it 11-6. The Bucs went down 1-2-3 in the ninth and Dan Runzler tried to close it out, but Joey O dropped a fly ball and then J-Bell mishandled a roller and suddenly it was 11-8. George Kontos did put it away, getting a four-pitch whiff for his first save of the year.
Jake was swingin’ it too (photo Dave Arrigo/Pirates)
The game took four hours and 22 minutes, the longest nine-inning outing in history for both clubs. The Pirates used 23 players, including nine pitchers. The Bucs stranded 10 runners, the Nats 15; each club issued seven free passes. Pretty it wasn’t, but it beats the alternative. Nothin’ like a “Raise It” to close the campaign.
Notes:
Jake Stallings had three hits & a walk while Max Moroff had a knock and two walks; together they drove in seven runs and scored three. Chris Bostick & J-Bell had two hits and a walk, and Starling had two more raps to end the year on a 12-game hitting streak.
Steven Brault had a pretty miserable closing day: two IP, four runs, six hits, four walks and four Ks after 68 pitches.
On his last Sunday show of the season, GM Neal Huntington wouldn’t commit to Cutch’s return, but did say he’d be in center if he’s back. He added he hopes to have the same crew of big league coaches in the fold for 2018.
JJ’s mulling his future (photo Pittsburgh Pirates)
During the post-game, John Jaso told the beat folk that he was leaning toward retirement; he’s looking forward to traveling on his sailboat. JJ is planning on a trip to Puerto Rico to help with reconstruction as he has some building skills in his life toolkit.
The Bucs will pick 10th in the 2018 draft, finishing the year at 75-87.

2867,Damaged A380 to be flown to France to investigate engine blast,"An Air France Airbus A380 is seen during an emergency landing in Happy Valley-Goose Bay, Canada, September 30, 2017, in this still image taken from a video obtained from social media. Daniel Mcneely/via REUTERS
PARIS (Reuters) - French investigators are preparing for an intricate operation to repatriate an Air France Airbus A380 passenger jet that was forced to make an emergency landing in Canada after one of its engines came apart in mid-flight, people familiar with the maneuver said.
The Airbus superjumbo diverted to Goose Bay in Labrador on Sept. 30 after one of its four engines exploded over Greenland, sending the front part of the engine including its 3-metre-wide fan into the ice sheet 37,000 feet below.
More than 500 passengers and crew, some of whom had reported a bang and vibration, were picked up on two replacement jets after waiting for hours onboard due to problems in accommodating the world’s largest airliner at the remote military airport.
But the aircraft itself remained stranded while French-led investigators collected evidence and developed a plan for returning it to France.
Making the roughly 2,300 nautical mile (4,260 km) trip will need a switch in engines to help the mammoth jet fly smoothly.
First, the rump of the broken engine will be taken off the wing and flown to Wales, where manufacturer General Electric can examine it at its Cardiff repair workshop, the people said.
Then a spare engine will be mounted on the right wing in the same outer position as the damaged one. But this will only be used to balance the weight during flight and that engine will not be operable.
The people declined to be quoted as the plans have not yet been announced. France’s BEA accident agency declined comment.
The operation to fetch the double-decker jet is not the only challenging errand triggered by the mid-air explosion.
Some parts of the engine were retrieved by helicopter in Greenland on Oct. 6 and dispatched to BEA headquarters in Paris. But investigators still face a tricky search in uncertain weather conditions to try to find other missing elements before they are buried by snow.
Although nobody was injured, the engine break-up has led to what could be a lengthy investigation to ensure other aircraft are not exposed to the risk of damage from high-speed engine debris. Experts say such incidents are very rare, however.
GP7200 engines used on Air France A380s are made by Engine Alliance, co-owned by GE and Pratt & Whitney.

2243,2018 Player To Avoid: Don’t Buy Into Avisail Garcia’s “Breakout”,"2018 Player To Avoid: Don’t Buy Into Avisail Garcia’s “Breakout”
(Before It's News)
by Eric Stashin (aka The Rotoprofessor)
We’ve long heard about the potential of Avisail Garcia and on the surface it would appear like he finally delivered on it in 2017:
518 At Bats
.330 Batting Average (171 Hits)
18 Home Runs
80 RBI
75 Runs
5 Stolen Bases
.380 On Base Percentage
.506 Slugging Percentage
.392 Batting Average on Balls in Play
Obviously the BABIP jumps out as unsustainable, regardless of any other metrics. When you add in a lack of elite foot speed and a pedestrian 20.3% line drive rate and it looks all the more unrealistic. That alone is going to drag down his average, but it isn’t the only red flag.
Garcia’s strikeout rate stood at 19.8% last season, his first year below 23.0% since breaking into the Majors in 2012 (and that was based on 47 AB). He also continued to show abysmal plate discipline, casting even more doubt on his average:
SwStr% – 16.2%
O-Swing% – 39.8%
A career .277 hitter, Garcia had posted marks of .257 and .245 the previous two seasons. With the BABIP set to implode and the strikeouts potentially rising significantly that would appear to be a lot closer to the truth. At best you have to anticipate a .250ish average, and that’s simply not going to get the job done considering the other “tools”.
If Garcia had the potential to hit 30+ HR we may be willing to overlook the average issues. However he posted a 52.2% groundball rate in ’17 and owns a 52.9% mark for his career. That is always going to make it difficult for any hitter to post significant power, as his 16.1% HR/FB yielded his modest 18 HR total. That may be his upside, and with the way the ball was flying out of the ballpark in ’17 that’s not going to get it done.
In regards to “speed”, he has never stolen more than 7 bases in the Majors and is 23-for-43 over his Major League career.
So you have an average that’s going to implode, coupled with mediocre power and little stolen base potential. Does that sound like someone you’d want to invest in? Someone in your league may be willing to pay for last season’s average, but don’t make that mistake.

Raiders Throw Game to Punish QB Who Wouldn’t Protest Trump – Where Is Roger Goodell Now?
After the NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell turned zealot and decided Patriots QB Tom Bradey must be punished for someone under-inflating a game ball by –1.5 lbs. of pressure, and for Tom Brady being unable to discern this from holding a frozen ball in the middle of January in the middle of the Super Bowl, he should be suspended on absolutely zero evidence, we will see where he stands on an entire offensive line throwing a game due to racial and political divides that NFL players have decided to drag the league. I personally will not watch another pro football game for the rest of my life. I am not kidding you.
Goodwell has now come out on the side of the players who protested Trump and threw a football game so as to draw attention away from this scandal by calling Trump devisive. Is there any doubt Goodwell is a moral coward? If hypocrisy is the respect that vice pays to virtue, Goodwell has now paid enough to bankrupt the entire NFL.
Below is the full story for which there is tons of ample direct and circumstantial evidence. Where is Goodwell now? Will he be too much of a coward to deal with the situation that threatens to destroy the NFL? There is much more evidence for this than there ever was for going after Tom Brady. Now everyone will act as if this criminal matter never took place because they simple don’t have the nerve to follow their own rules and standards when it really counts. It is so much easier to go after one white man than it is to go after an entire offensive line of African-Americans corrupting the game of football due to their political affiliations and protests against America. If Goodwell does nothing, Americans ought to protest en mass.

(Before It's News)
Coming off the heels of a 20-6 victory against the Miami Dolphins in a game that some felt could end up being their only win of the season, the Jets came out and looked fantastic on defense once again, while their suddenly explosive offense did enough to get them a 23-20 win in overtime.
We talked about the lengthy list of outstanding performers last week and the list is equally impressive this week, so without further ado, the Jets top players from yesterday’s win:
DL Kony Ealy: According to PFF.com, Ealy was the first defensive lineman to have four batted passes in a game since 2015. Ealy also came away with an interception on a ball that he tipped straight up in the air. Ealy also added 3 quarterback pressures. It was an outstanding effort from Ealy we would later learn was dealing the the death of his sister earlier in the week. You can’t say enough about the effort he gave under those circumstances.
RB’s Bilal Powell and Elijah McGuire:
We could list them individually as Powell and McGuire were both fantastic, combining for 256 yards on 31 carries, an average of 8.2 yards per carry. Powell’s long of 75 yards was the second-longest run in team history, and McGuire added a 69-yard scamper of his own.
Elijah McGuire had 131 yards from scrimmage (93 rushing/38 receiving).
S Jamal Adams:
Once again, Adams was all over the field and seemingly flawless in coverage in a 5 tackle performance (3 solo). His career is only four games old, but it’s clear to any objective observer that he’s going to be a great one. He’s been used as a box safety, a coverage safety, a man cornerback and a linebacker. He has done all with no problems whatsoever.
S Marcus Maye:
While Maye was steady in run support leading all DB’s with 5 tackles, the safety is also a big reason why the Jets secondary has been so much better than the unit that was abysmal last season. In 2016 the Jets secondary allowed seven TD passes of 40 yards or more and four of those came in their first four games. Through four games this season, the longest opposing TD pass was Jay Cutler’s 3-yard toss that came as time expired last week. Maye is a big reason for that.
LB/FB Lawrence Thomas:
Over the past two weeks, Thomas has gone from rotational defensive lineman, to key versatile contributor. A former college fullback, Thomas has gotten some reps there over the past two weeks and has absolutely blown up defenders to spring Jets backs for big runs. Credit to John Morton for adding this wrinkle to his attack, because now a team that was thought to have no fullback at all, may have a pretty good one in Thomas.
Leonard Williams has been a big part of the Jets improved defense over the past two weeks.
DL Leonard Williams:
Once again Williams failed to get to the quarterback, but he was in on 7 tackles (3 solo) with several coming within a yard or two of the line of scrimmage. He’s still playing on a bum wrist but Williams’ improvement since a stinker in week two is a big reason why the Jets defense has given up just two touchdowns in the last two weeks.
OLB David Bass:
Having mentioned the impact of Leonard Williams above, you can’t not show some love to David Bass, who the team singed just a couple of weeks ago. For the second time in as many weeks, Bass was a factor coming off the edge and came away with multiple pressures and a sack. You can add Bass to a list of impressive low-risk acquisitions who are paying big dividends for the Jets at the moment.
Brent Qvale:
The entire O-line deserves a ton of credit in this game, but Qvale was a concern coming in for his first start of the season against Jacksonville’s front seven which is viewed as one of the best in the NFL. Minus a couple of hiccups, Josh McCown had plenty of time to throw throughout the day and the run game was dominant. The tone was set on the first drive when despite not coming away with any points, the Jets line stonewalled the Jaguars pass rush and Qvale was a big part of that. You knew if the line held up that well the rest of the way, the Jets were going to have a shot.
WR Robby Anderson:
No, Anderson’s stat line won’t blow you away (3 receptions, 59 yards), but he smoked an elite corner in AJ Bouye for a 41-yard catch and continues to show he can make plays against opposing team’s top cornerbacks. Not half bad for an undrafted free agent in his second season.
It’s been said time and again over the past several months that this season is about the development of this team’s young players. As it turns out, they’re developing a bit faster than many anticipated, and now they’ve got a shot to be over .500 at 3-2 if they can beat the Cleveland Browns on the road next Sunday. Enjoy it while it lasts, Jets fans.

Ivonette Balthazar, a Rio de Janeiro resident, got the heart transplant last year after Stefan Henze, 35, suffered a fatal head injury when his taxi crashed into a concrete barrier. His death three days later shook the German Olympic team.
Balthazar, who suffered a heart attack in 2012, participated in her first sporting event with her grandson in September, walking 3 km (1.9 miles) along Rio’s Copacabana beach. A cutout heart pinned to her shirt read: “I have a transplanted heart.”
She plans to push herself further to take up Henze’s sport.
“Today my goal is to do more and more. My body is asking for it, and I can’t let this heart go to waste,” she said. “I will get a canoe in the lagoon and paddle.”

Balthazar said she tried to contact his family after the transplant, sending a letter to them via the German consulate.

Trouble erupted in Dantal village near the India-Pakistan border on Sept. 27, when a Hindu priest accused folk singer Ahmad Khan of making mistakes while reciting hymns to evoke a Hindu goddess.
Khan, 45, was a member of the Langa Manganiyar community that has been singing Hindu religious songs and spiritual verses in temples and at festivals for generations. The priest suggested changes to the hymn, leading to an argument.
Police said the priest, Ramesh Suthar, and his friends then broke Khan’s musical instruments and killed him.
“The news of the murder triggered unrest between Hindus and Muslims who have been living together for generations,” said Gaurav Yadav, a senior police officer investigating the case.
He did not say how Khan was killed, but said Suthar had been arrested. The priest’s accomplices had fled, Yadav said.
Two of Suthar’s family members said he was in shock and refused to talk about the case.
Government authorities had sent paramilitary forces to the area but the Muslims, fearing clashes, refused to return home.
“For one small mistake the Hindus killed my brother,” said Rakha Khan, the dead singer’s cousin. “We can’t live in the same village ever again.”
Rakha Khan said they had sought refuge in a school and that the state government office and other local authorities were providing them with food.
The attack is the latest in a series of incidents targeting the minority Muslim community in states ruled by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalist party.
Since his Bharatiya Janata Party came to power in 2014, hardline Hindu groups and cow protection vigilantes have carried out numerous attacks on Muslims accused of eating beef or killing cows. Many Hindus believe cows are sacred and killing them is banned in some states.",fake
3138,US Seeks to Monopolize Cyberwarfare,"By Ulson Gunnar
The use of information to enhance martial power goes back to the beginning of human civilization itself, where propaganda and psychological warfare went hand-in-hand with slings, arrows, swords and shields.
The most recent iteration of this takes the form of social media and cyberwarfare where tools are being developed and deployed to influence populations at home and abroad, to manipulate political processes of foreign states and even tap into and exploit global economic forces.
In the beginning of the 21st Century, the United States held an uncontested monopoly over the tools of cyberwarfare. Today, this is changing quickly, presenting an increasingly balanced cyberscape where nations are able to defend themselves on near parity with America’s ability to attack them.
To reassert America’s control over information and the technology used to broker it, Jared Cohen, current Google employee and former US State Department staff, has proposed a US-created and dominated “international” framework regarding cyberconflict.
His op-ed in the New York Times titled, “How to Prevent a Cyberwar,” begins by admitting the very pretext the US is using to expand its control over cyberwarfare is baseless, noting that “specifics of Russia’s interference in the 2016 America election remain unclear.”
Regardless, Cohen continues by laying out a plan for reasserting American control over cyberwarfare anyway, by claiming:
Cyberweapons won’t go away and their spread can’t be controlled. Instead, as we’ve done for other destructive technologies, the world needs to establish a set of principles to determine the proper conduct of governments regarding cyberconflict. They would dictate how to properly attribute cyberattacks, so that we know with confidence who is responsible, and they would guide how countries should respond.
Cohen, unsurprisingly, nominates the US to lead and direct these efforts:
The United States is uniquely positioned to lead this effort and point the world toward a goal of an enforceable cyberwarfare treaty. Many of the institutions that would be instrumental in informing these principles are based in the United States, including research universities and the technology industry. Part of this effort would involve leading by example, and the United States can and should establish itself as a defender of a free and open internet everywhere.
Cohen never explains how this US-dominated framework will differ from existing “international” frameworks regarding conventional warfare the US regularly abuses to justify a growing collection of devastating conflicts it is waging worldwide.
And as has been repeatedly documented, the United States’ definition of a “free and open internet everywhere” is an Internet dominated by US tech companies seeking to enhance and expand US interests globally.
Cohen ironically notes that:
Cyberweapons have already been used by governments to interfere with elections, steal billions of dollars, harm critical infrastructure, censor the press, manipulate public conversations about crucial issues and harass dissidents and journalists. The intensity of cyberconflict around the world is increasing, and the tools are becoming cheaper and more readily available.
Indeed, cyberweapons have already been used, primarily by the United States.
Jared Cohen himself was directly involved in joint operations between Google, Facebook, the US State Department and a number of other US tech and media enterprises which before and during 2011 set the stage for the so-called “Arab Spring.”
It included the training, funding and equipping of activists years ahead of the the uprisings as well as active participation in the uprisings themselves, including providing assistance to both protesters and militants everywhere from Libya to Syria in overthrowing governments targeted by Washington for regime change.
One such tool used in these efforts was described in a UK Independent article titled, “Google planned to help Syrian rebels bring down Assad regime, leaked Hillary Clinton emails claim,” which would report that:
An interactive tool created by Google was designed to encourage Syrian rebels and help bring down the Assad regime, Hillary Clinton’s leaked emails have reportedly revealed. By tracking and mapping defections within the Syrian leadership, it was reportedly designed to encourage more people to defect and ‘give confidence’ to the rebel opposition.
The article would continue, mentioning Jared Cohen by name:
The email detailing Google’s defection tracker purportedly came from Jared Cohen, a Clinton advisor until 2010 and now-President of Jigsaw, formerly known as Google Ideas, the company’s New York-based policy think tank. In a July 2012 email to members of Clinton’s team, which the WikiLeaks release alleges was later forwarded to the Secretary of State herself, Cohen reportedly said: “My team is planning to launch a tool on Sunday that will publicly track and map the defections in Syria and which parts of the government they are coming from.”
Would Cohen’s more recently proposed “framework” have prevented the United States’ use of these cyberweapons against sovereign states to undermine sociopolitical stability, overturn entire governments and plunge them into enduring chaos many still remain in 6 years later? Most likely not.
What Cohen and the interests he represents are truly concerned with is that nations are now not only able to recognize, prepare for and defend against US cyberwarfare, they may be capable of retaliating against the US.
Cohen’s proposal for an international framework to govern cyberwarfare simply seeks to define it in terms that leaves the US with both an uncontested monopoly over cyberwarfare as well as the means to wield it globally with absolute impunity.
It would be not unlike current “international” frameworks used to govern conflicts between nations which the US has used to justify an expansive, global campaign of extraterritorial war stretching from North Africa to Central Asia and beyond.
Such frameworks have become enablers of injustice, not a deterrence to it.
As nations from Iran to North Korea are discovering, the only true means of defending oneself from foreign military aggression is creating a plausible deterrence to dissuade foreign nations from attacking. This is done by creating a price for attacking and invading that is higher than the perceived benefits of doing so.
Nations like Russia and China have already achieved this balance with the United States in terms of conventional and nuclear warfare, and have now nearly established a similar deterrence in terms of cyber and information warfare. For the rest of the world, developing cyberdefense is not as costly as conventional military or nuclear arsenals, making cyberwarfare a corner of the battlefield unlikely to be monopolized by the US as it had done at the turn of the century.
Ensuring that no single nation ever has the opportunity to abuse such a monopoly again means exposing and confronting efforts by those like Google’s Jared Cohen and his proposal for an “international framework” for cyberwarfare that resembles the same sort of enabling the United Nations provides the US in terms of proliferating conventional conflicts across the globe.

Ri's comments are likely to continue to fuel a mounting war of words between President Trump and Kim
(CNN) US President Donald Trump has ""lit the wick of the war"" against North Korea, a Russian state news agency quoted North Korea's foreign minister as saying on Wednesday.
The statement follows weeks of escalating tensions between North Korea and the United States, fueled by Pyongyang's repeated nuclear tests and Trump's tough talk.
Speaking to Russia's state-run TASS news agency, North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho cited Trump's September speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York as the tipping point.
""By his bellicose and insane statement in the UN arena, Trump -- it can be said -- lit the wick of the war against us,"" Ri is quoted as saying on TASS' English language website. ""We need to settle the final score, only with a hail of fire, not words.""
During his remarks at the UN last month, Trump threatened to ""totally destroy"" North Korea and mocked the country's leader, whom he referred to as ""Rocket Man.""

109,Trump Poised to Sign Order Opening New Paths to Health Insurance,"The plan for the presidential order was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.
Some insurers, including Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans, oppose association health plans, saying they would skim off healthier consumers and leave traditional insurers with sicker, more expensive customers.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
The National Association of Insurance Commissioners, representing state regulators, has long opposed association health plans, saying they are bad for consumers because they can operate outside some state consumer-protection laws. In addition, the state regulators said this year in a letter to Congress, proposals to allow such purchasing groups “could actually increase the cost of insurance for many small businesses whose employees are not members of an association health plan.”
But Mr. Trump has presented such plans as a potential solution for millions of Americans. He stated his intentions on Sept. 27 as he left the White House for a trip to Indiana.

“I am considering an executive order on associations, and that will take care of a tremendous number of people with regard to health care,” Mr. Trump said then. “I’ll probably be signing a very major executive order where people can go out, cross state lines, do lots of things, and buy their own health care. And that will be probably signed next week. It’s being finished now. It’s going to cover a lot of territory and a lot of people — millions of people.”
Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, said he had been working with the Trump administration to clear the way for association health plans, which he said would allow more people to obtain good coverage at a lower cost.
“The health care debate is not over,” Mr. Paul said. “Conservatives are still fighting for free-market reforms to the health care system. I am excited to be working with President Trump on this initiative.”
“Association plans would let plumbers, carpenters, welders or any type of small business band together to get group health insurance,” Mr. Paul said recently, describing his vision. “Literally any group — your church, the National Rifle Association, the American Civil Liberties Union — any group of people who choose to do so could offer cheaper, better health insurance.”",fake
3511,Federal Reserve Will Continue Cutting Economic Life Support,"[gard align='center']
By Brandon Smith
I remember back in mid-2013 when the Federal Reserve fielded the notion of a “taper” of quantitative easing measures. More specifically, I remember the response of mainstream economic analysts as well as the alternative economic community. I argued fervently in multiple articles that the Fed would indeed follow through with the taper, and that it made perfect sense for them to do so given that the mission of the central bank is not to protect the U.S. financial system, but to sabotage it carefully and deliberately. The general consensus was that a taper of QE was impossible and that the Fed would “never dare.” Not long after, the Fed launched its taper program.
Two years later, in 2015, I argued once again that the Fed would begin raising interest rates even though multiple mainstream and alternative sources believed that this was also impossible. Without low interest rates, stock buybacks would slowly but surely die out, and the last pillar holding together equities and the general economy (besides blind faith) would be removed. The idea that the Fed would knowingly take such an action seemed to be against their “best self interest;” and yet, not long after, they initiated the beginning of the end for artificially low interest rates.
The process that the Federal Reserve has undertaken has been a long and arduous one cloaked in disinformation. It is a process of dismantlement. Through unprecedented stimulus measures, the central bank has conjured perhaps the largest stock and bond bubbles in history, not to mention a bubble to end all bubbles in the U.S. dollar.
Stocks in particular are irrelevant in the grand scheme of our economy, but this does not stop the populace from using them as a reference point for the health of our system. This creates an environment rife with delusion, just as the open flood of cheap credit created considerable delusion before the crash of 2008.
Today, we find our economic fundamentals in complete disarray, but the overwhelming fantasy within stocks still remains. Why? Because yet again, for some reason, no one is ready to accept the reality that the Fed is pulling the plug on America’s fiscal life support. Nary a handful of economists in the world think that the Fed will raise interest rates one more time this year if ever again, and the threat of a balance sheet reduction is the furthest thing from everyone’s mind. Daytrading investors are utterly convinced they have the Fed by the short hairs. I say, the situation is actually in reverse.
The minutes from the Fed’s July Open Market Committee Meeting indicate that while the central bank has been the savior of stock investors for several years, the party is about to end. Comments on the risks a bull market might pose to “financial stability” have been more frequent the past couple of months
Only a few weeks ago, former Fed chairman Alan Greenspan commented that bond markets could collapse and bring stocks down with them do to overvaluations and increasing interest rates.
Recent spikes in markets despite a steady stream of natural disasters, threats of war with North Korea, as well is “increased inflation” (according to Fed models) due to the damage wrought by Hurricane Harvey suggest that the Fed will indeed continue hiking rates into our ongoing financial collapse.
The next FOMC meeting will conclude on the 20th of this month, and the question is, will the Fed surprise with a rate hike and/or balance sheet reduction program? I believe the odds are much higher than many people seem to think.
First, let’s be clear, historically the Fed’s predictable behavior has been to skip major policy actions in September and then startle markets with renewed and aggressive actions in December. People placing bets on a Fed rate hike in September would look at this pattern and say “no way.” However, the narrative I see building in Fed rhetoric and in the mainstream media is that stock markets have become “unruly children” and that the Fed must become a “stern parent,” reining them in before they are crushed under the weight of their own naive enthusiasm.
In my view, the Fed will continue to do what it says it is going to do — raise interest rates and reduce and remove stimulus, and that the mainstream narrative will soon be adjusted to suggest that this is “necessary;” that stock markets need a bit of tough love.
If the Fed means to follow through with its stated plans for “financial stability” in markets, then the only measure that would be effective in shell-shocking stocks back to reality would be a surprise hike, a surprise announcement of balance sheet reduction or both at the same time.
If the Fed intends to continue cutting off life support to equities and bonds in preparation for a controlled demolition of the U.S. economy, then there is a high probability at the very least of a balance sheet reduction announcement this week with strong language indicating another rate hike in December. I also would not completely rule out a surprise rate hike even though September is usually a no-action month for central banks.
This would fit the trend of central banks around the globe strategically distancing themselves from artificial support for the financial structure. Last week, the Bank of England surprised investors with an open indication that they may begin raising interest rates “in the coming months.” The Bank Of Canada surprised some economists with yet another rate hike this month and mentions of “more to come.” The European Central Bank has paved the way for a tapering of stimulus measures according to comments made during its latest meeting early this month. And, the Bank of Japan initiated taper measures in July.
Even Forbes is admitting that there appears to be a “coordinated tightening of monetary policy” coming far sooner than the mainstream expects. If you understand how the Bank for International Settlements controls policy initiatives of national central bank members, then you should not be surprised that central banks all over the world are pursuing the same actions and the same rhetoric. The only difference between any of them is the pace they have chosen in taking the punch away from the party.
The point is, when it comes to the fiat peddlers, there are indeed a few sure things, but continued stimulus is not one of them. One thing that is certain is that they will act in concert as they are clearly doing now in terms of policy tightening. Another thing that is certain is that if they plant a notion in the mainstream media — such as the notion that they are “worried about overvaluations in stocks” and that interest rates must rise, then they will follow through as they always have. Perhaps not at the pace the mainstream expects, or the pace I expect, but certainly somewhere in-between.
Finally, it behooves me to mention again that the Fed has done all of this before. In the lead up to the stock market crash of 1929, the central bank bloated stocks with easy credit measures and low interest rates, only to hike rates in the name of “quelling inflation.” This hacked the legs out from under markets with a machete, and the rest is history. The hidden purpose behind this tactic is extraordinary centralization on a global scale. The Fed is not interested in the health of the U.S. economy, it is interested in total globalization of all economies under one totalitarian umbrella. To make an omelet, you have to break a few eggs.
Of course, the Fed will not engineer a market crash in a vacuum. It is my suspicion that the next Fed meeting will be followed by a geopolitical distraction — the most likely candidate being increasing conflict with North Korea. Do not be fooled by the magic show. The real threat to us all is the central banking and international banking apparatus, including the BIS and the IMF. From now until the end of this year, remain vigilant.

A 4-page leaked document containing an expense report of a kidnapping of teenage girl Emanuela Orlandi, the 15-year old daughter of a Vatican employee who mysteriously disappeared in the center of Rome in June 1983, is being authenticated as we speak. The Orlandi family is upset with recent news and is demanding answers.
“This document suggests the Vatican took Emanuela to London and looked after her for a long period of time,” said Emanuela’s brother, Pietro, who has lobbied Pope Francis for help in finding the truth.
Father Gabriele Amorth, who was appointed by the late John Paul II as the Vatican’s chief exorcist and claims to have performed thousands of exorcisms, said Emanuela Orlandi was later murdered and her body disposed of.
In the latest twist in one of the Holy See’s most enduring mysteries, he said the 15-year-old schoolgirl was snatched from the streets of central Rome in the summer of 1983 and forced to take part in sex parties.
“This was a crime with a sexual motive. Parties were organised, with a Vatican gendarme acting as the ‘recruiter’ of the girls.

2495,China to Debtors: Pay Up or Be Shamed,"“This is a step toward a credit society,” Mr. Hu said.
Mortgages, credit cards and other consumer loans are a relatively new, but increasingly popular, development in China. Chinese lenders and officials have turned to unfamiliar and sometimes unorthodox ways to determine creditworthiness, including tracking cellphone use and counting toothbrushes in people’s bathrooms.
On a broader level, China has ambitions to establish a social credit system to track personal behavior. That goal, while technically challenging, is increasingly possible as China invests in artificial intelligence and as more people turn to online platforms for even the smallest transactions. Officials hope the new platforms will become a one-stop clearinghouse to help the local authorities expose those names and pressure them to make good on their debts.
China’s latest effort is unlikely to address the country’s current debt problems. Moody’s Investor Service and Standard & Poor’s both reduced their ratings for China this year, citing the debt binge. Most borrowing has been done by state-owned enterprises and local governments to help sustain China’s growth levels.
Large state-owned enterprises, widely viewed as too big to fail because of the employment they provide, have avoided defaults. That is in large part because they continue to get large loans from state-controlled banks, sometimes to help repay previous loans. Defaults by state-controlled companies have been extremely rare and confined to smaller firms.

Details of how Chinese officials would manage the online platforms were scant. The reports said that China’s banking regulator, the Supreme Court and the propaganda arm of the Communist Party had told local officials to complete the platforms by the end of the year and to make the public aware of the websites within two years. The China Banking Regulatory Commission declined to comment on Wednesday.
A possible model for the databases is one already maintained online by the Supreme Court, which mainly catalogs individuals, although it does include some companies and even a few small local governments. That database is based on debtors who have been sued and lost their cases in China, particularly in the more important courts in China’s judicial system.
The court announced in June that it had published more than seven million names of defaulters. The database has been used to put pressure on deadbeats by making it hard for them to travel. According to the Supreme Court, the database has already been used to block the sale of more than seven million plane tickets and nearly three million high-speed train tickets.
Banks and other lenders regularly check the Supreme Court database, but they do not add their own data on late or disputed payments, and they share very little data with one another.

China’s online giants were not mentioned in official news reports about the plans, but experts say they are likely to play a major role in the establishment of nationwide credit-scoring systems. Ant Financial — an affiliate of the Alibaba Group, the Chinese e-commerce giant that trades in the United States — said it had set up its own credit rating system, Sesame Credit, which monitors the Supreme Court database without contributing to it.
“Sesame Credit does not share user information with any third party without the consent of users,” Ant Financial said on Wednesday. It declined to comment on the details of the move toward local and provincial databases.
Chinese bankers say that the default rate for individual borrowers is very low in China, and that lenders have usually demanded a car or apartment as collateral before making the loan. The bulk of household lending in China consists of home mortgages, according to data from China’s central bank. Personal loans are limited but rising, the data showed.",fake

Louisiana police have announced arrest warrants for 10 people accused of a role in forcing a university student to drink himself to death last month.
All the suspects are affiliated with the social club that police say 18-year-old Maxwell Gruver was attempting to join when he died.
One Louisiana State University student is charged with negligent homicide and nine others are charged with hazing.
Police believe Gruver died after a fraternity ritual called ""Bible study"".
According to a police affidavit, on the night of 13 September, Gruver had been forced to drink during a Phi Delta Theta initiation each time he incorrectly answered questions about the university's all-male club.
Gruver died of ""acute alcohol intoxication with aspiration"", according to a post-mortem examination by the East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner.
The Georgia-native had a blood alcohol level that was over six times the legal limit for driving.
""Today's arrests underscore that the ramifications of hazing can be devastating,"" said university president F King Alexander on Wednesday.
""Maxwell Gruver's family will mourn his loss for the rest of their lives, and several other students are now facing serious consequences - all due to a series of poor decisions,"" he continued.
One suspect, Matthew Naquin, is charged with negligent homicide, which could carry a five-year prison sentence.
The others face charges of hazing, which carry a 10-30 day jail sentence:
Matthew Alexander Naquin, 19, of Texas
Elliott Eaton, 20, of Louisiana
Patrick Forde, 20, Massachusetts
Sean Paul Gott, 21, of Louisiana

""Michael's red jacket ended up being sold for $1.2m (£900,000),"" she says.

But he says it is quite possible to start a memorabilia collection for free.
""The film posters and lobby cards made to advertise films in cinemas often get thrown away. So why not make friends with your cinema manager and ask for posters or cut-outs when you see a film you like?""
So could today's rubbish be a future collector's item?
An original poster for the 1933 monster adventure film King Kong can fetch around £70,000.
""Who knows?"" says Mr Baddeley. ""But remember, whatever you buy you've got to live with it. Have it framed and enjoy it. If it goes up in value you've got a double whammy, if not, you've still got something you enjoy.""
At the auction, Stephen Lane, the head of Prop Store, gives me a whistle-stop tour of the day's top lots.
He won't be giving anything away for free but says that, in amongst the stratospherically expensive nuggets of movie gold, there are some very affordable items.

""The lots start at £40 to £60. For that you'd be buying crew items or gifts, things like call sheets which were used in the production. It might not be quite as personal but it's still something from your favourite film.""
That's good news for first-time auction visitor and Blade Runner fan, Chris Dagger.
""I don't have a big budget, the most I can spend is around £500,"" concedes Mr Dagger. ""I've got my eye on the Blade Runner crew jacket. I've always been a fan of the film and with the new one coming out, I'd love to buy it.""

There are no further bids in the auditorium, but there's an agonising wait as the auctioneer checks whether other offers have come in by phone or email.
None have, and to his delight and astonishment, Mr Dagger gets what he came for.

""It's such an iconic film and if you're a fan you know all the trials and tribulations they went through to make it.
""And here we are, surrounded by posters for the current film. I'm just really happy, there's not much more I can say.""

3269,Harvey Weinstein: Oscars academy to hold emergency talks,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Dozens of films produced by Harvey Weinstein have won Academy Awards
The hosts of the Oscars are to hold emergency talks to consider the future role of film mogul Harvey Weinstein following claims of sexual misconduct.
The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences said the allegations of sexual assault against Weinstein were ""repugnant"".
Bafta, the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, has already suspended his membership.
Weinstein strongly denies the allegations against him.
In another development, police in New York told the BBC they were looking to speak to an individual regarding an allegation against Weinstein dating from 2004. The NYPD did not provide further details.
The US academy, which has handed out 81 Oscars to films produced by Weinstein's Miramax studio and the Weinstein Company, said it would meet on Saturday to ""discuss the allegations against Weinstein and any actions warranted by the academy"".

A statement has also been issued by Cannes Film Festival, which Weinstein has attended many times.
President Pierre Lescure said they have been ""dismayed to learn of the accusations"".
""These actions point to a pattern of behaviour that merits only the clearest and most unequivocal condemnation.
""Our thoughts go out to the victims, to those who have had the courage to testify and to all the others. May this case help us once again to denounce all such serious and unacceptable practices.""

Meanwhile, former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton told CNN she felt ""sick"" about the allegations surrounding Weinstein, pledging to donate money he had raised for her campaigns to charity.
Weinstein reportedly raised more than $1.4m (£1.05m) for Democratic groups, and Republicans have accused Democrats of not doing enough to distance themselves from him.
'Powerless and scared'
A string of high-profile actresses, including Gwyneth Paltrow and Angelina Jolie, have come forward to accuse the movie producer of sexual harassment or assault.
British actress and model Cara Delevingne is one of the latest to accuse him of inappropriate behaviour. In a statement, she said he tried to kiss her as she tried to leave a hotel room.
""I felt very powerless and scared,"" she said.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Lea Seydoux starred in the Bond film Spectre
The French actress Léa Seydoux has written an article detailing her experience with Weinstein who she met at a fashion show.
She wrote in The Guardian about how he invited her to come to his hotel room for a drink.
""We were talking on the sofa when he suddenly jumped on me and tried to kiss me. I had to defend myself. He's big and fat, so I had to be forceful to resist him. I left his room, thoroughly disgusted.
""I wasn't afraid of him, though. Because I knew what kind of man he was all along.""
On Tuesday, Weinstein denied allegations of rape made in The New Yorker magazine. On the same day, his wife Georgina Chapman said she was leaving him.
Oscar-nominated actress Annette Bening said Weinstein was well known in Hollywood for being ""boorish"", but that she had not known the extent of his alleged behaviour.
""I certainly didn't know that this was going on to the degree that it was,"" she told BBC News. ""It's terrible. And it's great that these women have come forward. I really respect them. Maybe it's a tipping point. Maybe culturally this means that things will change.""

On Wednesday, US prosecutors defended their decision not to take action against Weinstein after a woman complained about his behaviour in 2015.
The Manhattan district attorney's office said undercover audio of the complainant and Weinstein was ""insufficient to prove a crime"".
Italian model Ambra Battilana Gutierrez, 22, had gone to police to accuse Weinstein of touching her inappropriately. She then agreed to meet the producer again while wearing a hidden microphone.
The district attorney's office said police arranged the meeting without informing them.
""Prosecutors were not afforded the opportunity before the meeting to counsel investigators on what was necessary to capture in order to prove a misdemeanour sex crime,"" they said.

They said the ""horrifying"" audio ""was insufficient to prove a crime under New York law"" which left prosecutors with ""no choice but to conclude the criminal investigation without charges"".
In the recording, Weinstein can be heard asking Ms Gutierrez to come into his hotel room. The model asks the producer ""why yesterday you touched my breast?"" He apologises, saying he ""won't do it again"".
Weinstein's spokeswoman Sallie Hofmeister said: ""Any allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr Weinstein. Mr Weinstein has further confirmed that there were never any acts of retaliation against any women for refusing his advances.
""Mr Weinstein obviously can't speak to anonymous allegations, but with respect to any women who have made allegations on the record, Mr Weinstein believes that all of these relationships were consensual.
""Mr Weinstein has begun counselling, has listened to the community and is pursuing a better path.""
On Wednesday she declined to comment on reports that Weinstein was intending to travel to Europe to enter a rehabilitation facility.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron said on Tuesday he is determined to engage Germany in a debate that he wants to push forward on European reforms, despite a cool initial response from Chancellor Angela Merkel.
“I believe that, if you have a vision, you shouldn’t go to the doctor but you should open a debate,” Macron said in Frankfurt, where he was due to meet Merkel and attend the opening of an annual book fair.
Macron’s visit is his first to Germany since Merkel narrowly won an election last month, losing votes to a far-right party that drew support from people angered by an influx of more than a million migrants over the past two years.
The 39-year-old French president, in a speech two days after the German vote, set out an ambitious vision for Europe, calling for tighter cooperation on defense and immigration, and for a common euro zone budget.
Merkel, still to begin what promise to be difficult talks on building a new coalition government, has cautioned that reforming the euro zone should not be the top priority and the debate should be more inclusive.

(Before It's News)
Can the Baltimore Ravens bounce back and beat Pittsburgh for the fifth straight time in Baltimore? RSR Staff give our predictions here:
Todd Karpovich
— Both teams are looking to rebound from brutal losses in Week 3. Baltimore will get a boost by playing at home, where the Steelers have not won since since Dec. 2, 2012.
— The Steelers gave up 220 yards on the ground to Chicago last game. Baltimore coach John Harbaugh said this week that running back Alex Collins could get more opportunities. Collins will seize the opportunity and finish with 80 yards and a touchdown.
— Joe Flacco will go back to managing the game and have modest numbers. His streak of nine straight games with an interception will come to an end.
— The Ravens will keep the pressure on Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, who will be sacked twice and have an interception. In 19 career games against Baltimore, Roethlisberger has 31 touchdowns passes and 21 interceptions, going 10-9 over that stretch.
— Twelve of the past 18 matchups between Baltimore and Pittsburgh were decided by three points or fewer. This one won’t be any different.
Ravens 24, Steelers, 21
Derek Arnold
I know Ravens fans are feeling down in the dumps after that beating we took in Jacksonville, but how do you think Steelers fans are feeling? They lost to Chicago last week, and the Bears looked like a Division III squad in Green Bay last night.
That’s today’s NFL, man. A whole lotta mediocrity. I’m not convinced that the Ravens are anywhere near as bad as they played last week. Toss that one out, and hopefully they won’t provide any more evidence that they’re 44-7-loss-to-Jacksonville bad.
Steelers fans are nearly as dismayed by the play of Roethlisberger so far this season as we are at Joe’s mishaps. On top of that, Fat Ben is pretty much always bad on the road, and pretty much always bad in Baltimore. Le’Veon Bell hasn’t gotten untracked yet after holding out through training camp.
I think this will be an ugly one, but give me the Ravens and the under.
Ravens 16

Ryan Jones
Both the Ravens and the Steelers have had uneven starts to the year. Pittsburgh barely beat a Browns team in Cleveland that the Ravens handled fairly easily, then they beat up on a pretty good Vikings team at home before losing to a pretty bad Bears team in the Windy City. Notice a trend? The Steelers aren’t the same team away from Heinz field. Meanwhile, us Ravens fans were feeling pretty good before last weeks debacle.
I expect the Ravens to rebound. The sense of urgency they had entering the season took a brief hiatus last week but this is a make or break year for some players and coaches in the Ravens organization. Even though they got a little cocky and forgot that last week I think we’ll see the offense play better and the defense more closely resemble the one we saw weeks one and two.
Alex Collins leads the team in carries and yards and sets himself up to be the starter going forward. He grinds out 75 tough yards on about 15 carries and scores his first touchdown.
The receivers get more involved and Mike Wallace finally gets the rock. He finishes with 80+ yards including a touchdown of over 30 yards.

Carey Stevenson
The Ravens defense still stewing off its London let down return to its dominant self. They’ll get just enough from their run game to keep them on schedule, a run game where Alex Collins takes over as the early down grinder. Out of necessity, Buck Allen catches a TON of check downs and Mike Wallace slips behind the Steeler defense for a big play. The Ravens pull out a typical hard fought game in the teens behind Justin Tucker’s leg.
Ravens 19 Steelers 16
Adam Bonaccorsi
Both the Ravens & Steelers can’t play any worse than last week; the question is who has the better ability to bounce back.
For the Ravens:
-Joe Flacco will bounce back with 2 scores (and the usual pair of picks), hitting Buck Allen twice in the end zone.
-The Ravens will total only 250 yards of offense, with the running backs accounting for 180 of those yards.
-The Ravens defense will steal a pair of Big Ben picks to shorten the field for Baltimore’s anemic offense.
For the Yinzers:
-Big Ben will find Antonio Brown for 2 touchdowns, and a third from Jesse James.
-Le’Veon Bell will be held in check, with under 75 total yards.
-The Steelers defense won’t do anything special, but the Ravens’ decimated offense will be held in check all day thanks to mediocrity.
Unfortunately, the Steelers have the lead in the 1-score game come 4th quarter, and manage to milk to clock to end it, as they steal one from the Ravens who fall to 2-2 and the fans go bonkers asking about top-5 draft picks, whether the Ravens will take a quarterback early, and how soon we can fire everybody.

3029,The N.F.L.’s Big Head-Scratcher: What’s Wrong With the Cowboys?,"And yet the Cowboys’ defense has not forced a takeaway in three consecutive games, and it has yielded scores on 14 of 18 possessions — six touchdowns, eight field goals — excluding the Rams’ kneeldown at the end of that game. Dallas’s offense has scored on seven of its last eight first-half possessions across these past two losses but has sputtered after halftime, managing two touchdowns and a field goal. Even when Dallas did score in the second half Sunday, going ahead late by 31-28, it mismanaged the clock.
Given 73 seconds and a timeout to guide Green Bay into field-goal range, Rodgers thought it better just to keep on going, to throw for a touchdown and finish the darn thing, and because he is Aaron Rodgers, that is what he does.
“Can I say the F word?” said Dallas defensive lineman David Irving, when asked to convey the difficulty of defending Rodgers. He quickly added, with a chuckle: “That guy is awesome at what he does. It takes everybody to stop one guy.”
That is both a platitude and a keen bit of insight. As precise a passer as Rodgers is when throwing from the pocket, all the Cowboys wanted Sunday was to contain him there. The danger he poses when he scrambles, when he improvises, can be measured by his absurd 35-yard sideline completion, on third-and-20, that set up the winning field goal in last season’s divisional playoff round.
But that was then, and the Cowboys are loath to discuss last season. It’s behind them, and all that. If they were destroying teams instead of getting clobbered by Denver and blowing halftime leads to Green Bay and the Rams, and if their offensive line were creating those same wide creases for Elliott instead of being manhandled across the first three quarters Sunday, and if they were zipping toward 13-3 again instead of explaining three defeats in five games, they might be more likely to elaborate on those comparisons.
Since they are not, the Cowboys were left to address less appealing things, such as how their offensive highlight of the game — the go-ahead drive that took 17 plays and consumed 8 minutes 43 seconds of the fourth quarter — came to unmoor them. It was the last two plays of that drive that seemed to haunt Jones afterward.
On second-and-2 from the Green Bay 11 with 1:24 left, Prescott threw an incomplete fade to Dez Bryant. Had the Cowboys run, they would have forced Green Bay to take its final timeout or, at the least, drained another 35 or 40 seconds off the clock.

Prescott then faked a handoff and ran for a touchdown. He could have slid at the 1-yard line, wasting more time and giving Dallas first-and-goal and four chances to breach the goal line.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Passing up a touchdown in that situation would have run counter to Prescott’s instincts — “It’s important to get in the end zone and put the pressure on them,” he said — and Coach Jason Garrett said afterward that he agreed with Prescott’s decision.
Jones appeared less certain.
“What we all wanted to do was to keep the ball away from him, but obviously we need to score a touchdown,” he said, referring to Rodgers. “We’ll be second-guessing those last two calls — and I know you will, as well — for a long time.”
The clock showed 1:13. As expected, the Packers said afterward they were confident that they would score, and the Cowboys said they were confident that they would prevent Rodgers from scoring. But had the fans been polled, they almost certainly would have deemed the outcome inevitable.
“It looked really easy,” said receiver Davante Adams, who caught two of Rodgers’s three touchdown passes. “Sometimes it’s not always as easy as it looks, but he makes it look that way.”
The best players display their brilliance in ways overt and subtle, and on third-and-8 from the Cowboys’ 30 and with the pocket collapsing, Rodgers slipped free from Benson Mayowa and rolled left, where he felt Irving’s arms around his ankles.
Photo
In the past, that effort might have been enough to bring down Rodgers. But he has been ever more cognizant of his running style — how, sometimes, he does not pick his knees up, which leaves him susceptible to getting tackled from behind. High-stepping out of the tackle, Rodgers scampered for 18 yards, to the Dallas 12.
On the next play, Rodgers couldn’t connect on a fade to Adams, covered by Jourdan Lewis, but he and Adams shared a glance. “Let’s do it again,” Adams told Rodgers. The quarterback amended the formation, and the ball was over Lewis’s head and into Adams’s hands before Lewis could even turn.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
“He threw it exactly where it had to be,” Lewis said.
Lewis, a rookie, had three pass deflections in an otherwise excellent game. But in tone and in substance, his lament was familiar.
Once again, the Cowboys could not stop Rodgers. Once again, they staggered in the second half. Once again, they scored 30 points and gained more than 400 yards and still lost. According to the N.F.L., the rest of the league combined has two such losses.
Dallas has yet to play Atlanta, Kansas City, Oakland or Seattle. Or division rivals Philadelphia and Washington — twice. Next week, the Cowboys get a reprieve.
The bye allows teams to reflect and assess all that has gone wrong and right. The Cowboys are bound to examine a running attack whose early struggles have put more of an onus on Prescott, and a defense that buckles at the game’s pivot points.
How the Cowboys perform when they return, on Oct. 22 against the winless 49ers, will help reshape their season. At least they will not score four touchdowns at home and lose. The game is in California.",fake

With the apparent switch from the defensive line to fullback for Lawrence Thomas and placing Dylan Donahue on IR, the Jets had a couple of vacancies to fill in the front seven and they did so by adding former Arizona Cardinals lineman Ed Stinson and former New Orleans Saints linebacker Obum Gwacham.

Head coach Todd Bowles should be somewhat familiar with Stinson from the time they spent together in 2014 when Bowles was the Cardinals defensive coordinator. The 6′ 3” 287 lb Stinson appeared in 10 games that season (2 starts), picking up just six tackles. For his career, the Alabama product has 22 tackles and 1 sack in 29 games.
Meanwhile, Gwacham is still a bit of a project, but one with off the charts measureables that make him worth kicking the tires.
Listed a 6′ 5” 231, the converted college wide receiver has played in 10 career games, picking up 2.5 sacks but only made the switch to defense in 2014 during his final season at Oregon State.
Donahue becomes the fourth Mike Maccagnan draft choice to land on IR joining Devin Smith, Lorenzo Mauldin and Charone Peake. He goes on IR having picked up three QB pressures without a sack in 4 games played.

1088,Catalonia’s Push for Independence Has an Unlikely Symbol: Tractors,"Last week, Mr. Colom and other farmers were participating in a general strike called across the region, and the tractorada was lending its mechanized mass in support of independence and to denounce the police violence that had followed the vote. When the local farmers’ union put out the call, hundreds of farmers responded — as did the people cheering them on.
Photo
“People who are Catalans are very Catalan here,” said Mr. Colom, a mild-mannered father of two, as he steered his tractor onto a dirt-covered square already full of giant machines.
Mr. Colom’s family owns one of the hundreds of farms scattered across the valley, whose center is the town of Vic. It is a major crossroads for two of the highways that cross Catalonia and bring the goods produced by the region to the rest of Spain and to France.
On any given day, trucks carrying milk, meat and livestock waltz through, and Mr. Colom and the others were headed to that junction. Their plan was to park right in the middle.
There was no struggle to get on the highway: earlier, the police had cordoned off a portion of the road, and they gently waved the tractors on. Crowds stood on both sides, chanting and singing to the sound of grallas, a type of flute that sounds like a bagpipe and is a popular instrument here.
It was not the typical farming scene: A documentary filmmaker moved among the tractors, shooting footage. Overhead, a drone buzzed as it filmed the procession. Once the tractors halted at the highway intersection, a massive traffic jam of trucks ensued. Unable to deliver their goods, a few of the drivers napped in the cabs of their trucks.
Video
The center of the Catalan independence movement is Barcelona, a cosmopolitan metropolis, where urbanites are at the core of the demonstrations — which is why the tractors are a seemingly unlikely symbol. Some tractors cost over 100,000 euros, around $117,000, and feature computers, joysticks, control panels with LED lights and air-conditioned cabins. Others are secondhand clunkers.

Farmers in the rest of Spain and Europe have for decades used tractors in protests about the cost of gas or the wholesale price of produce. But they have rarely attracted as much attention and popular support as they have in recent weeks in Catalonia. And even as the protest schedule is busy, so is the schedule on the farm.
“The cows dictate a rigorous schedule,” said Martin Serralonga, 50 as he drove on the highway at the speed of a snail. “For many people with livestock, this is the first time they’ve come out,” he said, adding that his son, as did about half of the crowd, had to rush home early afternoon to do the milking.
With some pride in his voice he added, “The politicians needed us to come out, like when we help fight wildfires, because we know the ground the best.”
The sudden attention on the farmers comes as many young people are leaving the fields for city life. Jordi Prat, 42, grew up in a family that still trades in livestock, but he opted to study in Barcelona and then become a dentist in Vic. Yet, when the call to protest went out to local farmers, he jumped in the driving seat of his family’s tractor.
Photo
When he was younger, he said, he spent entire days perched in the seat, working in the fields. Sometimes, when he climbed down in the evening, his legs were wobbly from exhaustion.
“We are the most hard-working country there is in Spain,” he said. “Here, people wake up to work, not to play the guitar.”
For all their symbolic force, the farmers themselves seemed uncertain about what independence would bring, or if it was even likely to happen as soon as regional politicians predicted.

They preferred to talk about their ancestors’ struggle, referred to in the Catalan anthem that crowds have been singing across the region. “Els Segadors” speaks of a 17th-century revolt by peasants and others against Spanish rule.
“Like in the anthem, we will break the chains with the sickles,” said Miquel Colom, 44, the older brother of Jordi and Imma.
As night fell on the valley and tractors headed home, Miquel was cleaning up the cement barn floor at the Colom family farm under floodlights as a herd of about 60 cows rested in their stalls.

The National League Central Division race is officially over. For the second-straight season, the Chicago Cubs are champions of the NL Central after beating the St. Louis Cardinals 5-1 on Wednesday night. It was a struggle early on for the Cubs offense as pitcher Michael Wacha was dealing for the Cardinals. The pitcher was locked in until the 7th inning when the Cubs struck. Trailing 1-0, Anthony Rizzo led off the inning with a single and advanced to third on a single from Ben Zobrist. But the big blow came from the next hitter Addison Russell. Russell hit a long home run to left field, giving the Cubs a 3-0 lead and a positive sign in his offense:

The Cubs would add on two more runs in the inning to make it 5-1. Chicago’s bullpen got out of a big jam in the eighth inning when Carl Edwards Jr. got Dexter Fowler to pop out with the bases loaded and two outs. Starter John Lackey was dealing, throwing six innings while giving up just two hits and one run. He’s been pitching his best baseball of the season as of late, a good sign for the Cubs.

“So quick to make excuses for him but will roast a minority player over an athem, dog fights, weed, domestic issues etc,” she wrote.
The debate over whether professional athletes should stand during the national anthem intensified after President Trump criticized players who have knelt to protest police brutality and racial injustice. Mr. Trump redirected the conversation away from those issues, arguing that the decision to kneel dishonored the flag and the national anthem.
Over the weekend, the Dolphins’ owner, Stephen M. Ross, spoke out in favor of players standing during the national anthem, The Palm Beach Post reported, saying that Mr. Trump had “changed that whole paradigm” of the protest. “I think it’s incumbent upon the players today, because of how the public is looking at it, is to stand and salute the flag,” Mr. Ross added.
That sentiment was echoed on Monday morning by Dolphins head coach Adam Gase, who said at a news conference that if players didn’t want to stand, they could “stay in the locker room.”
When asked about Foerster, Gase called the situation “unfortunate” and said the former offensive line coach was “upset, he’s mad at himself.”

“Anytime you lose a really good coach, it’s not ideal,” Gase said. “But we’ll rally. We’ll figure out a way. We’ll show up next week, we’ll do our thing.”
Gase also said that the team had not yet decided who would replace Foerster.
Earlier in the day, the Dolphins issued a statement saying that the team had accepted Foerster’s resignation and would work with him “to get the help he needs during this time.”
This isn’t the first time the Dolphins have had problems involving their offensive line unit. In 2014, a report commissioned by the N.F.L. found that three Miami offensive linemen had “engaged in a pattern of harassment” toward others in the organization: a young player, who ended up quitting the team, an offensive lineman and an assistant trainer. It was one of numerous controversies the league has faced in recent years.

The Premier League added: ""At the meeting, the subject of Christmas fixtures was discussed. Scudamore clarified that the December selections for live UK broadcast will be confirmed on 19 October, with the possibility the selection of New Year fixtures will take a further week to confirm.""
Deputy leader of the Labour Party Tom Watson, who had been a critic of the Premier League's plans, tweeted in support of Scudamore's announcement on Tuesday
MP Tom Watson had written to Scudamore urging him to reconsider staging games on that day.
The Labour MP's letter to Scudamore, obtained by BBC Sport, said: ""There's a real danger that some travelling fans would not be able to get home until the early hours of Christmas Day, whilst hundreds of stadium staff and workers would be expected to work rather than spending time with their families at this time of year.
""I accept that televised football on a Sunday, and over the Christmas period in the guise of Boxing Day fixtures, are a well-established part of the football calendar, but I urge you to recognise the concerns of fans, staff and families.""
According to the Football Supporters' Federation, Scudamore also said at the meeting that no games will kick off on Sunday mornings or evenings, while more midweek and bank holiday games will be broadcast on TV.",fake

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - French energy conglomerate Engie SA (ENGIE.PA) has appetite for more Brazil acquisitions, and will evaluate assets being sold by Eletrobras, despite spending more than $1 billion in a licensing auction last week, Engie’s local unit head told Reuters on Wednesday.
Brazil’s state-controlled utility Eletrobras, or Centrais Elétricas Brasileiras SA (ELET5.SA), said on Monday it will soon kick-start its divestiture plan which includes stakes in dozens of projects, mostly wind parks and power transmission ventures.
“We are open to opportunities, but always conservatively and with financial discipline,” Mauricio Bahr, Engie Brasil’s chief executive, said in an interview in Sao Paulo. “But our debt in Brazil is low so we have some room.”
“We would have to look asset by asset,” Bahr said, adding transmission lines could be of interest.
Brazil’s power sector is going through a process of consolidation, with many local players putting assets up for sale to cut debt as credit is tight. Brazil’s government has tried to attract foreign capital to help boost the economy by selling operating licenses for several projects.
Engie spent 3.53 billion reais ($1.13 billion) last week in a government-sponsored auction to win licenses to operate two large hydroelectric power plants in Brazil.
The assets will boost local operations which already contribute 18 percent to the company’s global results.
Engie and Eletrobras are partners in several projects, including the massive Jirau hydroelectric dam, a plant built in the middle of the Amazon jungle with capacity to generate 3,750 megawatts.
Eletrobras has hinted it could sell stakes in its large Amazon plants. Besides Jirau, it is a shareholder in Belo Monte and Santo Antonio dams.
“I don’t know if they (Eletrobras) will want to sell Jirau, it depends on their appetites. But eventually it will be natural for the partners, who have the right of first refusal, to end up exercising it,” Bahr said.",fake

820,Odell Beckham Jr. Is Injured as Giants’ Season Keeps Spiraling,"What they are offering fans are painful ways to lose in the final minutes. And the loss of prominent starters to injuries foretells perhaps more gloom to come.
The clinching blow Sunday occurred when Odell Beckham Jr. had to be carted off the field, face in a towel, with a fracture to his left ankle with four minutes remaining in the fourth quarter. On the next play, the Chargers’ Melvin Ingram sacked Eli Manning, forced a fumble and recovered it on the 11-yard line to set up Los Angeles’s go-ahead touchdown.
A funereal silence enveloped MetLife Stadium, which had remained upbeat as the Giants (0-5) had threatened to pull away but never did. It was replaced, as the players left the field, by full-throated boos.
One might say these are distressing times for a typically confident fan base. It went through this before, in 2013, when a bumbling Giants team began 0-6. But the expectations were different this year, within and without the locker room.
There, the shock, anger, even humiliation poured forth, along with the confusion.
“This was a game we really needed,” cornerback Eli Apple said. “This was the one. To let it slip through our fingers is definitely heartbreaking.”
Photo
The Giants tried going back to basics during practice last week, simplifying the calls, homing in on the fundamentals, even turning off the music that typically blares at points so that the players could better focus.
Reviewing film from previous games, the defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo let his players run the session, critiquing their own performances as they saw them on screen.

But there were events that fell beyond the control of the coaching staff, such as injuries. In 55 minutes, the Giants lost four of their top receivers: Sterling Shephard and Brandon Marshall (ankle injuries), Dwayne Harris (broken foot) and, of course, Beckham, who may need surgery.

On the team’s final drive, the Giants had to use three tight ends to fill the vacancies.
“Dwayne went down, Shep went down, Brandon went down, Odell went down,” offensive lineman Justin Pugh said. “It’s crazy. I’ve never seen that before.”
The rash of injuries added to the feeling of this being a rare, snakebitten year for one of the N.F.L.’s models of consistency. Asked if he could apply any lessons learned from that 2013 season, Manning shook his head.
“There’s not a secret formula to fix it,” Manning said. “Just got to play better.”
Last week, Beckham had made a passing reference to a defensive back for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who he said seemed to know what plays the Giants were running. The suggestion was that Coach Ben McAdoo, as the one who calls plays, was too predictable.
But the offense — which entered Sunday averaging 15 points per game, tied for 30th in the league — is only part of the Giants’ problem. The defense, which was second in the N.F.L. a season ago in points allowed, had surrendered more points and more yards than 24 other teams. Punter Brad Wing has had underwhelming kicks in consecutive weeks, and the kicker, Aldrick Rosas, missed a 43-yard field goal in the fourth quarter of the team’s loss to Tampa Bay.
In other words, there are a lot of problems.
“I think we showed a lot of fight out there,” McAdoo said. “But this is professional football. We’ve got to go to work and find a way to win.”
The predictability comment by Beckham could have stung McAdoo, a former offensive coordinator who was hailed as a scoring guru when he was hired. But last season, the Giants ran more than 90 percent of their plays with the same personnel grouping of three receivers, one running back and one tight end.
Are defenses teeing up? The team continues to lean heavily on that grouping, while McAdoo deflected the Buccaneers’ taunts as a “nonissue.” Yet for a team that boasts one of the league’s most dynamic players in Beckham and recently invested $11 million in Marshall and a first-round pick in a tight end, Evan Engram, the lack of offensive results remained perplexing.
It has been a season with few answers for anything. The Giants thought they had a chance to be one of the teams competing for a Super Bowl. Now they are one of the three still without a win.",fake

3811,Turkey summons US diplomat in tense visa spat,"(CNN) The Turkish Foreign Ministry has summoned the US embassy's deputy chief in an escalating diplomatic row that has put both nations' visa services on ice.
State-run news agency Anadolu reported that the Foreign Ministry planned to tell Philip Kosnett of the US mission in Ankara that they expected the US to lift its visa suspension, which affects all non-immigrant visa services in the country.
The latest tit-for-tat between Ankara and Washington began last week, when a staff member from the US consulate in Istanbul was arrested.
Washington responded with the visa freeze and Ankara responded by doing the same.
The US mission's deputy chief, Philip Kosnett, was summoned by Turkey's Foreign Ministry.
With some exceptions, the move effectively blocks Turks from travel to the United States, and vice versa, indefinitely.
""Recent events have forced the United States government to reassess the commitment of the government of Turkey to the security of US mission and personnel,"" a statement by the US mission in Ankara said on Sunday.
Hours after the US announcement, Turkey issued an almost identical statement with the two countries' names reversed.
US Ambassador to Turkey John Bass elaborated on the decision in a video message posted to YouTube Monday, saying, ""this was not a decision we took lightly and it's a decision we took with great sadness.""
Bass expressed concerns over the treatment of the arrested employee, who he described as a ""Turkish staff member"" who ""works in an office devoted to strengthening law enforcement cooperation with Turkish authorities and ensuring the security of Americans and Turkish citizens.""
Citing news reports suggesting the arrest was related to the employee's communications with the Turkish government in his official capacity, Bass insisted, ""speaking to and traveling with Turkish police was a part of his regular duties and the Turkish government has not shared any information to indicate the employee was involved in any illegal activity.""
""This arrest has raised questions about whether the goal of some officials is to disrupt the long-standing cooperation between Turkey and the United States. If true, this would put the people who work with, and work at, and visit our diplomatic facilities at risk.""
Bass said the US hopes the suspension of visa services will not last long, but added, ""at this time we can't predict how long it will take to resolve this matter.""
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan on Monday called the decision by the US to stop visa services ""very saddening.""
""It is sad that the (US) embassy in Ankara took this decision and started to apply it,"" he said during a news conference in Ukraine.
He said that the Turkish Foreign Ministry has contacted its US counterparts about the decision.
""When my minister told me about it I just said this: Turkey is a law state. First of all we are not a tribe or a tribal state. Our embassy (in Washington DC) should release a statement immediately same as theirs within the reciprocity principle. This is all about that.""
Another US consular employee sought
State media named locally-hired Metin Topuz as the staff member arrested last week.
He is the second US consular staff member to be detained this year.
Topuz was charged for having links with Turkish cleric Fethullah Gulen , who lives in exile in Pennsylvania.
Gulen is considered the main adversary of Erdogan -- the president blames the cleric for orchestrating an attempted military coup last year. Gulen has denied involvement in the coup.
The Istanbul Chief Prosecutor's Office said in a statement published by Anadolu on Monday that a third US consular staff member was being sought for questioning.
That staff member's wife and adult child have already been arrested over alleged connections to the Gulen movement, the statement said. Prosecutors said they were led to the pair after interrogating Topuz.
Ankara has repeatedly pressured Washington to extradite Gulen since the coup, and the issue has become a major thorn in relations between the on-again-off-again allies.
Turkey has carried out a widespread purge since the failed coup, detaining tens of thousands of people it accuses of having links to Gulen, including several non-diplomatic US citizens.
NASA physicist Serkan Golge and American pastor Andrew Brunson are among them.
In February, another US consular staff member, Hamza Ulucay, was arrested over alleged links to the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which both Turkey and the US consider a terrorist organization. Ulucay, a translator, was released and then re-arrested in March.",fake

275,Lambeau Field has become a House of Horrors for the Chicago Bears,"Lambeau Field has become a House of Horrors for the Chicago Bears
(Before It's News)
The Chicago Bears took on the Green Bay Packers lastThursday night with full momentum on their side after a thrilling overtime win against the Pittsburgh Steelers. But the momentum was gone after the first play on offense once the game started as Mike Glennon was sacked and fumbled, giving the Packers a quick 14-0 lead. The Bears never recovered. The loss is just another notch added to a growing trend that is terrible for the Bears as this is their 8th loss in their last 10 games on the road against the Packers. Even worse, all but one of those losses has been by 13 points are more and all have been on national television. Since 2011, All the of the Bears Packers games played at Lambeau Field have taken place during primetime, whether it be Sunday, Monday, or Thursday night. The last three contest have all been on Thursday night, with the first one being on Thanksgiving Night back in 2015 which actually was the Bears last win at Lambeau Field with the score being 17-13. The last two losses have been by a combined score of 37 points and the team has had three quarterbacks play as well, as last season starting quarterback Brian Hoyer broke his arm in the game and missed time last season.
Mike Glennon looked a lot like Jay Cutler last night for the Packers. Check out the rest of the highlights here: https://t.co/4CFCsVXHhz pic.twitter.com/OeUqzDbY68 — TheTundraEffect (@TundraEffect) September 29, 2017
The first of the consecutive primetime games came on Christmas Day in 2011 when the Bears were blown out 35-21.That game sawJosh McCown made his first start with Bears, the offense did rack up yards, but did turn the ball over twice. The 2011 team for that game was without quarterback Jay Cutler, running back Matt Forte, and wide receiver Johnny Knox who suffered a career-ending back injury the week before. The loss knocked the Bears out of the playoffs and dropped their record to seven and eight on the season. From 2012 to 2014, The Bears played the Packers in primetime on a different night each year. The first was a Thursday night game in week two of the 2012 season, the Bears were coming off a blow out victory against the Indianapolis Colts in the season opener and were in high spirits going into the game. Jay Cutler threw four interceptions and was sacked seven times as the Bears lost 23-10. In 2013 with new head coach Marc Trestman, Bears played on Monday Night in what would be the signature win in Trestman’s ill-fated coaching career with the Bears. Without Cutler and a very bad pass defense, the Bears upset the Packers 27-20 as backup quarterback Josh McCown started once again and had a phenomenal game throwing two touchdowns and posted a quarterback rating of 90.7. The Packers lost Aaron Rodgers early in the game due to a broken collarbone which was vital for the Bears winning the game. Just as the 2013 game at Lambeau was Trestman’s signature win, almost an exact year later, he would suffer his signature loss as a coach and it marked the beginning of the end of his tenure as Bears head coach. Coming out of a bye week where the week prior the team had been beaten badly on the road against the New England Patriots 51-23, many experts expected the Bears to play the Packers hard, but just the opposite occurred. Aaron Rodgers posted a historic performance as he threw six touchdowns in the first half alone. To make matters worse, it appeared that many Bears players had all but quit on the field as they showed no sense of motivation or pride to fight back to make the game look respectable. The final score was 55-14 and the Bears had set a franchise record giving up a combined 104 points in two games. The recent history at Lambeau is not pretty for the Bears organization or the fan base as coaching staffs and players have change, but results have been the same. What makes matters worse is that all these performances have been witnessed in primetime by a national audience which only enhances the severity of the losses. One can only hope that next season could be the first since 2010 to where the Bears play the Packers in Green Bay on a traditional Sunday afternoon and not in primetime. With the most recent outcome on Thursday evening, there is only hope that this last Bears game in Green Bay will be the last in a very dubious stretch of bad play against a rival that makes up the NFL’s oldest rivalry. The Lions back in 2015 snapped a 24-game losing streak when playing against the Packers in Green Bay, if the Lions did it maybe there’s hope for the Bears.

1285,"U.S. bombs dropped in Afghanistan at highest since 2010, under new Trump strategy","KABUL (Reuters) - American warplanes in Afghanistan are dropping bombs in numbers not seen since the height of the U.S. troop surge in 2010, after President Donald Trump announced a new strategy in August to ease attack curbs and widen the range of militant targets.
In September, for example, the U.S. Air Force dropped 751 bombs, an increase of nearly 50 percent from the August figure of 503, to reach its highest single-month total in seven years, military data showed.
“The increase can be attributed to the president’s strategy to more proactively target extremist groups that threaten the stability and security of the Afghan people,” the Air Force said in a monthly report.
Six more F-16 fighter bombers have been deployed to Bagram air field north of the Afghan capital of Kabul, and additional massive B-52 bombers have been assigned to strike Afghanistan from bases in the Persian Gulf, it added.
The Air Force numbers exclude strikes by the U.S. Army, which maintains armed helicopters and other aircraft in Afghanistan.
Trump’s South Asia strategy included promises to expand authority for U.S. forces to target militants in Afghanistan.
“These killers need to know they have nowhere to hide; that no place is beyond the reach of American might and Americans’ arms,” Trump said in his August speech unveiling the strategy.
“Retribution will be fast and powerful.”
Former President Barack Obama’s plans to drawdown the U.S. mission in Afghanistan often limited U.S. troops to attacking the Taliban only in certain circumstances, such as self-defense.
This month, Defense Secretary James Mattis confirmed to Congress that those restrictions would be lifted under Trump’s plan.",fake
522,Doesn’t Pay to be Ordinary on Defense,"Doesn’t Pay to be Ordinary on Defense
% of readers think this story is Fact. Add your two cents.
(Before It's News)
One of the reasons yards allowed is such a misleading statistic is that defense lives on the variation of yardage to stop drives. Said otherwise, an offense can move the ball robotically up the field with average run or pass results each play. It’s the defense which requires substantial variation of result to stop drives, primarily in the form of turnovers, sacks, offensive penalties, and key incomplete passes.
So how did the Ravens fare in these categories versus the Jags:
— No turnovers
— No sacks
— The Jags committed 2 holding penalties which did not stall drives.
— They also had a holing flag and a false start on the same series of downs where they still managed to get a FG.
— While Bortles had 8 incomplete passes in the first half, only 1 stalled a drive resulting in a punt, and only 1 other was in the same set of downs that resulted in settling for a FG.
Take out the kneels and the fake punt and the Ravens allowed a solid 3.6 YPC and 5.5 yard per play on all competitive defensive snaps, but the Ravens defense failed in terms of the pressure required to make the high-variation plays.
Not Scheming for Pressure
Here are a few supporting details:
— Pees called for just 3 blitzes from off the line of scrimmage (Onwuasor, Mosley, Correa).
— The Ravens had only 1 blitz that was deceptive by my definition (the first pass of the game had Onwuasor’s blitz coupled with a stunt by Suggs).
— Bortles had ample time and space (ATS) on 15 of 24 plays in the first half.
— Of the 9 first-half drop backs which were not ATS, 5 were designed to have the ball out quickly and were not pressure generated by the pass rush.
If you’re reading this piece after a beating like the Ravens just took, you’ve seen me present this chart and supporting details many times before with a summary in words. I’ll tell you what…you caption this in 1 or 2 pithy sentences, put it in the comments, and I’ll make sure to mention the best ones on the podcast. To be clear, I’m not looking for “the pass rush sucked”, but something that provides a little more insight/explanation as to why.
Individual Notes by Positional Group
Defensive Line
The line was taxed heavily as the defense returned to many more 4-DB sets and 2.5 defensive linemen per play. That, coupled with the absence of Brandon Williams and injury to Urban left the Ravens shorthanded.
Willie Henry (40 snaps) made his NFL debut on defense. In addition to 4 run stuffs (gains of 3, 1, 1, 3), he lined up as a 1, 3, and 5 tech. He was flagged for encroachment, an ongoing concern after leading the team in penalties during the preseason. Willie didn’t generate any pressure in 18 pass snaps, but his play lends hope that the DL can hold up with the absence of Williams and Urban.
Carl Davis (42 snaps) had his play increased sharply. Similar to Henry, he had 3 run stuffs (1, -2, 0) and drew 1 flag. He also generated 1 pressure in 18 pass-rush snaps.
Michael Pierce (55 snaps) also was effective versus the run with 3 stuffs (2, 3, 2). The issue with run defense wasn’t in the middle as we’ll discuss. Michael had no pressure events in 27 pass rush snaps.
Brent Urban was lost for the season after 18 snaps. He had been the Ravens iron man so far this season and a good source of interior pass rush (1 PD vs. Jags). The Ravens have Bronson Kaufusi available as the most obvious 5-tech replacement for Urban, but I won’t be surprised if they activate both him and Chris Wormley vs. the Steelers if Williams must sit again. The combination of Wormley and Kaufusi give the option for fresh inside pass rushers in a game where the pressure must be effective.
Patrick Ricard (5 snaps on defense) played sparingly despite the scarcity of linemen. Of his snaps, 4 came in goal-line formations where the Ravens used all 4 available down linemen.
Linebackers
The Ravens activated all 8 of their linebackers (5 OLBs, 3 ILBs).
Here are the total snaps, pass snaps, and pressure events for each of the OLBs
This is the group that let the Ravens down most, especially considering the mediocre Jags OTs (Parnell, Robinson) who played the bulk of the snaps. In addition, all of the big runs allowed to RBs came on the edge.
Tyus Bowser (8 snaps) regressed badly after being named Defensive Rookie of the Week versus the Browns. He was the first to lose Marcedes Lewis in man coverage for a touchdown (Q1, 3:39) when he bit on the TE’s play-action chip block and did not follow his release until it was much too late. He lost the right edge to TE Koyack, which helped lead Fournette’s 15-yard run right (Q1, 5:00). He capped his day by losing the left edge to the FB Bohanon on Ivory’s 9-yard run left (Q3, 3:24). It was on that play that Mosley was visibly upset. Bowser was removed and did not return.
Kamalei Correa (22 snaps) had his best career game. His highlights:
— (Q1, 7:25): He pursued quickly to take down Fournette for a gain of 5 (2 + 3 YAC) between the numbers and right hash.
— (Q2, 2:16): He came on a well-timed blitz off the offensive left side to deliver an unblocked QH on Bortles, who grounded his screen pass.
— (Q4, 8:51): He had tight coverage of Bohanon by the right sideline and undercut the short route for a PD and near INT.
He appears to be taking a different stance, closer to the line of scrimmage than Mosley. Since I don’t see how that would help in coverage, I assume it’s a mechanism to get him to make a quicker impact on run plays.
Patrick Onwuasor (33 snaps) got the start. He finished with 7 tackles, including 3 run stuffs (1 an assist), which masked a mediocre day in coverage. In particular, he missed a tackle to allow 4 yards after contact by Lee (Q1, 2:05), appeared to lose coverage of Grant on his 18-yard reception (Q3, 13:43), and failed to cover Bohanon well on his 8-yard reception (1 + 7 YAC, Q3, 1:19) by the right sideline.
Secondary
Jimmy Smith (53 snaps) played well. He was beaten for a 13-yard completion by Cole (Q1, 4:23) despite outstanding coverage by the right sideline. He otherwise did not allow a reception to his assignment and registered 2 PDs, 1 on a big hit of Bohanon (Q3, 12:11).
Marlon Humphrey (21 snaps) extended his playing time and continued to produce at a high level. To summarize his highlights:
— (Q2, 5:04) He both stripped and forced out Lee in the right side of the end zone.
— (Q2, 2:13) He undercut Bortles’ 20-yard pass for Cole between the numbers and left hash for a PD and near INT, but the play was negated by Webb’s illegal contact flag across the field.
— (Q2, 1:25) He had close coverage, leapt to knock the ball away, and was called for a ticky-tack DPI versus Lee down the left sideline for 29 yards.
— (Q2, 0:46) He had tight coverage and was credited with a PD on a ball Cole lost off his fingertips. Smith had contact on this play that looked much more like pass interference than the previous play.
He again had the lowest yards per play of any Ravens defender (3.8), including a large personal contribution. For the season, the Ravens have allowed just 2.7 yards per play with him in and 5.8 yards per play with him on the sideline.
Tony Jefferson (61 snaps) didn’t impact the game as Ravens fans would have hoped, which is something that almost has to be true in a game where the opposing TE has 3 TD catches. Jefferson had excellent man coverage of Lewis in the back of the end zone (Q1, 10:33) as the defense stiffened to hold the Jags to their first FG. However, he was victimized in man coverage by Lewis, who split wide for his 3rd TD from an initial Jumbo set (Q3, 7:54). Bortles threw a simple jump ball (it wasn’t really a fade) to the 6’6” Lewis, against which Jefferson had good success in 2016.
In the interest of forgetting this debacle, we’ll dispense with the 3 defensive stars of the game.

3871,"Russia, China call for restraint after Trump comment on North Korea","MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia and China called for restraint on North Korea on Monday after U.S. President Donald Trump warned over the weekend that “only one thing will work” in dealing with Pyongyang, hinting that military action was on his mind.
When asked what Russia made of Trump’s comments, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told a conference call with reporters:
“Moscow has called and continues to call on the parties involved in the conflict and on those who have anything to do with this issue to exercise restraint and to avoid any steps that would only worsen the situation.”
Commenting on a Trump statement that the United States might withdraw from a nuclear deal with Iran, Peskov said such a move would have “negative consequences.”
Speaking in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying reiterated a call for all parties involved with the standoff in North Korea to exercise restraint, describing the situation as extremely complex and serious.
China hopes all sides do nothing to irritate each other or worsen the problem and speak and act cautiously, she told a daily news briefing.
In recent weeks, North Korea has launched two missiles over Japan and conducted its sixth nuclear test, all in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions, and may be fast advancing toward its goal of developing a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland.
Trump repeatedly has made clear his distaste for dialogue with North Korea. Last week, he dismissed the idea of talks as a waste of time, a day after Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Washington was maintaining open lines of communication with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s government.
“Our country has been unsuccessfully dealing with North Korea for 25 years, giving billions of dollars & getting nothing. Policy didn’t work!” the U.S. president said in a Twitter post on Monday.
Trump’s comments seemed to further suggest that military action was on his mind.
On Saturday, Trump made a similar comment on Twitter about how negotiations have failed for 25 years and said “only one thing will work” with North Korea.",fake

By Bryan Dietzler
The Chicago Bears, fresh off a loss to division rival Green Bay, will host the Minnesota Vikings in their only Monday night appearance of the 2017 season. The Vikings are coming off a loss as well, 14-7 at the hands of division rival Detroit. They are desperately looking for a win. They come in with a record of 2-2 while the Bears have won just one game this season.
By now everyone knows that rookie quarterback Mitchell Trubisky will start Monday night. He replaces someone who could never quite do what the Bears needed him to do in Mike Glennon. The future is now, and it’s time they start to move forward. And with such a heavy investment in Mitch, it’s about time they did.
With this game being Trubisky’ s first start it will be a tough outing for the Bears’ passing game. It was already anemic and mistake-ridden air attack anyway so why not move forward instead of keeping it in neutral. That must have been what the Bears’ decision makers thought when they decided to put Mitch in.
We won’t talk about the Bears pass offense rankings. You can throw all that out now that Trubisky is in the lineup. The rookie will be facing the league’s 24th ranked pass defense so there will be some opportunities for them to pass the ball if they can get him going.
And if Mitch can throw the ball well hopefully his receivers will be there to not only catch it but hang onto it.
Mitch may want to rely on some of the team’s strongest pass catchers, their tight ends. Guys like Zach Miller and Dion Sims could help the rookie gain some comfort, and they could be a safety outlet when the heat is on. Trubisky needs to find a receiver he can rely upon and one of the tight ends would be a great outlet for him to throw the ball too.
When it comes to pass protection, the Vikings defense can get to the quarterback. They have 11 sacks in four games and their leader in sacks is Everson Griffen with five. Griffen will present many problems for the Bears’ offensive line. He will be going up against the likes of Charles Leno Jr., who, despite his critics, is one of the better offensive left tackles in the game.
Leno will have his work cut out for him on Monday night though.
The secondary for the Vikings has some great players in it. There is Bear “killer” safety Harrison Smith. Chicago fans know him all too well. He and two other teammates have one interception a piece this season so Trubisky better be wary of where Harrison and those guys are. If he finds them too often, it will be a long night.
The Vikings do play well against the run. Coming into the game, the Vikings are ranked third in the league allowing 71.2 yards per game. The Bears must run the ball to win and they could find it difficult Monday night. But having all of their offensive linemen healthy and ready to go will go a long ways to ensuring that they can run the ball. Chicago will see some success running the ball against the Vikings.
Remember last Halloween?
The Bears rushing offense is gaining an average of 117.5 yards per game which is 12th in the league. The Bears can win games on the ground so if they can run the ball well, they can win. But will the Vikings let them?
Minnesota’s best linebacker is Anthony Barr. Barr has recorded 26 total tackles this season and can make plays anywhere on the field. The Bears have to be wary of him. Taking care of Barr, who plays on the outside, will be the job of either Leno Jr., Massie or a tight end when the Bears run the ball.
Hopefully, those blockers will be able to take him out of the picture and free up some running room.
The will also need to worry about the Vikings leading tackler strong safety Andrew Sendejo. He can make plays in the secondary and will sneak up to play the run. Every blocker the Bears have available on Monday needs to be wary of those Sendejo and the aforementioned Smith. They can dominate any game.
Going back to the passing game, I don’t want to sound like a broken record but the Bears receiving corps is anemic. There is no star in that group and no one has stepped up to be their number one wide receiver. And with a rookie quarterback that makes his development even more difficult.
Aside from the tight ends and running, is there any other receiver who can step up?
The Bears have gotten some good play out of their defense and they can help Chicago win games if their offense can limit the mistakes.
The defense has been rocked by injuries as the linebacker and safety groups have seen starters go down. Of course, we all know that Jerrell Freeman is gone for the season and Nick Kwiatkoski is a few weeks away from coming back. Strong safety Quintin Demps will be out as also. And now outside linebacker Willie Young has been added to the injured reserve list.
Danny Trevathan will miss the game due to a suspension but even though the Bears’ defense is hurting they can still play and play well.
It’s not yet known who the Bears will face at quarterback for the Vikings. At last check, Sam Bradford was still a day to day decision. Case Keenum has been a good game manager and had a nice game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers but Chicago needs not to let him repeat that performance. They can prevent that with a solid performance from their pass rushing defense.
The Bears pass defense is ranked 15th against the pass allowing 220.8 yards per game. Minnesota’s passing offense is gaining an average of 263.2 yards per game which is 8th in the NFL. The Bears will have their work cut out for them. But not knowing who will play quarterback makes it a little hard to prepare.
The Vikings receivers are pretty good. Adam Thielen and Stefon Diggs are two very capable wide receivers. Diggs already has four touchdowns this season and is difficult to cover.
The Bears must shut him down.
Chicago’s secondary has its slip-ups, but overall, they can be solid. They have some strong players at the cornerback spot and use a three-man rotation to help keep things fresh. Prince Amukamara, Kyle Fuller, and Marcus Cooper are the starters. Bryce Callahan comes in as a nickel back and has done well this season.
There is a lot of talent in this group.
But the pass rush is the key component for making sure the Vikings can’t pass the ball all over the field. Chicago’s defense currently has nine sacks this year. Their leaders there are Pernell McPhee and Willie Young with two apiece. When you compare that to the top team in the NFL in sacks (which is Jacksonville with 18) that’s not great at all.
The Bears must get pass pressure on whoever the quarterback is for Minnesota. And now that Willie Young is out for the year, rushing the passer will get tougher.
Chicago’s most capable pass rushers are Akiem Hicks, Leonard Floyd, and Pernell McPhee. They will go up against an offensive line that has allowed just five sacks all season.
Getting a sack on Monday night is going to be difficult for the Bears. But even if they can’t get sacks, they can hurry the quarterback and make him rush his throws. That could help generate turnovers which the Bears will desperately need to stay in this game.
Stopping the run hasn’t been difficult for Chicago. They’ve allowed just 85.5 yards through four games which is good for sixth in the NFL. The Vikings have rushed for 108 yards on average which is ranked 17th. Remember that their leading rusher, Cook, is out for the year. So, facing a new running back may either be good or bad for Chicago.
When it comes to points scored per game, Minnesota is ranked 19th scoring 19.8 per game. Chicago is allowing a whopping 26 points per game which is ranked 27th. The Bears need to turn that around and start holding opponents to fewer points.
Maybe they can start against the Vikings? If they want to win they must that and this is the game to start a new trend.
When it comes to special teams, the Bears have some trouble in the kicking game with Connor Barth. Their dissatisfaction with Barth showed this week as they brought in some other kickers to try out. However, as this article is being written, the Bears have not signed a new kicker.
Barth is two of four on field goals this year which is disappointing. Compare that to Vikings kicker Kai Forbath who has made all but one of his field goals this season (six of seven). The edge here goes to the Vikings. The problem is if the game comes down to a field goal kick the Bears may not be able to win the game or trust Barth to win it.
That’s unfortunate.
The Vikings leading kick return specialist is Jerick McKinnon and he has a 26.1-yard return average. Chicago’s kick return teams are allowing an average of 17.5 yards per return. They must not allow McKinnon or any other special teamer make a mockery of them on Monday night.
The team that plays the best on special teams may win the game as a mistake on special teams could help swing a close game in one team’s favor.
The Bears leading kick return specialist is Deonte Thompson with a 23.3-yard average. Minnesota’s special teams are allowing 22.6 yards per return the numbers are even. Maybe the Bears can get something going here.
Pat O’Donnell has been solid this season. His average is 48.6 but the most important thing is that he has dropped eight punts inside the 20. The Bears should be very comfortable with him punting the ball. Minnesota’s special teams units feature Marcus Sherels who is averaging a lowly 5.6 yards per return. The Bears’ punt coverage teams, which are allowing just 8.7 yards per return so they aren’t getting killed there.
The Vikings punter, Ryan Quigley, has a 42.7-yard average with seven placed inside the 20. The Bears punt return specialists are averaging 8.7 yards while Tarik Cohen leads the way with 7.8 yards per attempt. Chicago needs someone to break some long returns and either get good field position or get into the end zone.
That will help them win this or any game.
The coaching staffs for both teams are very experienced. When it comes down to the head coaches and what they have to offer, Fox may have an advantage over Vikings head coach Mike Zimmer in years being a head coach. However, Zimmer is a smart coach who makes good decisions.
They match up well with against one another.
Anytime these two teams get together; the outcome is difficult to predict. Last year, in their first game, no one expected the Bears to beat the Vikings. At that point, Minnesota was having a strong season while the Bears were struggling like they are now. But Chicago derailed the Vikings so anything is possible on any given day in any game between these two teams.
This being Mitchell Trubisky’s first start, it will be a tough outing for the Bears. But I hope I am wrong. Every Bears’ fan hopes that Trubisky will be able to play a strong first-ever game. Coupled with a strong rushing attack and opportunistic defense, maybe he can help the Bears win.
But they won’t win it. It will be close but they will fall just short. Trust me; there will be better days ahead for the Bears.

1985,Paddock Shot Security Guard BEFORE Mass Shooting,"By Jon Rappoport
Huge can of new worms…
LA Times: “Police said Paddock fired 200 rounds into the hallway” wounding a hotel security guard.
LA Times, October 9: “Police have dramatically changed their account of how the Las Vegas massacre began on Oct. 1, revealing Monday that the gunman shot a hotel security guard [in the leg through the closed door of his hotel room] six minutes before opening fire on a country music concert — raising new questions about why police weren’t able to pinpoint the gunman’s location sooner.”
The previous police story was: Paddock shot security guard Campos after he finished firing on the concert crowd.
The LA Times focuses on how this new information changes the timeline of events—in particular, the addition of minutes before police arrived at Paddock’s door.
Really? That’s the takeaway?
There is a far more serious question. Why did Paddock shoot the security guard through his hotel room door, with 200 rounds of ammunition (according to police), BEFORE starting to fire on the concert crowd?
Whether or not Paddock was using a silenced weapon to shoot the security guard, didn’t he think 200 rounds through a door might possibly alert people in the hotel to what he was about to do—kill people at the concert?
Security guard Campos, according to the Times, was on Paddock’s 32nd floor to check on an alert about another guest’s room door having being left open. Campos wasn’t there to check on Paddock. There is no indication Paddock was suspected of anything.
The new Vegas police sequence of events now goes this way: Paddock is in his room preparing to slaughter people at the concert; security guard Campos comes to the 32nd floor to check on a report of another guest’s door having been left open; Paddock sees Campos out in the hallway outside his door (using a camera Paddock had installed); Paddock fires 200 rounds through his door and hits Campos in the leg; leaving Campos there, Paddock then WAITS SIX MINUTES and begins firing through his broken window(s) at the concert crowd.
Perhaps the police will change their story yet again. Paddock didn’t fire 200 rounds through his door. He stepped out into the hallway and wounded Campos with one shot using a silenced handgun. He then left Campos there, went back into his room, waited six minutes, and then started firing on the concert crowd.
Or, after wounding Campos with one bullet, he paid Campos with a pile of casino chips and told him to wait in the hallway and say nothing to anyone for a half-hour.
Or he bound and gagged Campos after shooting him in the leg and stuffed him into a laundry closet in the hallway.
Or, the most popular tactic in these untenable and absurd stories: “Obviously, Paddock was crazy. There is no way to account for all his actions. We may never know why he did what he did.”
That usually works with the public. The police or the FBI paint themselves into a corner trying to hide the truth. They realize their latest version of events makes no sense. So they invoke the time-honored “we may never know” explanation.
If some reporter wakes up from his stupor and resists going along with the story, he’ll probably hear: “Yes, we’re looking into that. But we have no further comment at this time.”
Or most likely, any time.
Here is a reasonable assessment: since very early on, police had decided on this story: Paddock was the shooter; he was the only shooter; he wounded the security guard after he finished firing on the concert crowd.
But the fact that the security guard was wounded BEFORE the concert shooting was leaking out. People in Las Vegas knew about it. So the cops (or the FBI) decided they had to get out ahead of the leak, if possible. It would be better to change their story than wait and end up with egg on their faces.
And so far, it looks like they made a smart move. Because how many media outlets are pointing out how crazy the new story is?
Most importantly, how many other egregious lies are sitting under the previous security-guard lie? How many other devious twists and turns in the true tale are being hidden?

2173,Trump: Iran deal 'incompetently drawn',"""I think it was one of the most incompetently drawn deals I've ever seen,"" Trump told Fox News' Sean Hannity.
""$150 billion given -- we got nothing. They got a path to nuclear weapons very quickly, and think of this one -- $1.7 billion in cash -- this is cash out of your pocket. You know how many airplane loads that must be? Did you ever see a million dollars, like a promotion, where they have a million dollars in $100 bills? It's a lot. This is $1.7 billion,"" Trump said.
The State Department had announced in January 2016 that as part of a decades-old legal settlement, it would pay Iran $1.7 billion to settle a deal over the sale of military equipment from before the Iranian Revolution.
Settling the claim was part of the Obama administration's efforts to strike a larger nuclear deal with Iran, which ultimately came to fruition in summer 2016.
However, Trump was vocally opposed to the deal on the campaign trail and since taking office. Just last week, two senior US officials told CNN the President has plans to ""decertify"" the nuclear pact this week.
""So this is the worst deal,"" Trump said on Hannity on Wednesday night. ""We got nothing. We got nothing.""
In September, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani warned against the US backing out of the deal, and said the United States would pay a ""high cost"" if Trump exited the agreement.
North Korea
In Wednesday's interview, Trump also touched on the tense situation in North Korea, citing growing US military capabilities
""It should have been taken care of long ago,"" Trump said. ""Clinton gave them billions of dollars, gave them lots of other things and before the ink was dry on the contract they were already starting again with the missiles and with the nuclear, frankly. So we are in a position -- look we're very strong -- I'm building up the military like nobody's ever seen, we're close to $800 billion in spending.""
Tensions between the two nations have been escalating, and on Wednesday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho addressed comments made by Trump at the UN General Assembly in September where Trump called North Korean leader Kim Jong Un ""Rocket Man,"" and threatened to ""totally destroy"" the country.
""By his bellicose and insane statement in the UN arena, Trump -- it can be said -- lit the wick of the war against us,"" Ri is quoted as saying on Russia's state-run news agency TASS' English language website. ""We need to settle the final score, only with a hail of fire, not words.""
Trump vs. NFL protesters
Trump specifically called out former San Francisco 49ers player Colin Kaepernick on Wednesday for his decision to kneel during the National Anthem at NFL games.
Kaepernick knelt during the National Anthem as a way to peacefully protest against police britality and racial injustice. On Wednesday, Trump called the action ""terrible"" and added he thought the NFL should have suspended him over the action.
""I watched Colin Kaepernick and I thought it was terrible,"" Trump told Hannity. ""And then it got bigger and bigger and started mushrooming. And frankly the NFL should have suspended him for one game and he would have never done it again.""
""I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color,"" Kaepernick told NFL Media in August 2016.
Trump has repeatedly condemned the players and teams who have participated.
""They could have then suspended him for two games and they could have suspended him again if he did it a third time, for the season, and you would never have had a problem. But I will tell you -- you cannot disrespect our country, our flag, our anthem, you cannot do that,"" Trump said Wednesday.",fake
3432,"In Long-Isolated Sudan, ‘Lot of Excitement’ as U.S. Sanctions End","The State Department also said the government has stopped attacking civilians and has improved in allowing humanitarian aid to reach troubled regions like Darfur, the scene of a genocide starting in 2003, in which the government was accused of massacring hundreds of thousands of people.
Washington said the country was also curbing its destabilizing activities in neighboring South Sudan, which split off as an independent nation in 2011.

The sanctions, which had been under suspension, will be lifted permanently as of Thursday.
In exchange for ending sanctions, the United States said it had secured a commitment from Sudan that it would not engage in weapons trade from North Korea.
The United States is still keeping Sudan on its list of terrorism sponsors, which means it will not be granted debt relief, a major drag on the economy.
The Trump administration decision has provoked a backlash from some human rights groups that say Sudan has not done enough to improve its rights record.
Amnesty International accused Sudanese government forces of using chemical weapons against civilians in Darfur last year, and there are ongoing skirmishes in the region. President Omar Hassan al-Bashir, who came to power 27 years ago, is sought by the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity and war crimes committed in Darfur.
Supporters of the American decision say the sanctions have done little to encourage reforms and instead pushed Sudan into the arms of United States trade rivals like China and the Gulf States.

Removing sanctions is an admission by the United States that they “are no longer appropriate and effective,” said Magnus Taylor, a Sudan analyst at the International Crisis Group.

“It is appropriate now to offer Sudan incentives and the beginning of a way back to a kind of international order from which it was thoroughly expelled,” Mr. Taylor added. “They had made enough progress to make the first rung of the ladder, and we need to keep pushing them to climb.”
Sudan is now expected to become at least moderately more attractive to Western investors, particularly companies eager to enter a region where countries like China, Malaysia and India are already present.

The lifting of the trade embargo “will be very positive for Bashir,” said Alex Vines, head of the Africa program at Chatham House, a research organization in London. “This has long been anticipated and it shows how Bashir has been remodeling himself through international partnerships.”
State Department officials say the removal of sanctions would unfreeze government assets and benefit aviation and energy businesses.
Sudan’s economy is mired in debt — foreign creditors are owed $51 billion, or 60 percent of its gross domestic product — and it suffers from high inflation and low productivity. The economy was dealt a severe blow after the oil-rich south tore itself away.
The sanctions placed restrictions on international financial transactions, making it difficult to acquire technology and equipment. Hundreds of factories were shut down because of a lack of parts and trade barriers.
Since the lifting of sanctions was announced, “there’s been a lot of excitement among the Sudanese middle classes, even for things like getting a cinema,” Mr. Taylor said.
Remittances from abroad will be transferred more easily, which will help lift domestic consumption and the economy.
“It won’t be transformational,” said Mr. Taylor, who called it “a first step in a normalizing process.”

377,5 Things to Think About,"By Tony Cartalucci
Headlines and commentary across both Eastern and Western media have mainly focused on the Catalan independence referendum and the actions of Spanish police and the Spanish government’s attempts to disrupt polls.
However, little is being said about what the real implications of Catalan independence may be. What do those politicians in Catalonia in favor of independence seek to do with it should they succeed? Will they create a Catalonia that serves the best interests of the people? Or serve the EU and NATO more efficiently and eagerly than a united Spain ever could?
There are 5 points those following this conflict should know and keep in mind as events unfold:
1. Catalonia has a formidable industrialized economy relative to other regions of Spain, with a GDP and population just exceeding those of nations like Scotland or Singapore, and likely could achieve and sustain independence from Spain.
2. NATO appears eager to encourage independence and would welcome what they expect to be a robust military capability to add to their wars of global aggression.
An article published in 2014 by the Atlantic Council – a Fortune 500-funded NATO think tank – titled, “The Military Implications of Scottish and Catalonian Secession,” would state:
Catalonia has 7.3 million people, with more than $300 billion in GDP. Spending just 1.6% of that on defense provides over $4.5 billion annually, or roughly the budget of Denmark, which has well-regarded and efficient armed forces. Catalonian military plans are more vague, but so far, they emphasize the navy. With excellent ports in Barcelona and Tarragona, Catalonia is well-positioned as a minor naval power, ‘with the Mediterranean as our strategic environment, and NATO as our framework’, as the nationalists’ think-tank on defense argues. The rough plans call for a littoral security group of a few hundred sailors at first. After a few years, Catalonia would assume responsibility as “a main actor in the Mediterranean,” with land-based maritime patrol aircraft and small surface combatants. Eventually, the nationalist ambition may include an expeditionary group with a light assault carrier and hundreds of marines, to take a serious role in collective security.
The Atlantic Council piece would emphatically conclude that:
If accurately characterized by the few white papers that have surfaced, the separatists’ position suggests a valuable and refreshing view of specialization in collective defense: build a navy that is comparatively focused on influencing events ashore.
3. Pro-independence Catalan politicians appear to enthusiastically support Catalonia’s membership in NATO.
…when the next Afghanistan comes, Catalan blood will also be spilled.
A 2014 article titled, “Catalan PM confirms NATO membership, commitment to collective security,” stated:
Prime Minister Artur Mas explicitly confirmed Catalonia is seeking NATO membership. In a recent interview with the Italian daily La Reppublica, Catalan Prime Minister Artur Mas explained that an independent Catalonia sees herself at the heart of NATO. This is in line with Catalonia’s commitment to the international community, the principle of collective security, international law, and the rule of law at sea.
The article also claims:
Catalonia seeks freedom, not to avoid the inescapable responsibilities that come hand in hand with it, but to fully exercise them side by side with partners and allies. Catalans understand fully that freedom never comes without cost, and that whereas independence means government of the people, by the people, and for the people, instead of alien rule, it also means that they will not be able to look the other way when a crisis or challenge arises. They understand that when the next Afghanistan comes, Catalan blood will also be spilled.
In essence, Catalan politicians appear eagerly committed not only to NATO, but to the foreign wars of aggression it wages, and spilling the blood of its people to help NATO fight them.
4. Some Catalan politicians have begun planning for its military’s integration into NATO.
The pro-independence Catalan National Assembly’s Defense Policy Working Group has stated in a 2014 paper titled, “Dimensions of the Catalan Defence Forces: Naval Forces (Executive Summary),” that:
The Mediterranean: our strategic environment. NATO: our framework The Firearms Survival Guide (Ad) Catalonia must participate in SNMG2 (Standing NATO Maritime Group 2; formerly Standing Naval Force Mediterranean), a component of the NRF (NATO Response Force). It would also be convenient to participate in the SNMCMG2 (Standing NATO Mine Countermeasures Group 2).
5. Like “Kurdistan,” any sort of “independence” is meaningless if the resulting state finds itself utterly dependent and entwined with Western hegemony and the institutions that maintain it – especially at the cost of member states and proxies – be they Kurdish or Catalan.
That Catalonia’s politicians have already openly and eagerly pledged Catalan blood and treasure to foreign interests and the wars they seek to fight across the globe, suggests that the notion of Catalonia actually achieving any sort of “independence” is actually Catalonia simply becoming more dependent on an even greater master, and one even further abroad.
Further Thoughts
These 5 points should be considered by those for and against Catalan independence. While Catalonia could create for itself a lasting and meaningful independence underpinned by peace and prosperity for its people, it appears that many in senior leadership positions intend to simply shift Catalonia’s subservience from Madrid to Brussels.
Further questions regarding Catalonia’s economy remain – including what an independent Catalonia might do to help feed larger, foreign corporations who may seek to circumvent barriers and obstacles in Spain’s current economic climate, and exploit an “independent” Catalonia, its people, markets, and resources. Unfortunately, such economic policies and their fallout may unfold long after it is possible for the people of Catalonia to do anything about it.
For the Catalan people dedicated to independence, they must find and use the local, socioeconomic leverage necessary to direct their potentially independent nation toward a trajectory that best serves them and their future – not a handful of Catalan politicians eagerly serving interests in Brussels, London, or Washington.

Ange Postecoglou refused to discuss speculation on his future as Australia coach after they beat Syria to set up a World Cup play-off with Honduras.
Reports in Australia have suggested the coach would quit regardless of whether the Socceroos qualify for Russia 2018.
Football Federation Australia chief David Gallop has also hinted at possible changes to the coaching team.
""My sole focus is on preparing the team for our final two qualifying matches,"" said Postecoglou in a statement.
""I will not let anything compromise the team's journey on getting to a fourth consecutive Fifa World Cup.""
Gallop said he had discussed the matter with Postecoglou after the Herald Sun reported that Postecoglou was irritated by criticism during his side's laboured qualifying campaign and the Sydney Morning Herald said he wanted to join a club overseas.
Media playback is not supported on this device Syria's 2018 World Cup dream ended by Australia
The Asian champions, who have reached the last three World Cups, scored an extra-time winner in Sydney on Wednesday to beat Syria 3-2 on aggregate and reach a two-legged play-off with South American side Honduras.
""We have every confidence that Ange and the players can get the job done,"" said Gallop, referring to the play-off.
""Beyond that, should we qualify, there is a period of some months until the World Cup and we agreed that we will need to lock in our set-up as soon as possible to maximise our preparation time.""
Former Brisbane Roar coach Postecoglou took over the Socceroos after Holger Osieck's sacking in 2013, and signed a five-year contract that is due to expire after next year's World Cup.

761,Chemist testifies VX found on 2 women accused of killing Kim,"Prosecutors presented the first evidence Thursday linking the banned VX nerve agent to two women accused of killing the estranged half brother of North Korea's leader at a busy Kuala Lumpur airport terminal.
In the trial at Malaysia's High Court, Siti Aisyah of Indonesia and Doan Thi Huong of Vietnam have pleaded not guilty in the Feb. 13 murder of Kim Jong Nam.
They are accused of smearing VX on his face, but the defense says the women thought they were playing a harmless prank for a hidden-camera TV show and had been hoodwinked by men suspected of being North Korean agents.
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is believed to have considered his older sibling a potential rival for power.
DR. RAJA SUBRAMANIAM, head of the Center of Chemical Weapon Analysis lab at the Chemical Department
Raja, the eighth witness and the only one to testify Thursday, said he found traces of VX on the two suspects.
He said lab tests detected VX in its pure form and VX precursors on Huong's white jumper, and a degraded product of VX on her fingernails. Huong was seen on airport surveillance videos wearing a white jumper emblazoned with the big black letters ""LOL,"" the acronym for ""laughing out loud.""
The chemist said laboratory tests also detected VX acid, a degraded product of the nerve agent, on Aisyah's sleeveless T-shirt.
He said VX will degrade once it is exposed to the atmosphere, and even faster when it is in contact with water.
""The presence of VX precursors and VX degradation products confirms the presence of VX itself,"" he said.
Raja also confirmed that he found VX on Kim's face, eyes, clothing and in his blood and urine.
Raja, who is the only Malaysian with a doctorate in chemical weapons analysis, said VX was a ""strategic"" choice of poison because it doesn't evaporate quickly and a person could be targeted without affecting the surroundings. He described VX as the ""deadliest nerve agent created"" and said literature showed that 10 milligrams, just a small drop, could be fatal.
Rubbing VX on a person's eye would be the fastest way to kill because the eyes have no barrier like the skin and have lots of blood vessels, he said. The palm is the least sensitive area and VX can be removed from the palm by washing it in running water and physically scrubbing it within 15 minutes of exposure, he said.
He agreed with the prosecutors' assertion that Kim didn't inhale VX because no nerve agent was detected on a nasal swab.
Raja said VX is oily and difficult to detect because it is colorless and odorless, and can be easily transported in a water bottle. He said Malaysia's airports do not have the special equipment needed to detect VX.

3914,Buyers eye Sinopec's Argentina oil assets in sale worth up to $1 billion: sources,"FILE PHOTO - The Sinopec logo is seen at one of its gas stations in Hong Kong April 26, 2010. REUTERS/Bobby Yip/File Photo
HONG KONG/SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Advisers to China’s Sinopec have offered its oil assets in Argentina to about a dozen potential suitors, three sources familiar with the matter said, as losses and labor headaches prompt Asia’s largest refiner to pull out.
The Argentine oil and gas assets, mainly in the southern province of Santa Cruz, could be worth $750 million to $1 billion, one of the sources said.
That would be less than half the $2.45 billion Sinopec paid in 2010 to buy the Argentine assets from U.S.-based Occidental Petroleum Corp, marking an aggressive drive to diversify its oil sources at the time. (reut.rs/2xtWaYi)
Prospective buyers for the assets - mainly large energy firms from the United States, Europe, Africa and Latin America -include Angola’s state oil company Sonangol and two Russian energy giants, including Rosneft, said two of the sources.
Mexico’s Vista Oil & Gas has also expressed an interest, according to a separate source.
Meanwhile, Compania General de Combustibles (CGC), the energy arm of Argentine holding company Corporacion America, would also be studying some of the assets in Santa Cruz, Corporacion America spokeswoman Carolina Barros said.
One of the sources said there could be more than 15 prospective suitors.
Sinopec is being advised by Scotia Waterous, a unit of Canada’s Bank of Nova Scotia, which focuses on energy deals, two of the sources said.
All the sources declined to be named as the sale plans are confidential.
Sinopec and Sonangol did not respond to requests for comment. Asked about the sale and its interest, Rosneft said it was not able to confirm the information.
Vista, Scotia Waterous and Argentina’s energy ministry declined to comment.
BOOM, BUST
In 2010, when Sinopec bought the Argentine assets, China - the world’s No.2 oil consumer - was scouting for natural resources to feed its surging economy.
Worsening economic conditions and social unrest in Argentina, however, have “weighed” on the operation since then, Sinopec said in September last year.
Argentina’s president, Mauricio Macri, has made attracting energy investment a priority since he took office in 2015. His government said last month it had brokered a deal to calm labor conflicts in Santa Cruz and lower costs.
But two sources said the Sinopec assets would be a tough sell regardless, given labor woes and declining oil output. Sinopec had already considered divesting the investment in 2015, sources told Reuters last year.
“It doesn’t have to be (fast), unless Sinopec is willing to lose a huge amount of money,” said one source, referring to Sinopec’s willingness to accept low bids.
Based on a $60 per barrel crude price, Sinopec suffered losses of $2.5 billion on oil projects in Argentina by the end of 2015, Chinese publication Caixin reported last year, citing an internal audit report.
“Golfo San Jorge, around where the Sinopec assets are located, is an old area,” said a different source familiar with the process.
“The (Santa Cruz) province recently auctioned off four areas, and three were won by locals - ENAP, CGC and YPF. It’s a tough sell, and soon there will be another offshore auction that might further reduce the attractiveness of Sinopec’s wells.”

1297,Bristol Bay: EPA plan 'inconsistent with basic logic',"(CNN) More than 40 congressional Democrats on Wednesday sent a letter to the White House expressing ""deep concern"" over the Environmental Protection Agency's recent proposal to ""reverse clean water safeguards"" for an area of Alaska that is home to the world's most valuable wild salmon fishery .
The EPA's move, if finalized, would make it more likely a large gold and copper mine could be built in the Bristol Bay watershed, the lawmakers warned.
""The EPA's plan to reverse clean water safeguards is egregious and inconsistent with science and frankly, inconsistent with basic logic,"" Sen. Maria Cantwell, of Washington, and Rep. Jared Huffman, of California, wrote in the letter , which also was signed by 40 of their colleagues.
The comments address a plan by Pebble Limited Partnership, which is owned by Northern Dynasty Minerals, a Canadian mining company, to mine for gold and copper in Bristol Bay. Such a mine would threaten ""the entire Bristol Bay region, salmon, and the multibillion-dollar economy it supports,"" the lawmakers wrote.
The letter comes after CNN reports showing EPA head Scott Pruitt directed his staff on May 1 to withdraw the Obama-era proposed protections on Bristol Bay . Pruitt gave the directive little more than an hour after he met with Tom Collier, Pebble's CEO, and without being briefed by EPA's experts on the matter, according to multiple sources and internal government emails.
The EPA's move would have to be finalized, and Pebble still would have to apply for and be granted permits to mine in the area before any construction could take place. Two public hearings on the EPA's proposal are scheduled to be held in Alaska this week. The public has until October 17 to comment on the EPA's proposed withdrawal of a move under the Obama administration to protect the Bristol Bay watershed from potential mining activities.
""Scott Pruitt is signing up to kill the largest salmon run on Earth and thousands of fishing jobs,"" Cantwell said in a statement emailed to CNN on Wednesday. ""The Northwest can't afford him or his job killing ideas. We can't let Pruitt pollute our clean water and throw away thousands of jobs because one mining CEO received special treatment.""
Collier, the Pebble CEO, denied he received special treatment. In an interview with CNN, he maintained a mine could be built in an environmentally friendly manner that would have no ecological ramifications. Pebble plans to file permit applications in December, he said, and the mine proposal will be far smaller than the EPA had thought when it moved, under the Obama administration, to protect the watershed and pre-emptively veto certain mining activities.
""The Bristol Bay watershed is 40,000 square miles with millions of acres already in protected status,"" Pebble spokesman Mike Heatwole said in an email to CNN. The company plans to propose a mine site that would cover 12.7 square miles, according to a presentation posted on the company's website. The EPA's proposal to withdraw Obama-era protections for Bristol Bay does not ensure a mine will be built, Heatwole said, but rather gives the company the opportunity to apply for permits. ""All we have ever sought is the ability to have the project reviewed like every other resource development project in the nation,"" he said.
A 2014 EPA report found a larger-scale mine would result in the ""complete loss"" of salmon habitat in some areas of the watershed. That report, which was based on three years of research, was the basis for a rare move in which the agency proposed pre-emptively protecting Bristol Bay from certain mining activities under a provision of the Clean Water Act, section 404(c).
The watershed produces nearly half the world's annual sockeye salmon catch and supports Alaska Native villages.
The prospect of a Pebble mine ""directly threatens our maritime economy and thousands of American jobs that rely on this world class fishery,"" the members of Congress wrote to the White House this week. ""We ask you to listen to America's fishermen and businesses and reverse EPA's decision to undo strong protections and clean water safeguards in Bristol Bay.""

2690,Rams Upset Cowboys on the Road,"Rams Upset Cowboys on the Road
(Before It's News)
It was a tale of 2 halves. The Rams were clearly outplayed in the first half, but despite the Cowboys dropping 3 TDs on the Rams in the 2nd quarter, the score going into halftime was only Rams 16 – Cowboys 24. In the second half a different Rams squad came onto the field. In the second half the Rams defense rose up and controlled the Cowboys offense. With a little more than 9 minutes remaining in the game the Rams had scored 19 unanswered points. The Rams then got conservation right at the end of the 4th which could have been costly. In the last 3 minutes they had a decision to play for the win or play it safe and settle for a FG. They played it safe which in my book was the wrong call. Luckily, the Rams defense did their jobs and forced the Cowboys to give up the ball on downs. Game over baby.
Main contributors in Rams victory:
1 Special teams play – Pharoh Cooper had 4 returns for a total of 123 yards. Good field position makes a difference in both moral and the pace of the game. And kicker Greg Zuerlein had a record setting performance kicking 7 field goals in a single game. 3 of those field goals were over 40 yards.
2 The Rams defense came up big. In the 4th quarter ILB Mark Barron came up with a clutch interception keeping the Cowboys from building momentum. The Rams defense put a lot of pressure on Cowboys QB Prescott and sacked him 3 times on the day.
3 Todd Gurley and Todd Gurley – Why 2 Todd Gurley’s? Because Gurley had a major impact on both the running game and the receiving game. On the ground he rushed 23 times for 121 yards. In the air he went 7 for 94 and a wicked 53 yard TD reception in the 3rd quarter.
The Rams continue to receive strong contributions from rookie WR Cooper Kupp who today chipped in another 5 receptions for 60 yards and a TD.
Not only are the Rams proving for the first time in many years they have a competent offense, they’re also starting to show signs of character. Signs of a winning character. Today’s victory gives us a 3-1 record and puts us at the top of the NFC West. Next week the Rams go back home and take on the vulnerable Seahawks. That should be an exciting contest. Have a great week Rams fans. Go Rams!!!

% of readers think this story is Fact. Add your two cents.

With multiple top tier wide receivers on their bye this week, fantasy owners are going to have to look a little deeper to fill out their rosters. Couple that with some injuries and questionable quarterback situations and things just never get easier during an NFL season, do they? With that in mind let’s take a look at how our options rank:
Odell Beckham Jr – New York Giants – vs. LA Chargers Jordy Nelson – Green Bay Packers – at Dallas Mike Evans – Tampa Bay Buccaneers – vs. New England A.J. Green – Cincinnati Bengals – vs. Buffalo DeAndre Hopkins – Houston Texans – vs. Kansas City Keenan Allen – Los Angeles Chargers – at New York Giants Antonio Brown – Pittsburgh Steelers – vs. Jacksonville Stefon Diggs – Minnesota Vikings – at Chicago Brandin Cooks – New England Patriots – at Tampa Bay Dez Bryant – Dallas Cowboys – vs. Green Bay T.Y. Hilton – Indianapolis Colts – vs. San Francisco Larry Fitzgerald – Arizona Cardinals – at Philadelphia Tyreek Hill – Kansas City Chiefs – at Houston Doug Baldwin – Seattle Seahawks – at LA Rams Pierre Garcon – San Francisco 49ers – at Indianapolis Golden Tate – Detroit Lions – vs. Carolina Chris Hogan – New England Patriots – at Tampa Bay Amari Cooper – Oakland Raiders – vs. Baltimore Randall Cobb- Green Bay Packers – at Dallas Adam Thielen – Minnesota Vikings – at Chicago Kelvin Benjamin – Carolina Panthers – at Detroit Alshon Jeffrey – Philadelphia Eagles – vs. Arizona Sammy Watkins – Los Angeles Rams – vs. Seattle DeSean Jackson – Tampa Bay Buccaneers – vs. New England Devante Parker – Miami Dolphins – vs. Tennessee Rishard Matthews – Tennessee Titans – at Miami Sterling Shepard – New York Giants – vs. LA Chargers Jarvis Landry – Miami Dolphins – vs. Tennessee Jeremy Maclin – Baltimore Ravens – at Oakland Devin Funchess – Carolina Panthers – at Detroit Danny Amendola – New England Patriots – at Tampa Bay Jaron Brown – Arizona Cardinals – at Philadelphia Martavis Bryant – Pittsburgh Steelers – vs. Jacksonville Will Fuller – Houston Texans – vs. Kansas City Allen Hurns – Jacksonville Jaguars – at Pittsburgh Tyrell Williams – Los Angeles Chargers – at New York Giants Michael Crabtree – Oakland Raiders – vs. Baltimore Marvin Jones – Detroit Lions – vs. Carolina Robby Anderson – New York Jets – at Cleveland Kendall Wright – Chicago Bears – vs. Minnesota Davante Adams – Green Bay Packers – at Dallas Nelson Agholor – Philadelphia Eagles – vs. Arizona Brandon Marshall – New York Giants – vs. LA Chargers Cooper Kupp – Los Angeles Rams – vs. Seattle Jermaine Kearse – New York Jets – at Cleveland Marqise Lee – Jacksonville Jaguars – at Pittsburgh Mike Wallace – Baltimore Ravens – at Oakland Paul Richardson – Seattle Seahawks – at LA Rams Terrance Williams – Dallas Cowboys – vs. Green Bay Eric Decker – Tennessee Titans – at Miami
Notes:
There is no way Antonio Brown is going to benched in any league this week. That said he is not going to be someone I target in DFS, and Brown is also not deserving of the top spot in these rankings. Last week didn’t go according to plan and his displeasure was quite evident on the sideline. Brown caught just four passes for 34 yards last week as Le’Veon Bell was the focus of Pittsburgh’s offensive game plan. Despite the fact that Brown is second in the NFL in targets and has two games of 100-plus yards, I would expect to see that continue this week. Jacksonville has the toughest defense in the league against opposing wide receivers, and Jalen Ramsey appears to be a formidable foe. With 388 yards so far this season, this likely represents the lowest Brown’s value will be.
This week I would look for Pierre Garcon to continue on his pace of alternating good games with duds. Matched up against Patrick Peterson last week Garcon caught four passes (on eight targets) for 36 yards. In the two games where San Francisco’s new receiver has been successful he has 13 catches for 223 yards compared to seven receptions for 62 yards in his other two games. Garcon is still looking for his first touchdown of the season, and there is a good chance it comes this week against the Colts and their lackluster passing defense.
Tampa Bay has just three games under their belt and DeSean Jackson is still looking to firm up his chemistry with Jameis Winston. Last week the growing pains were evident on the sideline, but two weeks ago Jackson did have four catches for 84 yards and a touchdown against the Vikings. Jackson’s lack of success isn’t for a lack of trying (Winston has targeted him 20 times in three games), but he has just nine receptions all year. The Patriots pass defense has left a lot to be desired so far this season, but if anything they will work to take away Tampa’s best weapon; Mike Evans. That could leave some room to operate downfield for Jackson. While I still have Evans ranked ahead of Jackson, the big play threat is nice boom or bust play who we know will be targeted.
While the Chargers have yet to win a game this season, Keenan Allen hasn’t been at fault. He has stayed healthy and last week caught nine passes for 138 yards while showing an impressive burst downfield. Not only has he been a PPR monster with a minimum of five catches each week, he has also showed damage after the catch. The Giants defense has struggled so far, but Janoris Jenkins is still a force to be reckoned with against the other team’s top receiver. Since Allen plays in the slot it is likely that Tyrell Williams will have to deal with Jenkins.
Will Fuller wasted no time jumping right back into the swing of things last week as he found the end zone twice after missing the first three games. Despite having limited practice time Fuller showed some chemistry with Deshaun Watson as the two have spent time working together. Watson appears to be coming into his own as a passer, but the sample size is still small and he is a rookie quarterback. With that being said, it was a good sign to see Fuller involved in his first game of the season as he caught four passes for 32 yards on six targets.
It sounds crazy to say, but in his third NFL season Devin Funchess eclipsed four receptions for just the second time in his career. Perhaps he is finally coming into his own, as he caught seven of his nine targets for 70 yards and two touchdowns. They were the first two touchdowns of the season who finally took advantage of Greg Olson being sidelined. That came after he caught four passes in each of his two previous games for 68 and 58 yards, respectively. With Kelvin Benjamin likely having to deal with Darius Slay this week, that should open some room to work for Funchess.

2299,"Nusra Front, Islamic State clash in Syria's Hama province","BEIRUT (Reuters) - Islamic State took control of some Syrian villages in a rebel-controlled area east of Hama on Monday, opening a new frontline days after the Syrian military said it had cleared Islamic State from a nearby area.
Islamic State said in a statement it had taken control of 12 villages and carried out a big attack on the jihadist alliance Tahrir al-Sham.
Tahrir al-Sham, spearheaded by al Qaeda’s former affiliate the Nusra Front, said in its own statement that Islamic State had stormed several villages and accused the Syrian army of allowing it to cross government territory.
A war monitor, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said Islamic State had taken 15 villages from Tahrir al-Sham, but that the jihadist alliance then took five of them back.
On Friday the Syrian army said it had cleared Islamic State from its last pocket of territory in a nearby part of the countryside east of Hama after months of fighting.
The Observatory and Tahrir al-Sham said those same fighters were the ones that captured the villages, appearing to have crossed government-held territory. The Observatory said some of them had crossed with groups of civilians.
Although Islamic State and the groups that make up Tahrir al-Sham, including the Nusra Front, subscribe to hardline jihadist ideology, they have opposed each other for years.
Islamic State has not held territory abutting areas held by jihadists or other rebel groups in northwest Syria, the most populous area held by the insurgency, since last year.
It has since lost swathes of ground to the Syrian army, backed by Russia, Iran and Shi‘ite militias, and a rival campaign by Kurdish and Arab groups in the north supported by the United States.

(Reuters) - Cable sports network ESPN on Monday suspended broadcaster Jemele Hill for violating its social media guidelines for a second time in the past month after she tweeted on NFL player protests.
Hill on Sunday said football fans should boycott advertisers of the Dallas Cowboys if they were offended by team owner Jerry Jones’ threat to bench players who did not stand during the national anthem.
ESPN said in a statement it had suspended Hill for two weeks for the second violation. It said she “previously acknowledged letting her colleagues and company down with an impulsive tweet” last month in which she called U.S. President Donald Trump a “white supremacist” who has surrounded himself with other white supremacists.
Hill is one of the hosts of ESPN’s sports news program, SportsCenter. In a series of tweets on Sunday and Monday, she responded to Jones’ comments about not playing anyone who was disrespectful of the U.S. flag.
“Change happens when advertisers are impacted. If you feel strongly about JJ’s statement, boycott his advertisers,” Hill wrote on Twitter on Sunday.
On Monday, before her suspension was announced, Hill wrote, “Just so we’re clear: I‘m not advocating a NFL boycott.”
She went on to say that an unfair burden was being placed on players whose owners directed them to stand for the anthem.",fake

Hochtief’s supervisory board is poised to discuss the potential Abertis acquisition at a meeting on Wednesday, two people close to the matter said.
If Hochtief goes ahead with a bid it would offer Abertis shareholders a mixture of cash and shares, they said.

The small, blue-green item broke the previous record, also set in a sale in Hong Kong, when a 500-year-old imperial “chicken” cup from the Ming dynasty Chenghua period sold for HK$281.2 million ($36.0 million) in 2014, Sotheby’s said.
The 13-cm (5-inch) bowl, used to wash brushes, was fired in the famed Northern Song dynasty (960-1127) kilns in Ruzhou, and was sold to an anonymous buyer after a 20-minute bidding battle.
Such “Ru guanyao” wares -- known for their intense blue-green glaze and “ice-crackle” pattern -- are extremely rare because the kiln in China’s central Henan province had a brief production run of only around two decades.
The bowl, from the Chang Foundation in Taiwan’s Hongxi Museum, is one of only four known pieces of Ru heirlooms in private hands. Since 1940, no more than six Ru vessels have ever appeared at auction, according to ceramics expert Regina Krahl.
“We’ve had in last 20 years a huge sort of influx of mainland Chinese buyers. We’re filling the room with new prices, new interest and that’s what’s really driven the price today,” said Sotheby’s Asia deputy chairman Nicolas Chow, who declined to reveal the nationality of the buyer.

1020,U.S. Treasury dashes hopes for near-term World Bank capital hike,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. Treasury official dashed hopes for a World Bank capital increase in the near term, saying the multilateral lender first needs to review its balance sheet to ensure resources are going to countries and projects that need them most.
The World Bank Group two years ago had set a goal of agreeing on a capital increase for its International Bank for Reconstruction and Development arm by the time of the 2017 World Bank and International Monetary Fund annual meetings, which start this week.
The IBRD provides concessional financing for projects in middle-income and creditworthy low-income countries.
But U.S. President Donald Trump’s “America First” agenda and plans to cut back foreign aid had cast doubt over the bank’s ability to win the support of its largest shareholder.
Last week, World Bank President Jim Yong Kim said the capital increase was a question of timing as the “vast majority” of the bank’s 189 member countries supported it.
But the Treasury official told Reuters on Tuesday that it was too soon to discuss such an effort because too much of IBRD’s resources were tied up in countries that had ample borrowing ability, including China and other larger emerging markets.
The World Bank needs to do a better job of “graduating” such countries off of IBRD support to private sector lending resources, the official said.
”Our view is that the World Bank Group as a whole needs to present substantial work on its balance sheet and the direction of that balance sheet as we go forward, the official said. “It’s early to be talking about a capital increase for the IBRD.”
The World Bank cannot proceed without the approval of the Treasury, which controls an effective veto on the institution’s executive board.
“So the bottom line here is right now we’ve got too high a percentage of the World Bank’s balance sheet that’s going to countries and to projects that already have ample borrowing capacity.”
China is IBRD’s largest borrower country, with $2.42 billion in loan commitments in the fiscal year ended June 30. The other top 10 borrowers were India, Indonesia, Colombia, Argentina, Egypt, Iraq, Turkey, Ukraine and Romania.
China is the World Bank Group’s third-largest shareholder, with 4.77 percent of voting power. But China also controls 28.7 percent of the new Beijing-based Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, which has $20 billion in paid-in capital, exceeding the World Bank’s $16 billion.
In August, the World Bank approved a $100 million IBRD loan to finance a program aimed at helping farmers clean up heavy metals pollution of agricultural land in the rice-growing Hunan province.
With a recent replenishment of the bank’s fund for the poorest countries, the International Development Association, the Treasury official said there were ample multilateral lending resources, and administration was concerned that some countries were jeopardizing future growth by taking on too much concessional debt.
“To fund development needs, there needs to be renewed focus on domestic resource mobilization and engagement in private sector development,” the official said.
A World Bank spokesman said that the bank started work last April to develop options to expand its financial capacity, and “extensive technical work is being undertaken.”",fake

Opinions matter though, especially if it’s smart opinion and relevant to a situation. Especially if you keep it clean. And you know what? After Friday night’s devastating loss… people were annoyed, and aggravated and wanted answers as to why Girardi didn’t challenge the “hit by pitch” that eventually led to a grand slam and the Indians beating the Yanks. It will haunt Joe forever if the Yankees don’t win this series… that’s for sure.
Now look, I found this “snipe” by Aroldis Chapman fascinating… and to be honest… it sends a message to his manager.
I’ll let the New York Daily News take it from here:
“If Yankee fans think Joe Girardi’s tenure as manager should be coming to an end, it seems Aroldis Chapman might ‘like’ that idea.
The Bombers closer liked a comment on his Instagram page early Saturday morning insinuating that Girardi shouldn’t return as skipper in 2018.
‘Let’s hope Joe’s contract is not renewed after the season,’ the comment Chapman liked, written by user @millsjr33, reads. ‘He’s an imbecile.’”
Photo: Getty Images
Does that form a “struggle” in the Yankee clubhouse now? Absolutely, but so did Girardi’s lack of leadership the other night. Will Chapman be reprimanded? Sure, he should. Punished… absolutely. Does he care? Nope.
And here’s the thing… I side with Chapman here. Sometimes you need to send a message to management that things aren’t being handled correctly. Sometimes you need to remind them that they need to be there for the team, and not sit on your hands and do nothing. The lack of challenge the other night was not Joe’s style and that was weird to me.
Photo: Getty Images
He’s been aggressive and backing his team all year. But not the other night.
He pulled CC too early… he didn’t challenge and the binder thinking started creeping in.
Chapman sent a message. I don’t care that reports are that he apologized and that the “team” said he did it accidently. What I do know is it got people talking… and regardless of the apology and team statement on the matter… it was done intentionally.
Now it’s Joe’s move.

3886,Why 'Blade Runner' is more relevant today than it was 35 years ago,"(CNN) Ridley Scott's ""Blade Runner"" opened in June of 1982 starring arguably the biggest actor in the world at the time, Harrison Ford. While it was positioned to be a blockbuster, the film faded after a few weeks with minimal box office gross and mixed reviews.
So why decades later is a film that made only $32 million now a major Hollywood sequel?
Away from its multiple director cuts over the years and visionary production design, what's kept ""Blade Runner"" in the cultural zeitgeist -- and what makes ""Blade Runner 2049"" current -- are the questions the films explore regarding the fundamental rights of men and machines.
""I think that these questions about what is it okay to build -- and even questions of genetic modification -- seem to be much more relevant today than they were 35 years ago,"" Kate Darling , a researcher at M.I.T.'s media lab who focuses on robotics and ethics, told CNN.
These subjects, along with a 88% score on review site Rotten Tomatoes , have given ""Blade Runner 2049"" plenty of advance buzz. Industry analysts are projecting a solid $50 million domestic opening for the Warner Bros. film, which stars Ryan Gosling and Ford reprising his role of Rick Deckard. There's even talk that the film may have a long run during awards season
Questions regarding humanity's impact on technology have also become a big theme in popular culture as of late, showcased in Netflix's ""Black Mirror"" and HBO's ""Westworld,"" a drama series based on the 1973 film.
So while the technological morality explored in the orignal ""Blade Runner"" may have been slightly ahead of its time, Darling believes that theme is now right on time.
""Is it right to create something that wants to be alive and to treat it like a slave?"" Darling said. ""I mean, that's really the main question that [""Blade Runner""] wants viewers to ask themselves because we are moving in a direction where we might be able to do that.""

The U.S. Department of State is pulling the majority of its diplomatic personnel from the American Embassy in Havana and warning Americans not to visit Cuba after at least 21 U.S. citizens stationed there were mysteriously injured.
The State Department is sending all non-essential staff out of the Cuba leaving only “emergency personnel” which will halt all visa processing.
The department is also issuing a travel warning, urging Americans to stay away from the Carribean island nation out of fear that they could become targets as some of the attacks had happened at hotels.
The injuries resulting from what department officials refer to as “targeted attacks” range from hearing loss to cognitive issues and sleeping disorders. U.S. officials blame “sonic attacks” for the neurologic symptoms expressed by those affected.
Cuba denies having anything to do with the attacks and almost a year after the first complaints, U.S. investigators have been unable to determine who or what is causing the injuries.
Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez met with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson Tuesday where he was told that “independent of who is doing it, the Cubans have a responsibility for the safety and well-being of our people.”
The reduction in staffing comes at a pivotal time in Cuba as Raul Castro is expected to step down as the nation’s leader when his current five-year term ends in early 2018.
Canadian diplomats report having suffered similar health problems.

Sometimes because of match-ups you have to roll out less than ideal lineups, especially when your players are nicked up. That’s the nature of the beast. Sometimes you need a fantasy gem to be successful. Here are some of the under the radar players that could possibly pull out a win for you.
.
Blake Bortles, QB, Jacksonville Jaguars – Puts up a few scores against the Jets?
Jay Cutler, QB, Miami Dolphins – Picks on Saints’ secondary?
Andy Dalton, QB, Cincinnati Bengals – Feeds A.J. Green against the Browns?
Andre Ellington, RB, Arizona Cardinals – Gets going in the passing game out of the backfield against San Fran?
Jeremy Hill, RB, Cincinnati Bengals – Cheap TD against the Browns?
Chris Ivory, RB, Jacksonville Jaguars – Cheap TD against the Jets?
Geronimo Allison, WR, Green Bay Packers – Only if Randall Cobb is out again.
Devin Funchess, WR, Carolina Panthers – With Olsen out and Benjamin hurting, Funchess should be able to build on 4-58 last week and 4-68 the prior week.
Brandon Marshall, WR, New York Giants – Two catches in two weeks and then 8. Without a ground game, he could continue to see targets.
Jordan Matthews, WR, Buffalo Bills – Will he finally break out for the Bills? They’ll likely have to pass more playing from behind against Atlanta.
Paul Richardson, WR, Seattle Seahawks – Doug Baldwin is hurting. Could Richardson pick up some slack against the Colts?
Vernon Davis, TE, Washington Redskins – Solid option if Jordan Reed is out again.
Zach Miller, TE, Chicago Bears – Will be playing from behind against the Pack, which should mean more looks.
Benjamin Watson, TE, Baltimore Ravens – Two solid games in a row. Can he put up another one against the Steelers?
Cincinnati Bengals Defense – Cleveland should make the Bengals a nice streaming option.
Cleveland Browns – If Cincy plays like the first two weeks, this is a nice value pick.

CDN – http://www.conservativedailynews.com
“I think we’re more likely to see them in something new,” I replied. “Perhaps an organization similar to Beck’s ‘The Blaze’” with more focus on video/streaming content.
I don’t think Rush wants to do TV at all, but O’Reilly and Bolling do. But it may be awhile before Eric is ready to jump back in after the recent loss of his son.
The imaginary new offering could probably pull in Jenna Lee as a known news anchor and perhaps some other up-and-coming news talent from local stations to keep it from being all opinion shows. Steven Crowder, Gavin McInnes, and Michelle Malkin might be interesting on panels or as co-hosts, but I’m not sure they have the chops to Host an hour-long show on their own.
Stefan Molyneux is entertaining and educational in his podcasts, not sure about TV host though. Maybe?
Would also be cool if they entertained the idea of bringing in MRC’s Brent Bozell to cover the media and Joe Bastardi for weather – similar to how Fox uses Janice Dean.
Contributors should include James Woods, Charlie Kirk, Nigel Farage, Scott Adams, Buck Sexton, Katie Pavlich, Dan Bongino, Allen West, Larry Elder, Dennis Miller and Nick Gillespie.

3142,Shania Twain and Tom Petty hit the charts,"Image copyright Getty Images
Country star Shania Twain has beaten Wolf Alice to number one, in the closest chart battle of the year.
Just 764 sales separated the two acts, with Wolf Alice ceding an early lead to the Canadian star.
Twain's album Now is her first since 2002, and comes after a period where she struggled with debilitating vocal problems.
US rock star Tom Petty also returned to the chart this week, after his sudden death on Monday at the age of 66.
His 1993 greatest hits album, which features songs like Free Fallin', American Girl and Refugee, re-entered the Top 40 at number 14.
Image copyright Reuters Image caption Tributes were left on the star of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers on the Hollywood Walk of Fame
Other new entries this week came from pop acts Demi Lovato (number five), Miley Cyrus (eight) and Hurts (21).
The long build-up to Christmas also started to exert its influence, with compilations by David Bowie, Michael Jackson and Feeder entering the chart, alongside a live album from Pink Floyd star David Gilmour.
Twain's chart battle with Wolf Alice came with a side-helping of celebrity endorsements, with Jeremy Corbyn petitioning his supporters to buy the London indie band's latest record, Visions Of A Life.
""After helping Labour beat the odds in the election, it's great to see @WolfAliceMusic doing the same in the charts,"" he wrote on Twitter, along with a link to their online store.
Twain, on the other hand, won the support of former One Direction star (and labelmate at Virgin EMI) Niall Horan.

In the singles chart, Sam Smith was knocked off the number one spot by US rapper Post Malone.
His song, Rockstar, swapped places with Smith's ballad Too Good At Goodbyes, which dropped to number two.
Love Island stars Chris and Kem scored the week's biggest new entry with Little Bit Leave It.
Despite hopes it could top the chart earlier this week, its sales tailed off and the duo ended up at number 15.

A few notes, thoughts and links to previous articles on Gang Green to pass along:
It’s not exactly time to put anyone in Canton after just three games, but the play of the Jets’ rookie safeties have been extremely impressive through two games, especially in coverage. Jamal Adams hasn’t allowed a completion since week one and PFF provided this stat on fellow rookie Marcus Maye earlier today
Marcus Maye played 46 coverage snaps against MIA. He wasn’t targeted once. On the season: 107 cov snaps, 3 targets, 29 yds allowed #Jets — PFF NY Jets (@PFF_NYJets) September 25, 2017
As much as Jets fans knock the play of Matt Forte, he has outperformed Bilal Powell over the past two games, averaging 4.6 yards per carry to Powell’s 2.4. Rookie running back Elijah McGuire has posted an average of 4.8 YPC during that same time period.
You have to tip your cap to Leonard Williams and the rest of the defensive line for an incredible effort on Sunday. There may not have been big sack numbers, but the unit did pressure Jay Cutler while holding Jay Ajayi to 16 yards on 11 carries. Even Mo Wilkerson, who had just one tackle, looked better than he has all season.
If for no other reason, those fans who can attend this week’s game against the Jaguars should do so to honor the great Kevin Mawae, who will be inducted in to the team’s ring of honor.
More important than just getting a win this past Sunday was the fact that so many of the Jets’ young players stood out on both sides of the ball. Take a look at our list here .
. If Brian Winters misses any more time and Dakota Dozier continues to play well in his place, it’s not a good look for Mike Maccagnan who gave Winters a huge contract this off season to avoid having Winters hit free agency.
Defensive lineman Lawrence Thomas got some run at fullback on Sunday.
Defensive lineman Lawrence Thomas played a bit of fullback against the Dolphins, and if you’re wondering if he may see a carry from time to time, it appears unlikely as the Michigan State Spartans used him exclusively as a blocker and receiver in his one season out of the backfield for the Spartans. But….never say never.
For the third week in a row, outside linebacker Jordan Jenkins turned in an impressive performance and seems to have picked up where he left off last season. The same can’t be said for Juston Burris who played well in the opener, but has struggled since.
After facing Marshawn Lynch and Jay Ajayi in back-to-back weeks, it won’t get any easier for the Jets defense as they prepare to take on rookie battering ram Leonard Fournette. After an incredible performance against the Dolphins (11 solo tackles, 3 tackles for loss), Demario Davis and his partner in crime, Darron Lee, may be tested up the middle once again.
Only five days ’til game day, folks!

At least 13 people have now died in fast-spreading fires that are ravaging parts of California's wine region.
A state of emergency was declared in northern areas after mass evacuations, with 2,000 structures destroyed.
About 20,000 people fled from Napa, Sonoma and Yuba counties in response to some the state's worst-ever wildfires.
Such fires are more common in southern California but a combination of dry weather and strong winds has fuelled the destruction in the north.

Cal Fire officials said on Tuesday morning that 17 wildfires in nine counties have burned more than 115,000 acres in just the past 12 hours.

""These fires have destroyed structures and continue to threaten thousands of homes, necessitating the evacuation of thousands of residents,"" Governor Jerry Brown said.
President Donald Trump has approved a disaster declaration for the fire-ravaged state, allowing federal emergency aid to be sent.
There is little sign the weather in the coming days will bring much relief to firefighters, BBC Weather says. More tinder dry conditions are forecast, with no rain expected.
Meanwhile, in southern California, a separate wildfire burnt 24 homes or other buildings in the wealthy Anaheim Hills area of Orange County, forcing thousands of residents to evacuate.

What do we know of the loss of life and damage?
The fires - considered among the deadliest in state history - have sent smoke as far south as San Francisco, located about 60 miles (96km) away.
A new fire is reportedly burning near the Oakmont area of Santa Rosa, a city that has already been devastated by the blazes.
Hundreds of homes have been destroyed in the city by flames so hot that glass melted on cars.
Details of how the seven people died in Sonoma were not immediately available, but country sheriff Rob Giordano said he expected the death toll to rise.
""There is a lot of burned homes and a lot of burned areas, so it's just logical that we're gonna find more people,"" he said.
Two people also died in Napa county and one in Mendocino county when thousands of acres burned in one valley.
Sonoma County officials said they had received more than 150 missing-person reports by Tuesday.
Authorities said they have found a few of the missing persons but most of the reports were still under investigation, Sonoma County spokesman Scott Alonso said.
Dozens of vineyard workers were reportedly airlifted to safety overnight.

Wineries belonging to the rich and famous were abandoned. One belonging to musician Dave Matthews was closed and at risk of being burned to the ground, staff said, as was the nearby Francis Ford Coppola Winery.
The vine harvest is already under way and many of the grapes have been picked.
Why did the fires spread so fast?
It is not yet known how the fires started on Sunday night but such blazes are particularly fast-spreading because of a combination of 60mph 96km/h) winds, low humidity and hot, dry weather.

Ken Moholt-Siebert, a vineyard owner who thought his property had probably been destroyed after he and his family escaped on Sunday night, described the suddenness of the disaster.
""There was no wind, then there would be a rush of wind and it would stop. Then there would be another gust from a different direction. The flames wrapped around us,"" he told the LA Times.

362,Srebrenica defender Naser Oric cleared of war crimes in Sarajevo,"Image copyright AFP Image caption Naser Oric was extradited to Bosnia-Herzegovina from Switzerland
Former Bosnian Muslim commander Naser Oric has been acquitted of war crimes by a court in Sarajevo.
Mr Oric and another military veteran, Sabahudin Muhic, were cleared of killing three Bosnian Serb prisoners near Srebrenica in 1992.
He was arrested in Switzerland in 2015 on a Serbian warrant but extradited to his country to face charges.
Many Bosnian Muslims consider him a hero for leading the defence of Srebrenica during the 1992-95 war.
However, families of Bosnian Serbs killed in the war - who see Mr Oric and his troops as criminals - walked out of the Sarajevo court in protest at its judgement on Monday, Reuters reported.
In 2006, Mr Oric was convicted by the international war crimes tribunal in The Hague of failing to prevent men under his command killing and mistreating Bosnian Serb prisoners in 1992-93. He was freed as he had already spent more than three years in jail.
His conviction was quashed on appeal in 2008.
The latest court case also related to crimes alleged to have taken place several years before the Srebrenica massacre.
In July 1995, in what was supposed to have been a UN safe haven, Bosnian Serb forces took control of Srebrenica. They rounded up and killed about 8,000 men and boys and buried them in mass graves.",fake

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Indian Oil Corp, the country’s largest refiner, has bought two new types of U.S. crude for December delivery as it tests different grades from the United States, trade sources said on Tuesday.
IOC bought 1 million barrels each of U.S. Southern Green Canyon (SGC) and WTI Midland crude likely from a Chinese trader, the people said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The purchase was in addition to 2 million barrels of Basra Light crude to be delivered in the same month.
The United States has become a new source of crude supply for Asia since Washington lifted a ban on crude exports in late 2015. India joined other Asian countries in buying U.S. crude in the fourth quarter to widen its import sources as well as to reduce trade surplus with the United States.
IOC has issued another sour crude tender that will close later this week to purchase more oil for the same period, according to a document reviewed by Reuters.
Officials at IOC weren’t available for comment.
The refiner has bought about 5.5 million barrels of U.S. crude so far this year.
Other Indian refiners to have bought U.S. crude include Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd, Bharat Oman Refinery, Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd and Reliance Industries Ltd.",fake

Miller was a Middle East negotiator in Democratic and Republican administrations. Follow him @aarondmiller2 . Richard Sokolsky is a non-resident senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace . From 2005-2015, he served as a member of the Secretary of State's Office of Policy Planning. The views expressed in this commentary are their own.
(CNN) Secretary of State Rex Tillerson made a remarkable statement on Wednesday, rejecting reports he had considered resigning and reaffirming his commitment to the President's domestic and foreign policies. This was both stunning and unprecedented. It was not quite a hostage video, but it seemed awkward that a secretary of state felt compelled to defend himself in response to a press report.
Indeed, Tillerson has good instincts on many foreign policy issues and is ready to provide independent advice. But his road ahead won't be easy, particularly given that Donald Trump is ready and willing to undercut him.
Still, Tillerson clearly doesn't plan to resign, despite an NBC report that he referred to the President as a "" moron "" -- a claim his spokeswoman denies. And even if he did, it might not matter much who succeeded him. Unless the bureaucratic environment in Trumpland changes, his successor will likely confront the same challenges Tillerson is facing now.
So, what are these challenges?
First, our decades of experience in the Department of State allow us to report that the dynamic playing out now between the President and Tillerson has not existed before in modern US foreign policy history. Granted, Tillerson has not helped himself. He was not necessarily the President's first choice, lacks Washington experience, has an aversion to the media and has some misplaced priorities in how he has tried to reform the State Department.
But none of this can explain the current level of dysfunction that exists between the two. Secretaries of state and presidents have argued privately before over process and substance. But it's rare -- indeed unprecedented -- that these differences surface publicly. In the modern period, only two secretaries of state have resigned over principle: William Jennings Bryan in 1915, over Woodrow Wilson's policies toward Germany in the run-up to World War I, and Cyrus Vance in 1980, in opposition to Jimmy Carter's efforts to rescue the American hostages in Iran.
And that there is serious talk of Tillerson's resignation less than 10 months into his tenure is shocking. Since the 1950s, only two secretaries of state have had significantly abbreviated tenures: Edmund Muskie, who served out the remainder of Vance's term, and Alexander Haig, who left early because of inter-cabinet tensions generated by his brash style. While Muskie served just shy of a year, Haig served for a year and a half before his departure.
Second, that the President would mishandle and undermine his secretary of state at a time when the world is filled with foreign policy challenges -- indeed crises that require 24/7 focus and attention -- is also without precedent. And whatever Tillerson's flaws and failings, when it comes to matters of substance, such as recertifying the Iran deal, not picking sides in the Saudi-Qatar cold war, or probing diplomatic options on North Korea, his instincts are far sounder than the President's.
And yet Trump has consistently undermined -- even humiliated -- his top diplomat on these issues, most recently tweeting that Tillerson was wasting his time on North Korea. It would be one thing if the President were experienced in foreign policy or had other advisers who had both experience and influence on these issues. Both Secretary of Defense James Mattis and National Security Adviser HR McMaster have plenty of experience (though in national security and war-making -- not in diplomacy). But even their influence is limited.
President Richard Nixon and National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger cut Secretary of State William Rogers out of many of the decisions on China and the Middle East. But they had the experience to make foreign policy decisions. Unfortunately, there is no other go-to person with diplomatic experience in Trump's administration.
Third, whatever responsibility Tillerson bears for his own misfortunes, he simply cannot function effectively as the nation's top diplomat unless the President makes it unmistakably clear that the secretary of state is his sole repository of authority and public voice when it comes to foreign policy. It takes Washington and the world all of five seconds to figure out when there's daylight between the two. And once that's established, you might as well hang a ""closed for the season"" sign on the secretary's door.

The truth is Trump has not even tried to grant Tillerson this kind of authority. In fact, he has done the opposite, assigning key foreign policy briefs to others -- such as Jared Kushner, who is charged with handling the Arab-Israeli negotiations -- and allowed individuals, including UN Ambassador Nikki Haley, to speak on a variety of issues -- from Iran to Syria -- as a de facto secretary of state.
Finally, we'd argue that even if Tillerson departed, it might not change much. The challenge for any secretary of state is the diminishing role of the State Department as the Defense Department and National Security Council play larger roles. (The other challenge is in confronting the cruel and unforgiving world, which has problems seemingly without solutions.)
But the real dysfunction begins at the top. And we wonder whether personal and substantive differences may have reached a point of no return. The combination of a thin-skinned President and reports like Tillerson's alleged ""moron"" comment, combined with substantive differences on a variety of foreign policy issues, may have compromised Tillerson's effectiveness.
We hope not. But we increasingly wonder whether there's really room for Tillerson in the volatile world that's Trumpland.",fake

Here… let me “All Caps” it for the people with iffy eyesight…JOE GIRARDI IS A BETTER MANAGER THAN JOE TORRE. Now, just like when Joba snapped at Mariano I’m sure a good deal of you feel like I just insulted the Pope. I didn’t. This is an opinion. It’s my opinion, and it’s one that I feel very strongly about.
I’m a Joe Girardi fan (Please note I love Mr. T as well and think the world of him as a person.) and I believe GI Joe is the better Skipper. No, he is not good with the media. No, he isn’t flashy. Nope, he ain’t even a born, bred New Yorker…ya know what? He is an OUTSTANDING manager and a big reason the Yankees are where they are.
Joe Torre was a genius at keeping talented, high priced, inflated egos in check, but he was always getting those type of players. He had the Core 4 in their prime. He saw the best Bronx Bomber team since Murder’s Row win…and win and win and win. How’d he do before King George hired him to replace Buck? (Who, like him or not, did a lot of heavy lifting to build the Yankees.) How’d he do when he went “Hollywood”? Joe was great for the Yankees…but he isn’t the manager Girardi is. If you are letting go the pinstriped blinders for a minute and being honest with yourself I think you may see what I’m saying.

Yankee fans have a way of taking the glory years and making them seem untouchable. Joe Torre was good, Joe Girardi is better. He backs up his guys. He KNOWS the game (You can take a walk with all the Binder nonsense). Joe is a brilliant guy. You don’t graduate from Northwestern with an Engineering degree because you had a library card and a pulse. Joe knows Baseball more than you do…YEP! Even you. You sitting on your couch watching the game, ready to tweet your displeasure with the Yankee Skipper because he gave the starter the hook and went to Betances. Joe knows how to develop kids.

3298,Chess in a black box: China's five most powerful people,"(CNN) Unlike the gossipy, open democracies of Western societies, it is almost impossible to know who truly holds power in the opaque world of Chinese politics.
The country is ruled by the Chinese Communist Party, in a one-party system, making whoever occupies the highest positions in the party among the most powerful.
Power isn't just held by the politicians either -- influential businessmen and entrepreneurs, the pioneers of China's economic rise, are also fighting for a seat at the table.
As Beijing gets ready for the biggest event in China's political calendar, the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party on October 18, we polled 10 experts, asking them to pick who they thought were the top five most powerful people in China.
Their answers on who really pulls the strings were varied, and shed light on the upcoming Congress -- akin to a closed-door election when China's next generation leaders are expected to be unveiled.
Here's who makes up the top five, according to the policy advisers, academics and journalists we spoke to.
5. Li Keqiang
In theory, Premier Li is number two in China's power structure, but his influence is far from assured.
In 2012, he was appointed as the head of government in China, taking over as Premier and second only to Xi Jinping on the all-powerful Politburo Standing Committee.
""The general manager of the second largest economy in the world, he has dealt with the complex economic, social, and technological transformation of the largest country in the world,"" China politics expert Zhiyue Bo told CNN, who placed Li third on his list.
So why is he so far down the overall list?
""He's regarded as being a sort of low-profile, not particularly interlinked or interconnected premier. He's got probably the worst job in China. The premier is always going to be taking the rap for stuff,"" Kerry Brown, professor of Chinese politics at King's College London, told CNN.
A former governor of Henan province who earned a doctorate in economics at Peking University, Prime Minister Li was a protege of former President Hu Jintao and rose to power through Hu's power base in the Communist Youth League.
Brown added many of Li's patronage networks, such as the Youth League faction, are believed to have lost their power under Xi Jinping, whose base is mostly made up of the children of former party leaders, or ""princelings.""
""Of course he's got the State Council (the country's primary administrative authority and chaired by Li), of course he's influential, he's trying to get things done, but it's not a sort of political power. It's administrative power,"" he said.
""Power is about initiating, setting frameworks, setting the agenda. Well you can see people doing that, but Li Keqiang is more of an administrator.""
4. Ma Huateng
Living in China, there's only one app you must have on your phone -- because every other person has it.
In a country without Facebook or Twitter, WeChat is a combination of both -- and much more -- and wildly popular.
The company's founder, Ma Huateng, is China's third richest man, according to Forbes , just behind Jack Ma and Dalian Wanda founder Wang Jianlin.
""He wields massive influence because of the ubiquitous use of WeChat ... Several powerful business leaders have had their wings clipped in recent years, but the technology sector has so far escaped relatively unscathed,"" said Tom Rafferty, China regional manager for the Economist Intelligence Unit, who ranked Ma third on his list.
Ma, who is also known by his nickname ""Pony,"" founded Tencent, the company which owns WeChat, in 1998 with his university classmates. Two decades later, he is now the company's chairman and its value has skyrocketed.
Tencent's app, WeChat, is currently the largest and most commonly used messaging system in the world, with almost 1 billion users.
""(China's internet kingpins) have been able to leverage the potential for China to internationalize its internet behemoths to make sure that it remains part of the global internet community -- even with huge restrictions on that global status,"" Rana Mitter, director of the University China Center at Oxford University, said, placing Ma second in his ranking.
It is those restrictions which make working in the world of China's internet so complex and potentially dangerous. Under Xi Jinping, China's Great Firewall is rising higher than ever and new restrictions and censorship on the country's online community are increasing by the day.
""One challenge for tech titans like Ma in the coming years is whether they can keep on the good side of the authorities, as their wealth and influence continue to expand,"" said Rafferty.
3. Wang Qishan
Shortly after taking power in 2012, President Xi boldly announced he was going to tackle China's endemic corruption, warning both low and high-level officials, or ""flies and tigers"" in Chinese parlance, they would be in his sights.
For his tiger hunter, Xi chose former Beijing mayor and 2008 Olympics organizer Wang Qishan.
Since then, Wang has grown to be a powerful, feared figure among Chinese officials.
He's brought down his share of tigers, including the formerly untouchable security tzar Zhou Yongkang and, recently, Chongqing party secretary Sun Zhengcai, a member of China's mighty Politburo and once rumored to be a candidate to succeed Xi.
Rafferty said Wang is often described as the ""second-most powerful"" politician in China.
""He's been an essential lieutenant for Xi ... the president would be a weakened force without him at the top table,"" he said, placing Wang second.
As a result of Xi and Wang's crackdown, conspicuous spending and flaunting of wealth by officials has shrunk dramatically and as a result, Wang's political capital has continued to rise.
But Wang's rise could be complicated by his age. He'll be 69 at the upcoming 19th Party Congress, meaning by custom he should retire.
Additionally, two analysts who didn't rank Wang said his position had been weakened by unproven allegations from exiled businessman Guo Wengui, who has used social media to hurl accusations at China's top leaders from the safety of the US.
Minglu Chen, senior lecturer at the University of Sydney, said while the substance of Guo's claims may or may not be true, they came at a potentially damaging time for the vice-premier, potentially empowering his enemies in the lead up to the conference.
2. Jack Ma
On the surface, he's the flamboyant and personable former English teacher who likes to dance to Michael Jackson tunes.
But Jack Ma is without a doubt one of China's most powerful people and possibly the country's most public face internationally next to President Xi.
Ma, whose Chinese name is Ma Yun, is the executive chairman and founder of Alibaba, China's powerhouse e-commerce site, as well as owning other massive online shopping platforms like Taobao.
His online platforms rake in hundreds of billions of dollars, making him the richest man in China as of September 2017.
Ma has met one-on-one with two US presidents, both Barack Obama and Donald Trump, and single-handedly created a national shopping holiday in China, ""Single's Day"" on November 11.
""(Ma) has displayed vision and gusto in expanding his e-commerce empire,"" Willy Lam, adjunct professor at Center for China Studies at Chinese University of Hong Kong, told CNN, who placed Ma third on his list.
""Even more striking is his determination to leverage Alibaba's massive earnings to spearhead research in high-tech, particularly AI, cloud computing, ""deep learning"" and related know-how.""
But in China no one is untouchable. Just recently billionaire property tycoon Wang Jianlin, Ma's peer on the China rich list, has had to abandon a series of major international deals after coming under scrutiny from Beijing
""Political power trumps everything and anything in the party state,"" Chen told CNN.
But Ma isn't worried, if we put stock in one of his most famous quotes:
""Today is very cruel, tomorrow is crueler. Day after tomorrow is beautiful. Most people can't see the day after tomorrow.""
1. Xi Jinping
When contacted for our piece, Jeffrey Wasserstrom, professor of history at University of California, Irvine, said he wasn't able to pick five different power players in China.
""The five most powerful people are the head of the party, the president, the commander in chief, the author of the book that gets the best display spots in the bookstores these days, and the guy the People's Daily hails as China's most astute commentator on globalization -- in other words Xi, Xi, Xi, Xi, and Xi,"" Wasserstrom told CNN.
China's president and, more importantly, the general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, analysts say Xi is already the country's most powerful leader since Paramount Leader Deng Xiaoping in the 1980s and 1990s.
Now with the upcoming Party Congress set to further cement his hold over the Communist Party, Xi's power is only set to grow.
""The President and General Secretary has managed to concentrate more power and demote more rivals than any of his predecessors managed,"" Mitter said, who along with each of the 10 analysts ranked Xi number one.
""That doesn't mean all his opponents are gone,"" Mitter said. ""The next few years will show just how much he can make use of the power he has accumulated.""
A chess game
Perry Link, emeritus professor of East Asian studies at Princeton University, told CNN it was almost impossible to pick the top five most powerful people in China and projecting the mechanics of Western democracies onto China was misleading.
In total, our 10 experts gave us 24 different names who they considered China's most powerful men and women.
Only seven people appeared on more than one list -- the top five as well as Li Zhanshu, director of the Chinese Communist Party General Office , and Guo Wengui, the US-based businessman and perennial thorn in the side of the Chinese Communist Party.
Events of October's party congress in Beijing could change everything -- Wang Qishan could be forced to retire or Li Keqiang might even lose his number two position, the experts said.
But Link said it was impossible to know the thought processes and motivations of China's most powerful men and women given the secretive nature of the Chinese system.
""What people really think is opaque beneath the chess game that they play, and the chess game itself goes on inside a highly impenetrable black box,"" he said.",fake
3092,Dozens pray at Hindu temple on slopes of Bali volcano,"Dozens prayed at a revered Hindu temple on the slopes of Bali's menacing Mount Agung volcano on Thursday, hoping the gods will restore it to calm.
Worshippers including Bali's governor, Made Mangkupastika, made offerings and recited prayers at the temple inside a zone declared off-limits by disaster officials.
Warnings that the volcano on the Indonesian tourist island could erupt anytime have caused 140,000 people to flee to safer areas.
""Despite Mount Agung being on the highest level of alert, this ceremony must be done,"" said Jro Mangku Jana, a Hindu priest.
""We pray for our safety and peace. Be thankful to God for all of his blessings to all of us,"" he said.
Prayers were also performed in other parts of the island by Hindus, Muslims and Christians, according to Bali's religious leader, Gusti Ngurah Sudiana.
Bali is the only predominantly Hindu province in Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim country.
Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said tremors from the volcano, which indicate rising magma, have remained at high levels since Agung's alert status was raised to the highest on Sept. 22.
He said a fracture has opened inside the volcano's crater and white smoke was spewing with weak pressure. An exclusion zone around the mountain extends as far as 12 kilometers (7.5 miles) from the crater in places.
Agung, about 70 kilometers (45 miles) to the northeast of the tourist hotspot of Kuta, is among more than 120 active volcanoes in Indonesia.
Another volcano, Mount Sinabung on Sumatra, has been erupting sporadically since 2010, sometimes blasting volcanic ash several kilometers (miles) into the air and forcing more than 30,000 to evacuate their villages.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific ""Ring of Fire,"" an arc of volcanoes and fault lines encircling the Pacific Basin, and is prone to seismic upheaval.",fake
1435,Google’s New Gadgets Come With a Big Helping of A.I.,"Google executives said it has been getting harder to find new hardware breakthroughs like bigger and better screens, but they believe significant improvements will come from artificial intelligence software that is developing at a faster clip than physical components.
Rick Osterloh, Google’s senior vice president of hardware, compared the company’s strategy for building devices to search and email. Google was not the first search engine and Gmail was hardly the first free web-based email provider — but both services reimagined what those products should do.
Last year, the company started its “Made By Google” line of hardware products, headlined by the Pixel smartphone. The handset received positive reviews, but it did not threaten the premium smartphone dominance of Apple or Samsung.

On Wednesday, Google demonstrated how every hardware product had received an A.I. makeover. The Pixel smartphones come with an image-recognition app called Lens that can help users find information just by pointing a camera at a movie poster or an ad. The new “smart speaker” uses artificial intelligence to adjust its sound for the layout of a room. And new wireless headphones allow for instant translation of different languages.
The question of Google’s commitment to hardware is a testament to the challenges of competing against devices made by Apple, Amazon and Samsung. Most other companies have found it hard to turn a profit in that product fight, and a flop can follow a company around for years — both in money and reputation lost.
It is also a recognition of Google’s history of fits and starts with devices. The company once acquired Motorola, only to sell it a few years later to Lenovo. It bought Nest and Dropcam, but the introduction of new products from those home device companies seemed to stagnate after they joined Google, now operating under the parent company, Alphabet.
Whether Google’s device push sticks over the long haul remains to be seen, but its checkbook for hardware is still open.
Last month, Google said it had agreed to acquire a team of 2,000 engineers from the Taiwanese manufacturer HTC for $1.1 billion. The hardware-focused personnel came from an HTC research and development division that was already working with Google to create the Pixel phones. Google said the acquisition will allow it to move faster in its efforts to develop new features for smartphones.
The deal is expected to close, pending regulatory approval, early next year.",fake
1655,"EU weakens plan on bank protection, risks ECB clash on bad loans","A general view shows the European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker addressing the European Parliament during a debate on The State of the European Union in Strasbourg, France, September 13, 2017. REUTERS/Christian Hartmann
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission proposed on Wednesday watered-down measures to help guard European Union banks against future crises, after two years of fruitless talks among the 28 EU states on more ambitious plans.
The new proposals were designed to win over Germany, the EU’s largest economy and the staunchest opponent of sharing banking risks among EU states, but the German banking lobby quickly dismissed them.
The proposals could also slow the European Central Bank’s plans to reduce the exposure of banks to bad loans. Shares of Italian banks rose, since they would face big losses if the EU mandated they quickly unload bad debts.
The Commission proposal would reduce the sharing of banking risks and set strict conditions that states must meet before their banks gain access to safety nets funded at the EU level.
Those changes were intended to placate Germany, whose departing finance minister, Wolfgang Schaeuble, repeatedly argued that sharing risks meant richer German banks would prop up weaker banks in other EU countries. His successor may be equally dubious.
The plan, revealed by Reuters last week, discards earlier proposals for full-fledged European insurance of savers if banks fail, leaving the burden largely with individual member states.
EU rules guarantee deposits up to 100,000 euros ($118,000), a provision meant to strengthen confidence in the region’s banks after a decade-long crisis that has seen the bailout of several top banks.
But existing national schemes to insure depositors are considered insufficient to cope with a major banking crisis. An EU backstop, funded by all banks in the bloc, is considered the best guarantee to protect savers and increase market confidence.
UMBRELLA WITH HOLES?
Under the new proposals, a European Deposit Insurance Scheme (EDIS) would intervene only after national schemes had spent all the money they had available.
In an initial phase, EDIS would lend to national insurers only enough to cover 30 percent of their losses. That would increase in stages to 90 percent in 2021.
In a second phase, EDIS would directly cover depositors’ losses, but only partly. National insurance schemes would continue to bear the brunt of a banking crisis.
The beginning of the second phase would not be automatic but would depend on banks’ ability to clean up their balance sheets and dispose of bad loans.
But the German banking lobby DK said the plan was “only a marginal advance” and urged measures to clean up bank balance sheets before the first phase began.
Non-performing loans (NPLs) in EU banks are decreasing, but still amount to nearly 1 trillion euros ($1.18 trillion), mostly at lenders in southern euro zone countries.
The Commission said it would make new legislative proposals by spring to address the NPLs problem, including measures to revamp a secondary market for bad loans and to favor banks’ recovery of soured credit, such as mortgages.
It will also consider possible legislative measures on “minimum levels of provisioning which banks must make for future NPLs arising from newly originated loans.”
The Commission document did not mention stricter provisions for existing bad loans, an omission that pushed Italian banks’ stocks up, traders said.
Italy’s bank index .FTIT8300 was up 0.9 percent by 1445 GMT, outperforming a 0.3 percent decline in the pan-European banking index .SX7P after the Commission’s proposal.
Italian banks sold off over the past week after the European Central Bank disclosed plans to require lenders to set aside more money on new bad loans from next year and considered moves to reduce the existing stock of bad loans.
CLASH WITH ECB?
The Commission’s aims match the ECB plan, but a parallel process could slow things down. EU legislative proposals require the backing of EU states and parliamentarians, a process that usually takes months or years before rules enter into force.
Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis told a news conference he expected the ECB to take into account opinions of other institutions and market participants before adopting any measure.
He also said that legislators and supervisors have different powers and the ECB could intervene to address risks on specific banks.
The president of the European Parliament, Antonio Tajani, urged the ECB to involve the parliament in decisions on bad loans.
Italy has criticized the ECB move, urging a more gradual reduction of bad loans to avoid creating large holes in bank balance sheets. Germany has supported the ECB move.
But an EU legislator close to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Markus Ferber, attacked the ECB on Wednesday, saying it lacked “modesty” with its NPL plans.
“I do not want to see the ECB creating a parallel regime of capital requirements that bypasses the legislator,” he said.",fake

(The Sports Xchange) - Highlights of Sunday’s Major League Baseball playoff games:
- - -
Yankees 1, Indians 0
Greg Bird led off the bottom of the seventh inning with a homer, and Aroldis Chapman posted a five-out save as the New York Yankees staved off elimination Sunday night with a 1-0 victory over the Cleveland Indians in Game 3 of the American League Division Series.
Bird helped the Yankees force Game 4 on Monday night when he lifted a 95 mph fastball on a 1-1 count from left-hander Andrew Miller (0-1) about halfway up in the second deck in right field.
It was only the second homer allowed by Miller to a left-handed hitter this season.
After Miller gave up Bird’s homer, David Robertson recorded the first out of the eighth but walked Michael Brantley, earning a hook from manager Joe Girardi.
Chapman struck out pinch hitter Yan Gomes on a 102 mph fastball after making three pickoff attempts at first on pinch runner Greg Allen. The left-hander ended the eighth by blowing a 102 mph fastball by Giovanny Urshela.
With one out in the ninth, Chapman gave up a single to Jason Kipnis and an infield hit to Jose Ramirez, putting runners at first and second. Chapman secured the win by fanning Jay Bruce and retiring Carlos Santana on a fly ball to deep center field.
Masahiro Tanaka (1-0) scattered three hits in seven outstanding innings. He struck out seven, walked one, threw 92 pitches, induced two double plays and received defensive help from right fielder Aaron Judge.
Cleveland’s Carlos Carrasco, who missed last year’s postseason recovering from a hand injury, allowed three hits in 5 2/3 scoreless innings but exited after loading the bases in the sixth.
Cleveland’s first real threat occurred in the fourth inning when Kipnis tripled to deep right field. Judge’s misplay of the ball (he was not given an error) featured him kicking the ball toward right-center field as Kipnis sped into third base.
Tanaka rebounded by striking out Jose Ramirez and Bruce.
The Yankees got their first hit when Didi Gregorius singled up the middle but he was stranded when Castro chased a breaking ball for Carrasco’s sixth strikeout to end the fourth.
The Indians threatened again in the fifth when Carlos Santana led off with a walk and Austin Jackson fouled off four consecutive pitches. Tanaka used his curveball to retire Jackson on a fly ball to the warning track in right field before getting a double play three pitches later.

Boston staved off elimination with a one-sided victory over Houston in Game Three of their American League Division Series.
Game Four is in Boston on Monday with Houston, which leads the best-of-five series 2-1, trying to close out the Red Sox.
Rafael Devers hit a go-ahead two-run home run, the first of the 20-year-old’s postseason career, in the third inning to give the Red Sox a 4-3 lead, their first of the series.
Devers, who finished with three runs batted in, became the youngest Red Sox player ever (20 years, 349 days) to hit a home run in a playoff game and just the sixth player in major league history to homer in the postseason before turning 21.
Jackie Bradley Jr. hit a three-run homer, also his first career playoff blast, while Hanley Ramirez went 4-for-4 with three RBIs and Sandy Leon drove in another run for the Red Sox.
Slideshow (2 Images)
Boston received four shutout innings of relief and four strikeouts from David Price to keep them in front in a close game early on. Joe Kelly (1-0) earned the win with 1 2/3 scoreless innings in relief of starter Doug Fister.
Carlos Correa hit a two-run homer, his second of the series, and Josh Reddick added an RBI for the Astros.
Fister was pulled after giving up three runs in 1 1/3 innings, marking the shortest postseason outing for a Red Sox starter since Bret Saberhagen (one inning) on Oct. 11, 1999.
Fister allowed four hits, walked one and struck out one.
Houston starter Brad Peacock departed after 2 2/3 innings having allowed three runs on six hits with one walk and four strikeouts in his first career postseason appearance.
Astros reliever Francisco Liriano (0-1) gave up the go-ahead homer to Devers and took the loss.
Houston enjoyed another fast start against a shaky Fister, scoring three runs in the first inning.
Reddick’s RBI single two batters into the game opened the scoring and was followed by Correa’s blast of approximately 385 feet to center field the next at-bat to make it 3-0.
Boston got one run back on Leon’s single with the bases loaded and nobody out in the second, but Peacock retired the next three batters to escape the jam.
Ramirez brought the Red Sox within a run on his two-out RBI single before Devers delivered his homer of an estimated 430 feet over the bullpens in right-center to put Boston ahead.
A bases-loaded single with nobody out in the seventh by Ramirez and a bloop RBI single from Devers the next at-bat put Boston ahead 7-3.
Bradley smacked his homer to right two batters later to make it 10-3.

Nearly two dozen blazes spanning eight counties have charred around 170,000 acres (68,797 hectares). Flames erupted on Sunday night when gale force winds toppled power lines across the region, possibly igniting one of the deadliest wildfire outbreaks in California history.
Flames were spread rapidly by hot, dry “Diablo” winds - similar to Southern California’s Santa Ana winds - that blew into northern California toward the Pacific on Sunday night.
The official cause of ignition has not been determined. But electric wires knocked down by those same winds may have sparked the conflagration, according to Daniel Berlant, spokesman for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire).
”That is definitely a possibility, he told Reuters. “Power lines are a common cause of fires during wind events.”
Berlant said some of the victims in northern California were asleep when the fast-moving fires broke out, igniting their homes before they could escape.
At least 20,000 people remained under evacuation as the fires raged largely unchecked for a third day, belching palls of smoke that engulfed the region and drifted south over the San Francisco Bay area, where some residents donned face masks.
The entire town of Calistoga, a Napa Valley community of some 5,000 residents spared from advancing flames the first night of the fire, was ordered evacuated on Wednesday evening, as the county sheriff’s office warned that conditions had worsened.
More than 550 people were still reported unaccounted for in Sonoma County on Wednesday morning, said Jennifer Laroque, a county emergency operations center spokeswoman.
It was unclear how many of the missing might be actual fire victims rather than evacuees who merely failed to check in with authorities after fleeing their homes. Officials urged displaced residents to let their family members know they were safe.
OBLITERATED NEIGHBORHOODS
The Sonoma County town of Santa Rosa, the largest city in the wine country region, was particularly hard hit by one of the fiercest blazes, the so-called Tubbs fire. Block after block of some neighborhoods were virtually obliterated with nothing left but charred debris, broken walls, chimneys and the steel frames of burned-out cars.
“It’s like driving through a war zone,” J.J. Murphy, 22, one of thousands of evacuees, said of the area around his home in the Sonoma Valley community of Glen Ellen.
Murphy, five relatives, a bird, a dog and two cats piled into their camper van to flee on Monday, he said.

“It’s crazy how in just a few hours a place I’ve recognized all my life I can’t recognize,” he said at a roadside food stop in the town of Sonoma.
In the town of Napa on the first night of a blaze dubbed the Atlas fire, nearly 50 people who were in danger of being overrun by flames were rescued by the crews of two California Highway Patrol helicopters working in tandem during a seven-hour aerial evacuation operation.
The weather gave firefighters a bit of a respite on Tuesday as cooler temperatures, lower winds and coastal fog enabled them to make headway against the flames. Fire crews labored on Wednesday to strengthen containment lines as winds picked up again.
“We’re not out of the woods and we’re not going to be out of the woods for a great number of days to come,” Ken Pimlott, director of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire), said at a news conference.

In addition to high winds, fires were stoked by an abundance of thick brush and other vegetation left tinder dry by a summer of hot, dry weather and months with little or no rainfall. The cause of the fires remained under investigation.
Matt Nauman, a spokesman for the region’s main utility, Pacific Gas & Electric, acknowledged that fallen power lines were widespread during the “historic wind event,” which he said packed some hurricane-strength gusts in excess of 75 miles per hour.
FIRES ENTER RECORD BOOKS
At least 11 people were killed by the Tubbs fire in Sonoma County alone, officials said. It is the deadliest single California wildfire since 2003, when the so-called Cedar fire killed 15 people in San Diego, according to state data.
The latest overall death toll of 21, including six fatalities in Mendocino County and two more each in Napa and Yuba counties, marks the greatest loss of life from a California wildfire event in 26 years, since 25 people perished in a firestorm that swept the Oakland Hills in October 1991.
The deadliest wildfire on record in California dates back to October 1933, when 29 lives were lost in the Griffith Park fire in Los Angeles.
Officials identified the dead in Napa County as 100-year-old Charles Rippey and his 98-year-old wife, Sarah. His body was found outside where his wife’s bedroom once stood, their son, Mike Rippey, told local television.
“He was trying to get from his room to her room,” he said. “He never made it.”
Wildfires have damaged or demolished at least 13 Napa Valley wineries, a trade group for vintners there said on Tuesday. But experts say smoke rather than flames may pose a greater risk to the delicate grapes still waiting to be picked.

3457,Palestinian Rivals Talk Unity but Show Divisions,"Hamas says its maintenance of control over its “weapons of resistance” is nonnegotiable. But Mr. Abbas said he would not tolerate a Gaza version of “the Hezbollah model in Lebanon,” in which a heavily armed nonstate organization exerts influence over a weak government and hollowed-out national institutions.
“Reconciliation is something that none of the parties can afford,” said Ghassan Khatib, a Palestinian political scientist at Birzeit University in the West Bank.
“Hamas cannot change its politics in order to be part of the P.L.O.,” he said, referring to the Palestine Liberation Organization, the main Palestinian umbrella group also led by Mr. Abbas. At the same time, he said, “the P.L.O. cannot accept Hamas without it changing its policies, or it will lose its international recognition.”
Photo
In short, he concluded, “Hamas will not give up its military capabilities, its only source of power, and Abbas cannot accept the Lebanese model.”
Nevertheless, while numerous attempts at Palestinian unity have failed in the past, experts in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and Israel say this effort seems more serious. Hamas is under new leadership. The United States and other international players want to see the Palestinian Authority take charge of Gaza ahead of a possible resumption of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. And all the parties, including Israel, are growing increasingly concerned about the humanitarian situation there.
Only limited aid can flow to the area as long as Hamas, considered a terrorist group by Israel, the United States and the European Union, is in control. A new influx of foreign assistance through the Palestinian Authority and a new regime for Gaza’s border crossings with Israel and Egypt, allowing for more movement of people and goods could, analysts say, alleviate the suffering and prevent an explosion.
“The lowest common denominator that everyone agrees on is the deteriorating situation in Gaza,” Mr. Khatib said. “What is most probably going to happen is much, much less than reconciliation, but some little bit of progress beyond the current reality.”

Last week Israel allowed a large delegation of government and security officials from the Palestinian Authority, led by Prime Minister Rami Hamdallah, to pass through its territory to hold a ceremonial cabinet meeting in Gaza as an early display of unity.
Given the many complexities, some analysts said that any celebrations over Mr. Hamdallah’s arrival in Gaza may have been premature.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, for one, warned that Israel was “not interested in a bogus reconciliation in which the Palestinian factions reconcile with each other at the expense of our existence.” He insisted, among other things, on Hamas dismantling its military wing and recognizing Israel.
Palestinian observers pointed to other ominous signs, like Mr. Hamdallah’s swift departure from Gaza and an apparent lack of enthusiasm from Mr. Abbas, who has not yet canceled the economic sanctions he imposed on Gaza to force Hamas to yield control.
“Rami Hamdallah went there as a kind of visitor or tourist, as if Ban Ki-moon was visiting,” said Zakaria al-Qaq, a Palestinian expert in national security at Al Quds University in East Jerusalem, referring to the former secretary-general of the United Nations. “As the days go by, the Palestinian Authority is adding more conditions.”
Photo
At first, Mr. Qaq said, Mr. Abbas merely demanded the dismantling of Hamas’s shadow government. “Now,” he said, “they are saying they have to renegotiate everything and are talking about Hezbollah and Hamas.”
But even if Mr. Abbas is reluctant to act as a subcontractor in solving Gaza’s troubles, the Palestinian public has long demanded unity and Mr. Abbas has publicly committed to trying to achieve it, though his representatives say it is likely to take some time.
“This is a long process,” Azzam al-Ahmad, the head of the Fatah delegation to Cairo, told the official Voice of Palestine radio on Tuesday. “We will discuss elections, the judiciary, security, the P.L.O., all of these things.”
The head of the Hamas delegation, Salah al-Arouri, is the newly-appointed deputy chief of the group’s political bureau. Currently living in exile, he was accused by Israel in 2014 of plotting a coup against Mr. Abbas.

Even if the talks accomplish little, an Israeli analyst said, they are still worth pursuing. “There is no tax on talking,” said Shalom Harari, a retired Israeli general and former senior adviser on Palestinian affairs to Israel’s Defense Ministry. Yet, he added, “the maximum that can be achieved is an interim arrangement with some changes at the crossings — a mini reconciliation.”
Talal Okal, a veteran political analyst in Gaza, said Hamas was trying to take on a more national role and to strengthen its relations with Egypt. “I think Hamas is ready for understandings about resistance here,” Mr. Okal said. “Nobody can remove their weapons and armaments, but they will find a way to put this aside for a while.”
Hamas says the current talks should be based on a reconciliation agreement reached in Cairo in 2011, which called for a unity government and legislative and presidential elections within a year.
But the crux of the problem, said Michael Herzog, an Israel-based fellow with The Washington Institute for Near East Policy who has participated in most of the Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations, is that Hamas and Fatah appeared to be going into the negotiations with different goals and visions.
“For Abbas, this is about Hamas giving up control of Gaza to the Palestinian Authority,” Mr. Herzog said. “The way Hamas sees it, it’s a two-way street. They give up some control of Gaza, but in return the West Bank opens up to them, they are allowed to operate there and this opens the way for Hamas to take over the Palestinian national movement.”
For Israel, the United States and other international players, the prospects of any peace process will depend on the outcome. “If the Authority takes full control of Gaza and can deliver Gaza, that will be a good thing,” Mr. Herzog said. “If Hamas ultimately becomes a dominant party in policy decisions on the Palestinian side, that’s a bad thing.”",fake
2010,Trump administration to roll back Obama clean power rule,"Image copyright AFP Image caption Scott Pruitt addressed a crowd in Kentucky - where some hope for a coal revival
The Trump administration has confirmed plans to repeal an Obama administration rule to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Scott Pruitt, who has voiced doubt of climate change, called the Clean Power Plan an overreach.
President Donald Trump ordered the EPA to rewrite the rule in March.
The Clean Power Plan requires states to meet carbon emission reduction targets based on their energy consumption.
Mr Pruitt said he would sign the proposed rule to begin withdrawing from the plan on Tuesday.
""The war on coal is over,"" he told a crowd in Hazard, Kentucky, on Monday.
He continued: ""That rule really was about picking winners and losers.
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Matt McGrath explains why we should care about climate change
""Regulatory power should not be used by any regulatory body to pick winners and losers.""
Mr Pruitt has previously argued that the Clean Power Plan would force states to favour renewable energy in the electricity-generation market.
As Oklahoma's attorney general, he took part in a lawsuit by 27 US states against the rule.
A Supreme Court ruling in February 2016 left the regulation in limbo.
The EPA under President Barack Obama said the Clean Power Plan could prevent up to 150,000 asthma attacks in children and 6,600 premature deaths.
But according to US media, a leaked draft of the repeal proposal disputes the health benefits touted by the previous administration.
The draft also reportedly argues the country would save $33bn (£25bn) by dropping the regulation.
The Clean Power Plan required states to devise a way to cut planet-warming emissions by 32% below 2005 levels by 2030.
Eliminating the rule would make it difficult for the US to fulfil its promise to cut emissions as part of the Paris Climate accord, a 2015 international agreement which President Obama signed with nearly 200 other countries to limit greenhouse gas emissions and combat global warming.
Mr Trump in June signalled that he would pull out of the pact, dismantling his predecessor's environmental legacy.
In August the Trump administration issued its first written notification to the UN that it intended to withdraw from the agreement.
But the move was largely viewed as symbolic as no nation seeking to leave the pact can officially announce an intention to withdraw until 4 November 2019.
The process of leaving then takes another year, meaning it would not be complete until just weeks after the US presidential election in 2020.
The planned repeal of the Clean Power Plan has sparked outrage among environmental groups.
The National Resources Defense Council (NRDC) threatened to sue the EPA if the plan is repealed while the Sierra Club has indicated it would fight any new rule that does not comply with the country's air pollution laws.
Mary Anne Hitt, the director of the Sierra Club's Beyond Coal Campaign, said in a statement the Trump administration was ""putting the safety of our communities at risk, and making it crystal clear they have no intention of safeguarding people from the very real, immediate dangers of climate change"".",fake

SpaceX, a private aerospace manufacturer and transport service, launched another payload into low Earth orbit Monday morning using a Falcon 9 rocket. Ten Iridium Next satellites, numbers 21 thru 30, represent the third such launch for the SpaceX/Iridium partnership as the satellite communication company looks to build its next-generation constellation for voice and data. The Falcon 9 spacecraft lifted off on the Iridium-3 mission from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California at 8:37 EDT during a one-second-wide “instantaneous” launch window. The first stage booster returned safely to Earth where it landed on the autonomous landing ship “Just Read the Instructions.” At about 51 minutes after launch, the second stage re-ignited for a short burn to circularize the craft’s orbit so that it could begin a 15-minute process of deploying satellites directly over ground stations. Beginning at about 57:10 after launch, the satellite dispenser began deploying the satellites about 100 seconds apart after which they increased their own altitude to their final orbit. All ten satellites separated cleanly and in position. SpaceX has another launch planned for Wednesday evening. Full Webcast of the SpaceX Iridium-3 Falcon 9 mission

538,PreseasonBlackhawks at Boston4-2 Loss Recap,"PreseasonBlackhawks at Boston4-2 Loss Recap
(Before It's News)
The Blackhawks sent their kid squad to Boston to face the Bruins, Monday night. Most of the regulars were left back in South Bend and it showed. The only regular players that were in this game were Brandon Saad, Connor Murphy, and Corey Crawford. That should tell you some things right off the bat. Not only that, but the roster listed Luke Johnson as #82, and playing defense. Jordan Oesterle gets no respect. It’s preseason for everyone, I suppose.
If not for the final minute, the first period was a complete disaster. The Hawks gave up two goals on the first handful of shots and then later gave up a third goal before they were able to stop the bleeding.
The second period couldn’t have possibly been any worse, so there was only one way to go: UP. The Hawks were able to hold the Bruins off the board while scoring a goal to bring the game back within one goal.
In the third period, the Blackhawks gave up a powerplay goal that put the game out of reach and, much like Saturday night, they didn’t have enough time to complete the comeback. Not a terrible showing for the Blackhawks, but certainly not an overly impressive one, either. Let’s hope we get to see more regulars in the final two preseason games.
The Good
Brandon Saad was able to cut the lead to just 2 goals, with under a minute remaining in the first period. Cody Franson, hit Erik Gustafsson across the ice. Gustafsson then turned and saw Brandon Saad just about 5 feet to Malcolm Subban’s right, wisely hitting Saad’s tape with a pass which was redirected by Saad off Subban and into the net.
Midway through the second period, a gassed Jordan Oesterle desperately flicked the puck up to Tanner Kero. Even though the pass was behind him, Kero was able to corral the puck and make a slick pass to the streaking John Hayden. Hayden drove hard to the net,
protecting the puck, and beat Subban. The puck hit the back post and was originally waved off, but the war room in Toronto signalled the horn and ruled the play a good goal.
protecting the puck, and beat Subban. The puck hit the back post and was originally waved off, but the war room in Toronto signalled the horn and ruled the play a good goal. For the second game in a row, the Blackhawks were pretty good at the faceoff dots, winning 58%.
The Bad
Corey Crawford only saw 23 shots and gave up 4 goals. Thank god it is preseason.
The Golden Child Debrincat had his time to shine, and was virtually invisible. Three shots on net and no points. If I didn’t know he was on the roster for the game, I might have even doubted that he played.
The Ugly
Under a minute into the game, on the first shot on net, David Pastrnak caught Corey Crawford deep in his net, and Pastrnak ate him up from a sharp angle.
thirty six seconds after the Pastrnak goal, defenseman Jeremy Lasuzon flipped an innocent dump in shot towards Corey Crawford, and Crawford just flubbed it. If you thought the first goal was bad, this one was even worse.
About 8 minutes later, the veteran Bruins caught Gustav Forsling hanging onto the puck too long and trying to stickhandle with one hand on his stick right up the gut, in his own zone. Marchand and Bergeron stripped him, and the late forward Anders Bjork was the lucky recipient of a backdoor tap in goal.

1891,"U.S. President Donald Trump Quietly Signs Law To Allow Warrantless Searches In Parts Of VA, DC and MD","By Aaron Kesel
As former White House chief of staff and current Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel has said: “You never let a serious crisis go to waste.” While everyone was worried about the hurricanes, U.S. President Donald Trump signed away the Fourth Amendment buried in a new bill. He set a precedent by empowering the police state to allow warrantless searches in parts of VA, MD and D.C. near the Metro train system.
The government can now openly enter and search private property without a warrant in parts of Virginia, Maryland and D.C.
The House Joint Resolution 76 was signed into law on Tuesday, Aug. 22, by President Trump. The text is rather boring, starting off with: “Granting the consent and approval of Congress for the Commonwealth of Virginia, the State of Maryland, and the District of Columbia to enter into a compact relating to the establishment of the Washington Metrorail Safety Commission.”
CNN explained, “This law lets Virginia, Maryland and the District of Columbia form a new panel called the Washington Metrorail Safety Commission to oversee the safety of the D.C.-area public transportation Metro train system.”
The new safety commission will take over from the current Federal Transit Agency (FTA), which has been in charge of safety oversight for the Washington Metropolitan Area Interstate Compact (WMATA) since October 2015.
“We’ll set this up and get the FTA out of Metro. They are happy to get out, and we’re happy to get them out,” Metro Board of Directors Chair Jack Evans told Bloomberg BNA. “I’m glad we got this thing. If nothing else, we’ll get our money.”
However, buried within the bill’s text is a daunting “one major red flag” that would give the newly formed commission “the authority to enter property near the Metro Rail System ‘without limitation’ and without a warrant, for the purpose of ‘making inspections, investigations, examinations, and testing,” The Free Thought Project reported.
The legislation reads:
In performing its duties, the Commission, through its Board or designated employees or agents, may: Enter upon the WMATA Rail System and, upon reasonable notice and a finding by the chief executive officer that a need exists, upon any lands, waters, and premises adjacent to the WMATA Rail System, including, without limitation, property owned or occupied by the federal government, for the purpose of making inspections, investigations, examinations, and testing as the Commission may deem necessary to carry out the purposes of this MSC Compact, and such entry shall not be deemed a trespass.
Only five Congressman voted against the bill according to U.S. Rep Justin Amash (R-Mich.) while three hundred ninety-nine gave their approval, and 29 didn’t bother to vote at all. Apparently, our elected officials can’t be bothered to stand up for the rights of we the people or the Constitution they swore to protect. After all, the Fourth Amendment doesn’t exist, which protects Americans from unreasonable searches and seizures or anything. As Amash pointed out, the government will now be able to kick in the doors of any private property surrounding the border of the DC Metro Rail System without needing a warrant based on any probable cause.
Only 5 of us voted against bill allowing govt to enter/search private property in parts of VA, MD & DC w/o warrant. https://t.co/SVhTWqbPaB — Justin Amash (@justinamash) July 18, 2017 The Firearms Survival Guide (Ad)
A scary prospect indeed, as Rachel Blevins wrote for The Free Thought Project, “While it may only affect the Washington, D.C., metro area now, it could be laying the blueprint for future legislation across the country.”

The U.S. controversy over football players who kneel during the national anthem is raging on.
But an older patriotic ritual ran aground on geopolitical tensions.
That’s the Pledge of Allegiance, which was first recited in public schools on this day in 1892.
The pledge was written by Francis Bellamy, a Baptist minister and socialist, to be rolled out with a nationwide push to celebrate Columbus Day in schools. It was soon widely recognized.
Mr. Bellamy instructed that a salute be performed with the pledge: right arm extended upward, with the palm twisting up at the first mention of the flag.
When fascist regimes emerged in Italy and Germany using the extended-arm salute, Bellamy’s began to fall from favor. As one author wrote, the “similarities in the salute had begun to attract comment as early as the mid-1930s.”

On Dec. 22, 1942, Congress amended the U.S. Flag Code to instruct that the pledge “be rendered by standing at attention facing the flag with the right hand over the heart” — the stance still in use today.

2389,Dave Doeren has finally gotten that signature win,"Dave Doeren has finally gotten that signature win
(Before It's News)
The tenure of Dave Doeren has been an interesting one at NC State. He was brought in to win games, and in his first 4 seasons it was looking rocky. He was not beating teams that he should have (last year ECU, BC are just 2 of those examples). The fan base was becoming very restless in Raleigh. The complaints were many, and wide ranging. There was the dismissal of Offensive Coordinator Matt Canada, there was “he lacked personality,” and then there was the no signature wins. No wins against teams that he had less “talent” than. That all ended on Saturday, with the Wolfpack’s victory against Florida State. Now, people will say, that the reason that NC State won is because FSU lost Deonndre Francois. Others will say it was because of the ref’s and some questionable calls (yes, there were some). Still others will say it was because of the 2 week layoff that the Seminoles had because of Hurricane Irma (this is the only one I’ll give you). Through all of this, Dave Doeren’s team came out and did what it needed to do. The Wolfpack defensive line was dominant, making life hell for FSU’s true freshman quaterback. The offense was balanced rushing the ball 37 times and passing 33 times.
Dave Doeren has been working on all of the things that critics have been throwing at him. If you watched him on The Coaches Room during the National Championship game last season, you saw the personality come out! He was funny and engaging! Dave Doeren needed this game against FSU! He won against a team that will be a top 25 team at the end of the season! Now all he has to do, is not allow this team to rest on this win and continue carrying on that intensity that they took to Doak Campbell Stadium this past Saturday.

2120,Eminem's takedown of Donald Trump: The most explosive lines,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Eminem's video message: 'We're not afraid of Trump'
Rapper Eminem took aim at President Donald Trump at Tuesday night's BET Awards in a vicious, four-and-a-half-minute freestyle.
The star said he ""came to stomp"" on the president, calling him a ""racist 94-year-old grandpa"" and accusing him of disrespecting the military.
In the video, the star paces back and forth in a disused Detroit car park, sparring with the camera as he raps.
The a capella track immediately won praise from the hip-hop community.
Snoop Dogg posted a video praising the rapper for taking a stand; Sean Combs, aka Puff Daddy, tweeted that Eminem had ""killed it""; while J Cole called the star a ""rap God"".
T-Pain appeared to voice concern that Eminem, whose real name is Marshall Mathers, had made himself a target by voicing his anger.
It's not the first time Eminem has targeted Mr Trump: A verse in last year's Campaign Speech warned voters the then-presidential candidate was a ""loose cannon"".
However his latest track, called The Storm, is notable not just for its creative profanity, but also the detail of his criticisms.
The track is even named after the ominous comments Mr Trump made last week while posing for a photograph with military leaders, suggesting their meeting was ""the calm before the storm"".
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Donald Trump makes cryptic comments about ""calm before the storm""
Here are five of the most explosive lines in Eminem's rap.
1) ""A kamikaze that will probably cause a nuclear holocaust""
Here, Eminem is referencing the escalating tension between the US and North Korea, over the latter's nuclear activities.
President Trump has repeatedly belittled his Korean counterpart, Kim Jong Un, referring to him as ""rocket man"". Over the weekend, he appeared to reject a diplomatic solution to the situation, tweeting that ""only one thing will work!""
Eminem's full verse is: ""We better give Obama props/'Cause what we got in office now is a kamikaze/That will probably cause a nuclear holocaust/While the drama pops/And he waits for [expletive] to quiet down/He'll just gas his plane up and fly around/Till the bombing stops.""
2) ""He keeps screaming, 'drain the swamp', 'cause he's in quicksand.""
This section appears to criticise the Republican Party's failure to denounce Donald Trump, especially after his controversial argument that ""both sides"" were at fault for white supremacist violence in Charlottesville this August.
""Racism's the only thing he's Fantastic 4,"" raps Eminem, referencing the Marvel comic book series in order to compare Trump to The Thing, because ""he's orange"".

3) ""He attacks the NFL so we focus on that - instead of talking Puerto Rico or gun reform for Nevada""
Image copyright PA Image caption Members of the Jacksonville Jaguars kneel in protest during the national anthem at Wembley Stadium, London
Eminem lingers for a long time on the president's continued attacks on American Football players, who have been protesting about police brutality by kneeling during the national anthem.
""He gets an enormous reaction/When he attacks the NFL so we focus on that/Instead of talking Puerto Rico or gun reform for Nevada/All these horrible tragedies and he's bored and would rather/Cause a Twitter storm with the Packers,"" raps the star.
He returns to the theme later, attacking the president's attempts to suppress the protests, and suggesting the racist motivation that black people should ""know their place"".
""Now, if you're a black athlete/You're a spoiled little brat for trying to use your platform or your stature/To try to give those a voice who don't have one.""
Eminem rounds this section off by dedicating The Storm to Colin Kaepernick, the NFL player who initiated the protests. Kaepernick later tweeted his thanks to the rapper.
4) ""He don't like his war heroes captured""
Image copyright BBC / AFP Image caption Strangely, Donald Trump once endorsed Eminem as a political candidate
Here, Eminem accuses Mr Trump of double standards.
The president has accused NFL players of disrespecting the military by refusing to kneel in front of the flag, but Eminem references Mr Trump's attacks on Arizona Senator John McCain, who spent five years as a prisoner during the Vietnam War.
In 2015, Trump questioned whether Mr McCain was a war hero, saying: ""I like people that weren't captured, OK?""
Eminem's full lyric is: ""He says you're spitting in the face of vets who fought for us/Unless you're a POW who's tortured/'Cause to him you're zero 'cause he don't like his war heroes captured.""
""That's not disrespecting the military,"" the star adds.
5) ""America stand up""
The song ends with an ultimatum. Eminem draws ""in the sand, a line"", telling Trump supporters they are no longer welcome to be his fans.
""Any fan of mine who's a supporter of his,"" he spits, ""You're either for or against.
""And if you can't decide who you like more and you're split/On who you should stand beside/I'll do it for you with this,"" he continues, before delivering one of the song's more unprintable lyrics.
The song concludes with the lyrics; ""The rest of America stand up/We love our military, and we love our country/But we hate Trump.""
Skip Twitter post by @andylassner Not totally sure how rap battles work, but I believe Eminem is now the President of the United States of America. — andy lassner (@andylassner) October 11, 2017 Report
The President has yet to respond.
However, many fans took glee in recalling the time Mr Trump endorsed Eminem as a presidential candidate in a mock political rally for MTV.

99,U.S. House approves disaster funds as Trump criticizes Puerto Rico,"Buildings damaged by Hurricane Maria are seen in Lares, Puerto Rico, October 6, 2017. REUTERS/Lucas Jackson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday approved $36.5 billion in emergency relief for hurricane-hit Puerto Rico and other areas that have suffered recent disasters.
In addition to the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, which is recovering from devastation wreaked by Hurricane Maria, the bill will also provide funds for the storm-struck areas of Florida, Texas, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and fire-ravaged California.
The bipartisan bill sailed through the Republican-controlled House - approved by a 353-to-69 vote - just hours after President Donald Trump said that government response teams could not stay in Puerto Rico “forever.”
Trump’s comments on Twitter on Thursday morning were followed by White House reassurances that the administration was “committed” to disaster relief in Puerto Rico.
Trump criticized Puerto Rico for “a total lack of accountability,” saying “electric and all infrastructure was disaster before hurricanes.”
While he noted it was up to “Congress to decide how much to spend,” he also said: “We cannot keep FEMA, the Military & the First Responders, who have been amazing (under the most difficult circumstances) in P.R. forever!”
FEMA is the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which oversees disaster response in the United States.
Puerto Rico is burdened with nearly $72 billion in pre-hurricane debt, overseen by a federally-created board. Much of the island remains without electricity or running water three weeks after Hurricane Maria made landfall.
Asked for a response to Trump’s remarks, the White House later said it was “committed to helping Puerto Rico” and working with local leaders and Congress “to identify the best fiscally responsible path forward.”
“Successful recoveries do not last forever; they should be as swift as possible to help people resume their normal lives,” White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said in a statement.
White House Chief of Staff John Kelly reiterated during a Thursday news briefing that the Trump administration would “stand with those American citizens in Puerto Rico until the job is done.”
Trump’s comments had prompted swift condemnation from some Democratic lawmakers, who said threatening to withdraw help from Puerto Rico would amount to abandoning U.S. citizens as the island struggles with the storm’s aftermath.

Democratic Representative Nydia Velazquez of New York, which has a large Puerto Rican community, said on the House floor that the island is facing a “humanitarian crisis”.
“The president of the United States is tweeting out threats to withdraw assistance, that is an outrage, that is an insult,” Velazquez said.
Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, which also has a sizeable Puerto Rican community, told Reuters that he had urged Trump to create a high-level task force to provide advice for rebuilding the island, and that the president was receptive to the idea.
House Speaker Paul Ryan said he would be traveling to Puerto Rico on Friday as part of a bipartisan congressional delegation to assess the damage.

The House bill includes $18.7 billion for FEMA’s disaster relief fund. Of that, $4.9 billion is earmarked for loans to local governments to ensure that cash-strapped Puerto Rico can keep government programs operating beyond Oct. 31, when funds are otherwise due to run out.
“FEMA will be w/Puerto Rico, USVI, every state, territory impacted by a disaster every day, supporting throughout their response & recovery,” FEMA spokeswoman Eileen Lainez wrote on Twitter.
Other funds include $576.5 million for the federal government’s wildfire control efforts.
Some $16 billion would go towards the National Flood Insurance Program to help it cover claims after reaching its borrowing limit.
The Senate, also controlled by Republicans, is expected to vote on the package later this month.
Republican and Democratic lawmakers agreed that additional help would likely be needed.
“We’re going to need more assistance as the days, the months go,” said Republican Representative Mario Diaz-Balart of Florida, a state also dealing with hurricane aftermath.
Velazquez called Thursday’s bill a “down payment in helping the response” in Puerto Rico and other areas affected by hurricanes and wildfires.
“Let’s be clear there is going to need to be much more assistance in the future,” Velazquez said.",fake
2439,United Airlines Kills Worlds Largest Bunny During Flight,"United Airlines faces another controversy after a ‘fit and healthy’ giant rabbit expected to become the world’s biggest died suddenly on one of its planes.
 
Simon, a ten-month-old 3ft continental giant rabbit expected to weigh more than 2st 5lbs when fully grown, was bought by a mystery US celebrity buyer who paid more than $2,568 to fly him from Heathrow to Chicago.
 
Had he lived Simon was expected to outgrow the world’s biggest rabbit – his 4ft 4in father Darius.
 
But his devastated owner Annette Edwards from Stoulton in Worcester claims he died in the cargo hold of United Airlines flight from Heathrow Airport to Chicago on April 19.
 
United told Annette, a breeder of large rabbits and former Playboy model, survived the flight but died when being held in a storage room in O’Hare International Airport.
 
The row over Simon’s mysterious death came weeks after passenger Dr David Dao was filmed being beaten and dragged off a United Express flight sparked widespread outrage.

3190,Securing Your Home’s Door: Secrets Your Locksmith Won’t Tell You,"Securing Your Home’s Door: Secrets Your Locksmith Won’t Tell You
% of readers think this story is Fact. Add your two cents.
(Before It's News)
http://robertsiciliano.com/
Are you making a big home security mistake? If you are leaving your doors unlocked, or if you are using low quality lock systems, you are putting yourself…and your home…at risk.
However, just because your door is locked, it doesn’t mean that a burglar can’t kick the door down. But, having the door locked can make it more difficult. This is only one secret that your local locksmith won’t tell you, but there are several more. Here are a few:
Securing Your Doors
Reinforce the door frame around the hinge and lock. Consider door reinforcement kits, such as Door Devil.
Install a peephole.
Don’t answer the door unless you are expecting a visitor. Tell the same to your kids.
Install hardened steel deadbolts. These are highly encouraged. Make sure they have a five-pin tumbler, too.
Consider multi-lock deadbolts or vertical deadbolts.
Accessories for Your Door to Make it More Secure
Consider a door brace. These will help to prevent a burglar from opening the door.
A wedge or door stop will likely not totally stop a burglar, but if you choose one with an alarm, anyone in the home will definitely hear it.
A door chain will not protect you. It doesn’t take a lot of pressure to break them.
Additional Tips for Door Security
Replace your hollow wood door with a metal or solid wood door.
Choose a door that does NOT have a window. An intruder can easily break a window and access the lock.
If you have a current door that DOES have a window, install attractive metal bars over the glass.
Make sure the hinges of the door are not visible on the outside of the door.
Consider installing a cross bar. This is a heavy steel bar that you can place across the inside of the door.
Inspect deadbolts. Any deadbolt that is low quality should be replaced. If you want to have even more security, install a second deadbolt.
Use door braces when you can. Take one of these braces and stick it under the knob of the door. The other end will remain on the floor at an angle to the doorknob. These are great devices, but too many people forget to put the brace up before they go to bed or leave the home. It is useless if it is just leaning against the wall, and it only takes a couple of seconds to put into place.
For the best door security, think about installing some type of door reinforcement kit. Imagine how secure your door would be with 1/16-inch of heavy steel. No one could kick through that! Also, imagine a four-foot metal bar that you install right over the strike plates and screw directly into the frame of the door. This will give you one tough security system on your door, and it’s exactly what the door jamb security kit from Door Devil offers. See here on YouTube.

(Before It's News)

I hate the single wild card game because it makes me uneasy all day. Now tonight the plan is to get home, get to my basement, put a few Corona’s in the frig, sit with my now 15 year old and watch the Yankees play the Twins. But I yell a lot in this intense game setting because there’s just so much pressure on the players and of course us fans too, who just want a nice win for a team that has given their all this entire season. The “series”, bet of 3, best of 5, best of 7 is so much better than a single game, because you can pivot strategy if need be after you get a look at your match-up each time. But not in a single game. It’s about the stress of not screwing up and all of that. For me, the fan, I freak out. It’s not that I don’t trust the Yankees… I kind of worry about Joe Girardi.
Photo: Getty Images
Joe’s done a pretty good job this season, I tip my cap. But there are those moments where you throw your hands up in disgust, and I just hope tonight he doesn’t overthink it and overtinker and rather, just let the team play. One of my favorites, Kevin Kernan writes this gem about the Yanks and Girardi and about being “themselves”… here’s some of that:
“Joe Girardi can be high strung. Joe Girardi can be controlling. He can have a quick hook as Dellin Betances has learned, but the Joe Girardi the Yankees have seen this season is a much different manager than in the past.
Photo: Getty Images
Girardi has let the Yankees play. He has stayed out of the way and has let them have fun. He’s loosened up a bit and as a result these Yankees are a blast to watch. They lead the majors in smiles. Thumbs Down is their thing.
The clubhouse is looser and Girardi has allowed personalities to emerge…”
And all of that is true, but what happens if tonight he starts to micro-manage because it’s a playoff game and not a regular season game. Remember, THIS IS ONE GAME THAT DETERMINES THE NEXT ROUND. You blow it, there is no next round.
Photo: NJ.com
Brett Gardner, the unspoken Yankee captain said this about the Yanks. Love the looseness here folks….
“‘I feel good about our chances,’ Brett Gardner said. ‘I like the fact we get to throw Luis Severino out there tomorrow. He’s been pretty darn good this year.’”
Photo: Getty Images
Love that, and love Severino, but he’s young and once again, I go back to Joe Girardi who has an itchy trigger finger and likes to pull guys if they get into a jam. It concerns me. Will Joe look at Sevy and pull him too soon? Will he try and relax and like Kernan says, let them play? Tough to say right now.
Look, in the end, I will be stressed out. I think that’s been established here. And yes, I know ultimately we just have to sit back and watch, but again, the Yankees have had quite a season. No one expected the playoffs. In fact, we thought maybe next season was the year. And so, I just don’t want it messed up in one game. Again… it’s not the Yankees, I think they can go all the way with what they have. I am concerned about their manager though. Not that I don’t have respect for Joe, I certainly do.
My worry is he’ll tinker when he doesn’t have to. If he sits back and lets the Yankees play, I think we will have a nice outcome tonight. If he starts cracking open the binder every 3 minutes and making unnecessary pitching changes and late inning pinch hitting, it may sabotage the Yankees chances in this 1 game wild card playoff. And my Lord, I hope to God that doesn’t happen.
Good luck to my Yankees tonight. I wish you well. I’ll be the fan in my basement surrounded by Yankee memorabilia, washing down Tums with a bottle of Corona.
Go Yanks!

597,"If You’re Italian, German or Irish-American, This is How Your Ancestors Were Treated as Immigrants","America has a shady past of treating people who were considered the “others” with disrespect and violence. Do you think that what’s happening now to the Muslims is new? Do you think it only happened to African-American’s in History’s past? If so, you should read on and learn your history. Something worth sharing with your friends.
 
Italian-Americans – “The largest mass lynching in U.S. history took place in New Orleans in 1891 — and it wasn’t African-Americans who were lynched, as many of us might assume. It was Italian-Americans.”
 
 – America has a proud tradition as an immigrant nation, but it also has a long history of marginalizing those it marks as “other.” America’s other heritage includes suspicion, hostility, abuse and even death, leveled against ethnic groups as they arrived one after another in waves over the past 2½ centuries.
 
I learned much about this as I researched “The Family Corleone,” a novel I wrote based on a screenplay by Mario Puzo. The novel is about, among other things, Italian-Americans living in New York during the depression.
 
There were a number of things that surprised me in my initial research. I knew something about our nation’s early antipathy toward Catholics and Italians, but I had not fully appreciated the depth of that antagonism. For example, the largest mass lynching in U.S. history took place in New Orleans in 1891 — and it wasn’t African-Americans who were lynched, as many of us might assume. It was Italian-Americans.
 
After nine Italians were tried and found not guilty of murdering New Orleans Police Chief David Hennessy, a mob dragged them from the jail, along with two other Italians being held on unrelated charges, and lynched them all. The lynchings were followed by mass arrests of Italian immigrants throughout New Orleans, and waves of attacks against Italians nationwide.
 
What was the reaction of our country’s leaders to the lynchings? Teddy Roosevelt, not yet president, famously said they were “a rather good thing.” The response in The New York Times was worse. A March 16, 1891, editorial referred to the victims of the lynchings as “… sneaking and cowardly Sicilians, the descendants of bandits and assassins.” An editorial the next day argued that: “Lynch law was the only course open to the people of New Orleans. …”
 
John Parker, who helped organize the lynch mob, later went on to be governor of Louisiana. In 1911, he said of Italians that they were “just a little worse than the Negro, being if anything filthier in [their] habits, lawless, and treacherous.”
 
In addition to prejudice based on ethnicity, Italian immigrants also had to face an older hostility toward their religion. In earlier centuries, Catholics in America were in a position similar to today’s Muslims. In 1785, when Catholics proposed building St. Peter’s Church in the heart of Manhattan, city officials, fearing the papacy and sinister foreign influences, forced them to relocate outside the city limits. In this incident, it’s easy to hear echoes of the Murfreesboro protests, as well as the ongoing protests against an Islamic center proposed for 51 Park Place in contemporary Manhattan.
 
On December 24, 1806, two decades after St. Peter’s was built on Church Street, where it still stands, protesters surrounded the church, outraged by mysterious ceremonies going on inside, ceremonies we now commonly understand to be the celebration of Christmas. The Christmas Eve 1806 protest led to a riot in which dozens were injured and a policeman was killed.
 
The decades go by, they turn into centuries, and we forget. We’ve forgotten the depth of prejudice and outright hatred faced by Italian immigrants in America. We’ve forgotten the degree to which we once feared and distrusted Catholics. If we remembered, I wonder how much it might change the way we think about today’s immigrant populations, or our attitudes toward Muslims?
 
The question of prejudice toward Italians and Catholics was ancillary to my writing project, something I wanted to better understand in order to fully imagine my characters. Nonetheless, the research left me with even greater respect for generations of Italian Catholic immigrants who struggled to make their way in a world so initially hostile to them and to their religion; and by extrapolation, for all immigrants and members of minority faiths everywhere, in every historical period, including our own, who face similar struggles.
 
The Anti-German Crusade – “A Minnesota minister was tarred and feathered when he was overheard praying in German with a dying woman.”
 
During World War I, many German Americans were broadly accused of being sympathetic to the German Empire without regard to their individual loyalties. Former president Theodore Roosevelt was one of the most significant voices in this national suspicion, denouncing “hyphenated Americanism” and insisting that dual loyalties were impossible to maintain in times of conflict. This wartime xenophobia spread throughout the United States in the form of community scorn and organized state and government repression.
 
Anti-German fervor during World War I resulted in the renaming of food that was of German origin or that simply sounded German. Sauerkraut became “liberty cabbage,” frankfurters were called “hot dogs,” and Salisbury steak was given a less gastronomically pleasing but more Americanized label: “meat loaf.” Streets and even some municipalities with German monikers changed, such as the renaming of the Michigan town of Berlin to “Marne” in honor of those who fought in the Allied victory at the First Battle of Marne.
 
In early September, Congress passed a bill requiring all German-language newspapers published in the United States to print English translations of any commentary about U.S. government policies and international relations or the state or conduct of the war. The same rule was applied regarding any other nation with which Germany was at war.
 
While thousands of German immigrants were forced to buy war bonds to prove their loyalty to the United States, they were rewarded with widespread xenophobia from national organizations as well as from their neighbors. The Red Cross barred individuals with German last names from joining, for fear of sabotage. The Cincinnati Public Library was asked to withdraw all German books from its shelves. In much darker examples of bigotry fueled by the war, German-born Robert Prager was dragged from a Collinsville, Illinois, jail and lynched by a mob who suspected him of spying, while a Minnesota minister was tarred and feathered when he was overheard praying in German with a dying woman.
 
Language was a major fear factor driving the anti-German hatred and manifested itself in legislation that attempted to isolate foreign-language practitioners. In the 1918 Babel Proclamation, the governor of Iowa prohibited all foreign languages in schools and public places. Nebraska barred instruction in any language except English, although the U.S. Supreme Court ruled the ban illegal in the 1923 case of Meyer v. Nebraska. The response by German Americans was often to “Americanize” their names (e.g., changing “Schmidt” to “Smith,” or “Müller” to “Miller”) and to limit their use of the German language in public places, especially churches.
 
In anticipation of support for Germany among immigrants, President Wilson issued two sets of regulations, on April 6 and November 16, 1917, imposing restrictions on German-born male residents over the age of 14, including natives of Germany who had taken citizenship in countries other than the United States. Approximately 250,000 men were required to register at their local post offices and carry registration cards at all times, as well as report any changes of address or employment; the regulations were extended to women in April 1918.
 
The U.S. government investigated thousands of people under these regulations and eventually arrested approximately 6,300 “aliens.” Allegations included spying for Germany or endorsing the German war effort. Internees were held at two camps splitting the eastern and western United States along the Mississippi River: Fort Oglethorpe in Georgia and Fort Douglas in Utah. While most internees were released in June 1919, some remained in custody through March and April 1920.
 
While Germany was at war with France and Britain beginning in August 1914, America had not yet joined the conflict. Yet there were several German military vessels in U.S. ports that were ordered to leave or be detained. The crews of these ships were first held as alien internees and later as prisoners of war.
 
When war broke out in Europe, hundreds of men on two German cruisers, the Prinz Eitel Friedrich and the Kronprinz Wilhelm, were unwilling to face the might of the British Navy in the Atlantic and instead lived for several years on their ships in various Virginia ports and frequently enjoyed shore leave. Eventually they were given a strip of land in the Norfolk Navy Yard in Norfolk, Virginia, on which to erect accommodations.
 
In October 1916, the ships and their personnel were moved to the Philadelphia Navy Yard along with the structures, which became known locally as the “German Village.” Yet the village was still located at a secure U.S. military facility surrounded by barbed wire. In the spring of 1917, nine detainees escaped, prompting U.S. Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels to transfer the other 750 residents of the village to secure units at Fort McPherson in Georgia and Fort Oglethorpe, separated from the civilian internees there.
 
In December 1914, the German gunboat Cormoran attempted to refuel and restock its provision at the American island territory of Guam. Denied the full amount of fuel needed, the German captain optioned to remain in Guam along with the crewmen as alien detainees. Most of the crew lived on board due to a lack of housing and relations remained friendly, even though the German seamen outnumbered the island’s contingent of U.S. Marines.
 
As a result of German U-boat attacks on American shipping, the United States broke off diplomatic relations with Germany in February 1917. U.S. authorities in Guam imposed greater restrictions on the German detainees as relations between America and Germany worsened. Following the U.S. declaration of war against Germany in April 1917, Americans demanded, “the immediate and unconditional surrender of the ship and personnel.” The captain and crew destroyed the Cormoran with an explosion that took several German lives. The surviving 353 German sailors were shipped to the U.S. mainland as POWs on April 29, 1917.
 
Irish-Americans, Racism and the Pursuit of Whiteness – “Irish were to negative stereotyping that was very similar to that of enslaved Africans and African Americans. The comic Irishman – happy, lazy, stupid, “White Negroes.”
 
Like many immigrant groups in the United States, the Irish were characterized as racial Others when they first arrived in the first half of the 19th century. The Irish had suffered profound injustice in the U.K. at the hands of the British, widely seen as “white negroes.” The potato famine that created starvation conditions that cost the lives of millions of Irish and forced the out-migration of millions of surviving ones, was less a natural disaster and more a complex set of social conditions created by British landowners (much like Hurricane Katrina). Forced to flee from their native Ireland and the oppressive British landowners, many Irish came to the U.S.
 
Once in the U.S., the Irish were to negative stereotyping that was very similar to that of enslaved Africans and African Americans. The comic Irishman – happy, lazy, stupid, with a gift for music and dance – was a stock character in American theater. Drunkenness and criminality were major themes of Irish stereotypes, and the term “paddy wagon” has its etymological roots in the racist term “paddy,” a shortening of the name “Patrick,” which was used to refer to the Irish. However, this is also a gendered image and refers to Irish men, specifically. The masculine imagery of “paddy” hides the existence of Irish women, but did not protect Irish women from racism as they were often more exposed to such racism through domestic jobs. Women typically played a key role in maintaining Catholic adherence, which resonates closely with Irishness and difference. The “model minority” (if you will) stereotype of Irish-American women is of a “Bridget,” recognized for her hard work and contribution to Irish upward class mobility.
 
Simian, or ape-like caricature of the Irish immigrant was also a common one among the mainstream news publications of the day (much like the recent New York Post cartoon). For example, in 1867 American cartoonist Thomas Nast drew “The Day We Celebrate” a cartoon depicting the Irish on St. Patrick’s Day as violent, drunken apes. And, in 1899, Harper’s Weekly featrued a drawing of three men’s heads in profile: Irish, Anglo-Teutonic and Negro, in order to illustrate the similarity between the Irish and the Negro (and, the supposed superiority of the Anglo-Teutonic). In northern states, blacks and Irish immigrants were forced into overlapping – often integrated – slum neighborhoods. Although leaders of the Irish liberation struggle (in Ireland) saw slavery as an evil, their Irish-American cousins largely aligned with the slaveholders.
 
And, following the end of slavery, the Irish and African Americans were forced to compete for the same low-wage, low-status jobs. So, the “white negroes” of the U.K. came to the United States and, though not enslaved, faced a status almost as low as that of recently-freed blacks. While there were moments of solidarity between Irish and African Americans, this was short lived.
 
Over the course of the 19th and early 20th century, Irish Americans managed to a great extent to enter and become part of the dominant white culture. In an attempt to secure the prosperity and social position that their white skin had not guaranteed them in Europe, Irish immigrants lobbied for white racial status in America. Although Irish people’s pale skin color and European roots suggested evidence of their white racial pedigree, the discrimination that immigrants experienced on the job (although the extent of the “No Irish Need Apply” discrimination is disputed), the simian caricatures they saw of themselves in the newspapers, meant that “whiteness” was a status that would be achieved, not ascribed.
 
For some time now, Irish-Americans have been thoroughly regarded as “white.” Evidence of this assimilation into whiteness is presented by Mary C. Waters (Harvard) in a recent AJPH article, in which she writes that “the once-rigid lines that divided European-origin groups from one another have increasingly blurred.” Waters goes on to predict that the changes that European immigrants ahve experienced are “becoming more likely for groups we now define as ‘racial.’” While I certainly agree that the boundaries of whiteness are malleable – it is a racial category that expands and contracts based on historical, cultural and social conditions – I don’t know if it is malleable enough to include all the groups we now define as ‘racial’ Others.
 
As people rush to embrace even fictive Irish heritage and encourage strangers to “Kiss Me I’m Irish” today, take just a moment to reflect on the history of racism and the pursuit of whiteness wrapped up in this holiday.

3240,See Why The GOP Is Trying To Ban Steak And Seafood With Food Stamps – Do You Agree?,"See Why The GOP Is Trying To Ban Steak And Seafood With Food Stamps – Do You Agree?
 
Conservative lawmaker, Rick Brattin, introduced a bill in Missouri that will limit what items welfare recipients can purchase with food stamps.
 
He’s upset they have access to seafood and steak that he claims he can’t afford.
 
In 2013, Fox news proudly broadcast an interview with a young food stamp recipients who claimed to be using the government benefits to purchase lobster and sushi.
 
 “This is the way I want to live and I don’t really see anything changing,” Jason Greenslate explained to Fox. “It’s free food; it’s awesome!”
 
That story fit a longtime conservative suspicion that poor people use food stamps to purchase luxury items.
 
Now, a Republican state lawmaker in Missouri is pushing for legislation that would stop people like Greenslate and severely limit what food stamp recipients can buy.
 
The bill being proposed would ban the purchase of cookies, chips, energy drinks, soft drinks, seafood and steak with food stamps.
 
What do you think about this bill? Do you agree? Or do you think they have the right to purchase anything they want?

3290,Spanish regulator clears the way for Atlantia's bid for Abertis,"FILE PHOTO: The Abertis's logo is seen during a news conference in Barcelona, Spain, April 12, 2016. REUTERS/Albert Gea/File Photo
MADRID/MILAN (Reuters) - Spain’s market watchdog approved Italian infrastructure group Atlantia’s (ATL.MI) proposed takeover of Spanish rival Abertis (ABE.MC) on Monday, clearing one of the hurdles to the creation of the world’s biggest toll-roads operator.
Approval comes nearly five months after Atlantia announced it was offering 16.3 billion euros ($19 billion) in cash and shares to buy Abertis.
Spanish regulator CNMV said in a market filing the offer was conditional on shareholders representing at least 10.1 percent of Abertis share capital accepting payment in Atlantia shares.
In addition the offer must be accepted by shareholders representing at least 50 percent plus one share of the Spanish company.
Atlantia is offering to pay 16.5 euros for each Abertis share, a level that CNMV said was equitable.
Abertis shareholders will have 15 calendar days to accept the bid starting from the first trading day following the formal publication of the offer’s prospectus, the watchdog said.
One source with knowledge of the matter said this was expected to happen in the next few days.
Though the offer was described as “friendly” by Atlantia, Abertis’s shareholders have not expressed a view on the bid and potential counter-bids could still emerge.
The board of the Spanish company must publish its assessment of the bid within 10 days after the start of the acceptance period, Atlantia said.
The top shareholder in Abertis is Criteria Caixa, the financial arm of a politically connected and powerful banking foundation that controls Catalonia’s largest lender Caixabank (CABK.MC).
Several potential rivals for acquiring Abertis have been named in media reports in recent months, but only Spanish builder ACS (ACS.MC), which is headed by Real Madrid soccer club Chairman Florentino Perez, has said it is looking at making a possible counter-offer.
ACS is expected to decide this month whether to make an offer.
In the prospectus published on the website of Spain’s CNMV, the Italian group said it was leaving the door open to changing the bid to an all-cash offer.
Atlantia, controlled by Italy’s Benetton family, also said in the document it would sell a portion of Abertis’s 34 percent shareholding in telecom masts company Cellnex (CLNX.MC) to avoid having to make a full bid for Cellnex.
It also repeated it was ready to sell Abertis’s satellites business Hispasat if requested by the Spanish government.",fake
2693,Don't Hold Your Breath,"By Charles Hugh Smith
The demise of the U.S. dollar has been a staple of the financial media for decades. The latest buzzword making the rounds is de-dollarization, which describes the move away from USD in global payments.
De-dollarization is often equated with the demise of the dollar, but this reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of the currency markets.
Look, I get it: the U.S. dollar arouses emotions because it’s widely seen as one of the more potent tools of U.S. hegemony. Lots of people are hoping for the demise of the dollar, for all sorts of reasons that have nothing to do with the actual flow of currencies or the role of currencies in the global economy and foreign exchange (FX) markets.
So there is a large built-in audience for any claim that the dollar is on its deathbed.
I understand the emotional appeal of this, but investors and traders can’t afford to make decisions on the emotional appeal of superficial claims–not just in the FX markets, but in any markets.
So let’s ground the discussion of the demise of the USD in some basic fundamentals. Now would be a good time to refill your beverage/drip-bag because we’re going to cover some dynamics that require both emotional detachment and focus.
First, forget what currency we’re talking about. If the USD raises your hackles, then substitute quatloos for USD.
There are three basic uses for currency:
1. International payments. This can be thought of as flow: if I buy a load of bat guano and the seller demands payment in quatloos, I convert my USD to quatloos–a process that is essentially real-time–render payment, and I’m done with the FX part of the transaction.
It doesn’t matter what currency I start with or what currency I convert my payment into to satisfy the seller–I only hold that currency long enough to complete the transaction: a matter of seconds.
If sellers demand I use quatloos, pesos, rubles or RMB for those few moments, the only thing that matters is the availability of the currency and the exchange rate in those few moments.
2. Foreign reserves. Nation-states keep reserves for a variety of reasons, one being to support their own currency if imbalances occur that push their currency in unwanted directions.
The only nations that don’t need to hold much in the way of currency reserves are those that issue a reserve currency–a so-called “hard currency” that is stable enough and issued in sufficient size to be worth holding in reserve.
3. Debt. Everybody loves to borrow money. We know this because global debt keeps rising at a phenomenal rate, in every sector: government (public), corporate and household (private sectors). (See chart below.)",credible

1398,Why does Indian PM Narendra Modi follow trolls on Twitter?,"Image copyright Getty Images
Award-winning Indian actor Prakash Raj recently joined the long list of people asking why Prime Minister Narendra Modi follows trolls on Twitter.
The actor said he was upset when he saw some people rejoicing on social media after the recent murder of his friend, journalist Gauri Lankesh.
He added that he was even more upset to find out that some of these abusive trolls were being followed by Mr Modi.
""Some people who are followed by our prime minister on Twitter are so brutal, and we have a PM who has closed his eyes to it,"" Raj said, adding that he was ""disturbed, hurt... afraid of the silence of my prime minister"".
The backlash from the trolls was swift, they immediately dubbed him ""anti-Modi"" and he was criticised for his comment.
The Indian prime minister is among the most popular global leaders on Twitter, with more than 35 million followers. He is a prolific tweeter and most of his tweets are about his official work, government policies, or issues close to his heart like the clean India campaign.
The clever social media strategy of his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is regarded as one of the main factors behind the party's sweeping win in the 2014 elections.
However, there has been criticism that he is selective and non-inclusive in his tweets.
Image copyright Suhaimi Abdullah Image caption Award-winning actor Prakash Raj recently asked why PM Narendra Modi followed trolls on Twitter
For instance, his silence after a Muslim man was lynched by cow vigilantes in April for transporting cattle in Rajasthan was questioned by many - and a week after the incident, many ridiculed him for tweeting grief over an attack in Stockholm.
But for months now, critics have been wondering whether a more important question is not what the prime minister is tweeting, but what he is reading?
Or, more precisely, who he is reading?
""A huge majority of the 1,845 people that Mr Modi follows are politicians, bureaucrats and journalists, but a significant number of them are people who denigrate critics and political opponents in most horrendous language,"" Pratik Sinha of Alt News, a website set up to fight fake news in India, told the BBC.
""Most of them are BJP ground workers for whom a follow from the prime minister is a badge of honour, a recognition of their work,"" Mr Sinha said, adding that, ""most are crass misogynists who use the worst possible language.""
Take for example some of the tweets after Gauri Lankesh was shot dead - this Hindi tweet from Nikhil Dadhich, a Surat-based businessman who is followed by PM Modi, roughly translates as: ""A bitch died a dog's death and all of her litter is crying in the same voice."" Mr Dadhich's offending post was deleted after the uproar and is no longer available on his timeline.
Image copyright Twitter
Then there was this from Ashish Mishra, also followed by the PM, who commented ""Jaisi karni vaisi bharni [As you sow, so shall you reap]"" while re-tweeting a newspaper announcement of Ms Lankesh's murder:
Their vicious responses came in for much criticism and so did the fact that Mr Modi followed these - and other, similar - accounts.
Some angry Indians even began a #BlockNarendraModi campaign and although it did not get the wide support the prime minister's critics had hoped for, it did create a buzz in India.
After several people tweeted that they had blocked Mr Modi's personal account, the head of the BJP's IT cell Amit Malviya issued a statement saying ""PM following someone is not a character certificate"" for that person.
Image copyright Twitter
Pratik Sinha of Alt News says Mr Malviya is not entirely honest in his assertion that the prime minister's account has never blocked or unfollowed anyone and that Mr Modi did unfollow a former supporter, Dr Jwala Gurunath, after she accused a BJP spokesperson of unethical behaviour.
While writing this article, I called Mr Malviya to ask him some questions about the prime minister's Twitter account, but he refused to answer. ""I have issued a statement and I have nothing more to add to it,"" he told me.
The prime minister is a busy man who has a million things to do, and Mr Sinha says it is unlikely that he spends a lot of time on Twitter or even operates his own account.
But, according to reports, Mr Modi reaches for his iPad within minutes of waking up and spends some time looking at his social media feed, and critics say considering the vitriol unleashed by some of his supporters, his silence is troubling.
It has been over a month since Gauri Lankesh was shot dead outside her home. No-one has been arrested by the police. And no-one has been unfollowed by the prime minister.
""I've also been asking why can't Mr Modi unfollow these people. But I realise that it's part of their political strategy,"" Mr Sinha says.
""These people are not really trolls. They are much more important than that, they are the party's foot soldiers on Twitter,"" he adds.",fake
3705,Trump team kicks the Clean Power Plan into the long grass,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The Trump White House is determined to revive the fortunes of US coal at all costs
In California and the western US, wildfires made more likely by climate change, continue to rage in the vineyards and forests.
In President Trump's Washington, a bonfire of climate regulations is also burning brightly.
""The war on coal is over,"" EPA administrator Scott Pruitt told an audience in Kentucky yesterday, as he announced his intention to sign a rule rolling back the Clean Power Plan (CPP).
So is this just another angry white man, lashing out at the ""global climate conspiracy"", determined to turn the clock back to the golden age of anthracite?
Mr Pruitt would robustly deny it.
Along with many other republican attorneys general, and several industry bodies, he sees the CPP as a significant over-reach by the Federal government.
Rather than just requiring coal fired power plants to improve the efficiency of their operations, critics say it put the onus on them to go further and invest in renewables such as wind and solar power.
""The past administration was using every bit of power and authority to use the EPA to pick winners and losers in how we generate electricity in this country,"" Mr Pruitt said.
""That's wrong.""
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Scott Pruitt is presented with a coal miner's helmet at a mine in Pennsylvania
However, many experts take issue with that analysis.
""The CPP was written with maximum flexibility,"" said Tim Profeta, director of Duke University's Nicholas Institute for Environmental Policy Solutions.
""All the federal government did was set a target and it gave complete discretion to the state on how to hit the target. There was no picking of technology.""
While shooting down the CPP on the disputed grounds that it favours one form of power generation over others, the Trump administration's energy department seems to be doing something very similar.
""A diverse mix of power generation resources, including those with on-site reserves, is essential to the reliable delivery of electricity - particularly in times of supply stress such as recent natural disasters,"" said Energy Secretary Rick Perry in a statement announcing a new regulation on the security of electricity supply.
""My proposal will strengthen American energy security by ensuring adequate reserve resource supply.""
The phrase ""adequate resource supply"" is understood to mean that nuclear power and older coal fired plants will be given extra money to ensure that the lights stay on.
Many researchers say this is not necessary. They point to states like Texas, where since 2008 wind power has grown to account for 13% of the electricity mix, while coal generation has fallen by 24%.
Observers say this ""retro"" approach to climate change and energy springs from the President's election campaign.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption President Trump greets EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt on the day he announced US withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement
""The core of the Trump support truly doubts the need to act on climate change, and really sees it as an attempted government over reach,"" said Tim Profeta.
""The reason President Trump is our president is because of the real cry of pain from the mid-west and our manufacturing belt that feels left behind both economically and culturally.""
""That's what put him in the White House, and I think he is really trying to react to that and the decline of coal is very symbolic and he's trying to reverse that.""
However, this impetus to re-energise the coal sector comes into direct conflict with a legal imperative given to the EPA in a 2009 endangerment finding by the Supreme Court that ruled that CO2 was a pollutant and a danger to health.
Faced with these two contradictory pressures, Mr Pruitt has kicked for touch. The EPA will take public comments on what should happen replace the CPP. This will take at least a year.
They may then propose an amended and restricted version of the plan - or they may not.
Insiders say that another element helping the delay is Scott Pruitt's political ambitions in his home state of Oklahoma, a place hugely dependant on the oil and gas industry.
Mr Pruitt is determined, say sources, not to regulate CO2 during his term at the EPA. Despite this, he may not be able to hold back the tide. Renewable energy is cheaper than ever, natural gas is in abundant supply, and the US judiciary is firmly on the side of regulating carbon dioxide.
""The EPA can repeal the Clean Power Plan but not the laws of economics,"" former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg tweeted.
""This won't revive coal or stop the US from reaching our Paris goal.""
Tim Profeta agrees with this analysis.
""The facts are stubborn, we have the legal authority, the public sentiment is there for action, it's just not intense enough to make President Trump care.""
""But I think eventually this nation will get to the right place.""

2651,2018 Projection: Will Robinson Cano Return to Elite Levels?,"2018 Projection: Will Robinson Cano Return to Elite Levels?
(Before It's News)
by Eric Stashin (aka The Rotoprofessor)
We all know that there was a time that Robinson Cano was one of the elite second baseman in the game, and after rebounding to hit 39 HR in 2016 the hope was that he still belonged in that class. It shouldn’t have come as a surprise that he fell short in 2017, posting the following line:
592 At Bats
.280 Batting Average (166 Hits)
23 Home Runs
97 RBI
79 Runs
1 Stolen Bases
.338 On Base Percentage
.453 Slugging Percentage
.294 Batting Average on Balls in Play
Obviously the average was solid and he was able to drive in runs, but he’ll be 35-years old at the start of the 2018 season. Can we really expect significant production? Can his power rebound once again?
Rebound may not be the right word, as 2016 always looked like an aberration given his production since signing with Seattle:
2014 – 14 HR
2015 – 21 HR
2016 – 39 HR
2017 – 23 HR
Of course he also continued to be more of a groundball hitter, with a 50.0% mark in ’17 (he’s been at 50% or greater in three of the past four seasons). Considering the home ballpark and his overall career 14.5% HR/FB, expecting the power to remain in this type of level should be reasonable.
The real question should be if he can continue posting a viable average, as well as driving in 90+ runs. Over the past two seasons he’s posted line drive rates below 20% (18.0% and 19.4%), though a strong second half with a 24.5% line drive rate does give hope. He hit .286 after the All-Star Break, due to a .322 BABIP, and seeing him continue to hit .280+ (.305 career hitter) is extremely reasonable.
With that type of average, moderate power and a strong lineup around him the RBI should also be there to an extent. He was extremely lucky with men on base (.350 BABIP, leading to a .343 batting average), and that means a bit of a regression is likely in order. Could he pick up 90 RBI? That’s a realistic number, but pushing 100 is unlikely.
It all comes together for the following projection:
.288 (180-625), 24 HR, 90 RBI, 80 R, 0 SB, .305 BABIP, .340 OBP, .464 SLG
That’s a usable line, obviously, but he’s hardly among the elite in the game at this point. Consider him more of a low-end second base option, given the relative lack of upside. With someone more likely to pay for the name, as opposed to the potential production, be cautious.

3160,Cubs Beat Nationals as a Bloop Cancels Out a Blunder,"And a lot of consternation for the Nationals, who on Tuesday face elimination from a round in which they also lost in 2012, 2014 and 2016. In 13 seasons since moving from Montreal, they still have not advanced in the postseason.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
The Nationals have already determined that Stephen Strasburg will not start on short rest for Game 4 — “Stras has never done it; we’re not going to experiment at this point,” the pitching coach, Mike Maddux, said on Sunday — and will start Tanner Roark against Jake Arrieta.
Unless they start hitting, though, little else matters. Washington had the best on-base-plus-slugging percentage in the National League this season, but their hitters have a .121 average and a meager .431 O.P.S. in this series. They have scored in just three of 26 innings.
Photo
“They continue to get the clutch hits,” Nationals Manager Dusty Baker said of the Cubs. “We haven’t gotten them yet. But we will.”
The Nationals did get them in Game 2, with homers by Bryce Harper and Ryan Zimmerman powering a comeback victory. Baker had hoped his team would build off it, but for most of Monday his lineup looked feeble against Jose Quintana and three relievers.
The last 10 Washington hitters went down in order, and without Schwarber’s sixth-inning gaffe — he dropped Daniel Murphy’s two-out fly ball, then kicked it for another error as Murphy reached third — the Cubs might have pitched another shutout. They did so in Game 1, 3-0, behind Kyle Hendricks and the bullpen.
In that game, the Cubs had no hits off Strasburg until the sixth inning yet capitalized on an error by Anthony Rendon to win. On Monday, Scherzer allowed no hits until his final batter, Ben Zobrist, doubled with one out in the seventh.
Scherzer had thrown 98 pitches and had planned for no more than 100 as he recovers from a hamstring injury. Baker said he also worried that the next hitter, the left-handed Schwarber, might belt a go-ahead homer. He called for a left-hander, Sammy Solis, who allowed a game-tying single to Albert Almora, a right-handed pinch-hitter, on a full-count changeup.
Baker said he did not consider using Brandon Kintzler against Schwarber, because Kintzler throws sinkers and he feared that Schwarber — who likes pitches away — could lift one into the left-field seats. Baker never used his two best late-inning relievers, Ryan Madson or Sean Doolittle.

“Sammy Solis was the best option for us,” Scherzer told reporters. “I know that you guys are going to second-guess that, but these guys are here to make a decision. When they made that decision, I wasn’t going to override anybody.
“These are pressure-packed situations and they’ve done their homework and they’ve done their job to come up with the best scenario in that situation,” Scherzer added. “Dusty all year has done that for us. They’re making the best decision for the team, and when they made that decision I was behind it as well. I was juiced out of my mind with adrenaline.”

So was the crowd at Wrigley Field, where the Cubs played for the first time ever in the postseason as defending World Series champions. For Rizzo’s go-ahead hit, the crowd was so loud that it may have affected the Nationals’ fielders.
Kintzler, who took over for Solis in the seventh, started the eighth by walking Tommy La Stella. The pinch-runner Leonys Martin took second on a bunt by Jon Jay, and Kris Bryant struck out. Baker removed Kintzler for Perez, who had induced a double-play grounder from Rizzo in Game 2.
This time, though, Rizzo punched a first-pitch fastball in the air. It hung in the twilight sky like a punt at Soldier Field, finally falling between shortstop Trea Turner, left fielder Jayson Werth and center fielder Michael A. Taylor.

“I felt like I really didn’t have a chance at it, and I went back and looked and maybe I did,” Werth said, after reviewing the play on video with Taylor. “But in the moment, it was a tough ball for somebody to call and get to because you’re not going to hear it.”
As the center fielder, Taylor said, he should have taken charge. He said he wished he had dived, but hesitated because he thought the speedy Turner might have been camped under it. But the outfielders, with the ball in front of them, had a better view than the shortstop.
“They definitely had better angles at it,” Turner said. “I’m twisting and turning, and he hit it in a perfect spot.”
Then again, perhaps Rizzo should not have been hitting at all. With first base open, Baker could have ordered an intentional walk to bring up Willson Contreras, who had homered in Game 2. Rizzo took the decision personally, screaming, “Respect me!” after his hit.
“I want to make guys pay,” said Rizzo, adding that his job is to drive in runs. “That’s the mentality. I believe I’m a really good hitter. I believe I’m one of the best hitters in the game, and you have to believe that. There’s a lot of power that comes with that.”

Shared this stat in discussing outstanding performances here against the Jaguars but it’s worth repeating. After giving up 7 passing touchdowns of 40 yards or more last season, the longest passing TD the Jets have allowed this season was the 3-yard TD thrown by Jay Cutler against the Dolphins as time expired. It’s early, but hard not to be impressed with what the secondary has done thus far.
against the Jaguars but it’s worth repeating. After giving up 7 passing touchdowns of 40 yards or more last season, the longest passing TD the Jets have allowed this season was the 3-yard TD thrown by Jay Cutler against the Dolphins as time expired. It’s early, but hard not to be impressed with what the secondary has done thus far. Todd Bowles can defend Mo Wilkerson all he wants, but his film and results speak for themselves. Wilkerson looks uninterested in being on the football field. The result? Zero sacks through four games for $18 million. In fact, over his past 20 games, Wilkerson has picked up just 4.5 sacks. In the 20 prior to that, 19 of which were before his new contract, he had 13.5.
When GM Mike Maccagnan signed quarterback Josh McCown, fans in favor of a winless season touted his 2-20 record over his previous 22 starts as reason to believe the Jets were a lock for the top pick. That changed in a hurry, didn’t it?
Still no word on wide receiver Jalin Marshall who is eligible to return from suspension this week. Fans don’t seem to be high on the second-year player, but from the way Todd Bowles has treated Marshall, you get the feeling he’ll do everything he can to keep him on the roster. If he returns, look for the Jets to part with a tight end with five currently on the roster.
Jalin Marshall is eligible to return from his suspension this week
Not much was expected of the Jets this season, but if they can’t find a way to beat Deshone Kizer and the Browns, a lot of the progress that was made over the past two weeks will mean very little. Kizer has made a decent throw here and there, but has been largely ineffective, holding on to the ball too long and missing open receivers when he has a clean pocket. If Mo Wilkerson is going to get a sack at all this season, this is the week to do it.
Of the five tight ends currently on the roster, one of them is rookie Jordan Leggett who has yet to appear in a game due to a knee injury that the team is saying very little about. The rookie says there’s no need to worry, but if the team stays mum and he’s not on the field in the coming weeks, could you blame anyone for doing just that?

3684,Virginia Tech is right on schedule despite loss to Clemson.,"Virginia Tech is right on schedule despite loss to Clemson.
(Before It's News)
Sometimes after a loss to anyone there can be tendency to ask, what’s wrong, why did we lose, etc etc. Virginia Tech lost Saturday night to Clemson 31-17, but Hokie fans should still very encouraged by their program direction.
Let’s be honest Clemson is just at another level from the rest of college football save Alabama right now. I’m saying it right now, this Clemson team is better than last year’s national championship team. Last season was more about incredible individual talents like Mike Williams and Deshaun Watson. This season Clemson is a more complete team with a defense that is simply frightening. This Hokie team isn’t really competing with Clemson at the moment, but I believe they will be down the road.
We’ve seen the Virginia Tech program win 10 games in it’s first year under Justin Fuente. DC Bud Foster’s record speaks for itself. They started this year beating a good West Virginia team and dominanting the rest of their schedule until Saturday night. Coaching wise Virginia Tech is near or at the level of Clemson.
Player for player though Clemson is a measuring stick for where Virginia Tech is trying to get. It’s a very simple matter for the Hokies – recruit, recruit and recruit some more. Josh Jackson is a young, talented QB that Virginia Tech can build around. In year 2, it was probably asking too much for Virginia Tech to beat a team of Clemson’s caliber. Give it a couple of more years under Fuente, the Hokies are on the rise and right on schedule.

663,Harvey Weinstein sacked after sexual harassment claims,"Image copyright AFP
Harvey Weinstein, the Oscar-winning film producer accused of sexually harassing female employees, has been fired by the board of his company.
One of the biggest producers in Hollywood, Mr Weinstein was behind films including Shakespeare in Love, The King's Speech and Pulp Fiction.
The Weinstein Company directors said that ""in light of new information about misconduct"" his employment had been terminated ""effective immediately"".
Mr Weinstein had been informed.
His sudden departure comes after the New York Times published a report last week about sexual harassment claims dating back nearly three decades.
The 65-year-old apologised and said he planned to take a leave of absence.
""The way I've behaved with colleagues in the past has caused a lot of pain, and I sincerely apologise for it,"" Mr Weinstein said.
However, he later disputed the report, which said he had reached at least eight settlements with women, and vowed to take legal action.
Speaking up
Mr Weinstein is one of the most powerful men in Hollywood, having co-founded the Miramax and Weinstein Company production firms.
The allegations against him, according to the New York Times report, emerged mainly from young women hoping to break into the film industry and included celebrities Ashley Judd and Rose McGowan.
Among the accusations levelled against the film producer are that he forced women to massage him and watch him naked. In return for sexual favours, he promised to help advance their careers, they said.
President Donald Trump said on Saturday he was ""not at all surprised"" by the revelations about Mr Weinstein, a major backer of Democratic candidates.
Many Democratic lawmakers have since vowed to give their contributions from Mr Weinstein to charity. Mr Trump faced his own sex scandal last year when video emerged of him using lewd language to describe groping women.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Weinstein has two children with wife Georgina Chapman
Mr Weinstein, who is married to English fashion designer Georgina Chapman, formed the Miramax production house in the late 1970s with his brother and then sold it to Disney.
The pair went on to create The Weinstein Company and produce such hits as Django Unchained, Lion and The Butler.
The Weinstein Company statement was issued on Sunday by the firm's all-male board, Bob Weinstein, Lance Maerov, Richard Koenigsberg and Tarak Ben Ammar.
'Mistakes'
His departure leaves control of the company in the hands of his brother, Bob Weinstein, and chief operating officer David Glasser.
Actress Rose McGowan called on the Weinstein board to resign immediately over the allegations.
""Men in Hollywood need to change ASAP,"" she told The Hollywood Reporter. ""Hollywood's power is dying because society has changed and grown, and yet Hollywood male behaviour has not.""
Feminist author Naomi Wolf said his sacking was ""a landmark in penalties for this kind of eruption of testimony"" against a powerful man.
Last week Mr Weinstein's lawyer, Lisa Bloom, said that he denied many of the allegations made against him as ""patently false"".
""He has acknowledged mistakes he has made,"" said Ms Bloom. ""He is reading books and going to therapy. He is an old dinosaur learning new ways.""
But on Saturday, Ms Bloom said in a tweet that she was no longer advising Mr Weinstein.
""I have resigned as an advisor to Harvey Weinstein,"" the tweet said. ""My understanding is that Mr Weinstein and his board are moving to an agreement.""",fake
1066,How Europe’s Last Dictatorship Became a Tech Hub,"Ten days after the awards, Facebook bought the company for an undisclosed sum. The founders, whose average age was about 25 at the time, moved to London and the United States. Together with some of those co-workers, Mr. Kovalyov is developing a new Minsk start-up, AR Squad, which creates augmented reality content.
One of the first masks the other company developed was one resembling Aleksandr G. Lukashenko, Belarus’s president, who has ruled for more than two decades. He is prone to publicity stunts like picking potatoes at his estate or taking his teenage son, Nikolai, commonly referred to as Kolya, to sit at international meetings in a military uniform.
Photo
Mr. Lukashenko’s mask featured his trademark comb-over hair and bushy mustache, but was not considered offensive. On the contrary, Mr. Lukashenko began to believe that the tech industry could become a magic wand to help him end the country’s chronic dependency on Russia.
“Creation of an IT state is our ambitious but reachable goal,” Mr. Lukashenko said at a gathering of lawmakers and bureaucrats this summer. “This will allow us to make Belarus even more modern and prosperous and will let Belarusians look into the future with confidence.”
Mr. Lukashenko, who once called the internet “a pile of garbage,” began to utter improbable words for a former manager of a collective farm — about the need to develop artificial intelligence, driverless cars and blockchain technology, which allows multiple parties to keep shared digital records.
His government has taken several steps to encourage the tech industry’s development, like granting visa-free entry to citizens of 79 countries, including all Western states, when entering through the Minsk airport. Mr. Lukashenko also wants to lift restrictions on currency transfers to encourage venture financing for start-ups.

Belarus produces top-level technical talent, an inheritance from its Soviet past, said Arkady M. Dobkin, who immigrated to the United States in the 1990s and established a software company there.

Today, Mr. Dobkin is the chief executive of EPAM, which does programing for the world’s leading tech companies and is considered one of the fastest-growing public tech companies in the world.
EPAM’s headquarters is in Newtown, Pa., but its main development hub is in Minsk, where more than 6,000 of its technology specialists work.
“I think it was the absence of oil that made Belarus do this,” said Mr. Dobkin, 57. “Here, universities produce more highly qualified specialists than the internal market needs.”
Many locals say the government’s talk about growing as a tech hub is a comfortable distraction in a country that heavily depends on Russia for cut-rate fuel and political patronage.
Sergei Chaly, an outspoken economist and former government official, calls Belarus “a dying country with bitcoins.”
Photo
Vladimir Lipkovich, a popular blogger who made a career out of ridiculing Belarusian bureaucrats, said the only reason the tech industry had found some success in Belarus is that the government “cannot seize people’s brains.” He joked, “If they want to capture an IT company, what would they get, computers?”
Politics doesn’t seem a big concern for many in the tech crowd, even if young political activists use group chats on the call and messaging app Viber — an Israeli company whose development hub is in Minsk — to coordinate activities and plan rallies.

Tanks have an important cultural meaning for Belarus and other former Soviet states, where almost every family has an ancestor who fought in one.
“He plays tanks, but this is controlled,” Mr. Lukashenko said of his son at a televised meeting with schoolteachers.
“One hour for tanks, 1.5 hours for music,” the president added, explaining how he controls his son’s time spent on the game. “Two hours for tanks — four hours for music.”
“Four hours is difficult,” Mr. Lukashenko said, “so he doesn’t play for longer than one hour.”",fake

As Hollywood moved to distance itself from Weinstein, Streep said she had been appalled by the claims made against the film studio executive she once likened to “God” in a 2012 awards speech.
His “behavior is inexcusable, but the abuse of power familiar,” Streep said a statement.
Britain’s Dench, who won a supporting actress Oscar in 1999 for the Weinstein-produced film “Shakespeare in Love,” said in a statement she was “completely unaware of these offences, which are of course horrifying.”
Stars like Streep and Dench, whose movies had been championed by Weinstein, have been under pressure to speak out after a New York Times investigation last week detailed claims by multiple women of unwanted physical contact by Weinstein over three decades.
Weinstein, 65, initially apologized but later threatened to sue over the allegations uncovered by the newspaper. He has not been charged with any crimes but was fired on Sunday as co-chairman of the Weinstein amid fallout from the Times story.

“The disgraceful news about Harvey Weinstein has appalled those of us whose work he championed,” Streep said.

Producer and director Kevin Smith said on Monday he regretted taking money from Weinstein’s production company.
“He financed the first 14 years of my career - and now I know while I was profiting, others were in terrible pain. It makes me feel ashamed,” Smith, known for the comedies “Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back” and “Clerks,” wrote on Twitter.
Actresses Ashley Judd and Rose McGowan have said Weinstein sexually harassed them and movie director Judd Apatow and producer Megan Ellison are among those have spoken out in support of them.
Weinstein is the latest U.S. media or entertainment industry titan to face sexual harassment accusations. At Fox News, late Chief Executive Officer Roger Ailes was forced out in 2016 and anchor Bill O‘Reilly resigned in April after similar claims.

2131,Ranking the Power 5 Football Conferences after Week 3 with Playoff Analysis,"Ranking the Power 5 Football Conferences after Week 3 with Playoff Analysis
% of readers think this story is Fact. Add your two cents.
(Before It's News)
While the playoff committee doesn’t rank the power 5 conference, there is no way conference strength – which means OOC results doesnt figure in to a committee members thought process.
Let me point out on my philosophy on these rankings – your most recent OOC results count a lot, and you’ll see me reference that throughout the season.
We’ll give each conference a relative strength value 1-10.
Let me explain my relative rankings
0-5 : Conference lacks depth no elite teams
6-7: Conference lacks depth, and there are 1-2 elite teams, and 1-2 quality teams
7-8: At least 2 elite teams, and at least 2 quality teams.
8-9: 3 elite teams, and at least 2 quality teams
9-10: 1/2 of conference is elite and/or quality teams.
1) Pac 12 – 7.7
Last week provided no real answers about how to rank to the Power 5 conferences. So there’s no reason to modify the rankings from week 3. We’ll stick with the Pac 12 as number 1 due to their 6-2 record against the rest Power 5, but that doesn’t mean there weren’t some ugly results for the Pac 12 last week.
Two ranked Pac 12 teams UCLA and Stanford went down to group of 5 opponents Memphis and San Diego State. California did pick up a nice win over Ole Miss, and USC beat Texas.
Playoff contenders USC and Washington face tricky in-conference opponents Cal and Colorado this week.
Playoff Contenders
USC, Washington
In the Playoff Picture
Utah, Washington State
2) SEC – 7.6
The SEC went a pedestrian 1-2 against the Power 5 last week. Ole Miss lost to Cal, and Missouri got blown out by Purdue. Let’s give Vanderbilt credit for a huge win over a previously ranked Kansas State.
LSU plays Syracuse this week, and I think that game will get ugly for the Orange. The loser of Mississippi State and Georgia will leave the SEC struggling for playoff contenders outside of Alabama. Keep an eye on Alabama vs Vanderbilt this week. If Vanderbilt wins are they SEC’s best team? I’m serious…
Playoff Contenders
Alabama
In the Playoff Picture
Georgia, Mississippi State
3) ACC – 7.6
No surprise Pitt got trounced by Oklahoma State, but Duke did knock off Baylor this past week. Boston College lost to Notre Dame. Clemson looks like one of the country’s 3 best teams after routing Louisville.
The ACC has the 4 top 15 teams the most of any conference.
Syracuse vs LSU is the only OOC matchup.
Playoff Contenders
Clemson
In the Playoff Picture
Miami, Virginia Tech, Florida State
3) Big 10 – 7.5
Rough week for the Big 10 as Nebraska took an embarrassing home loss to North Illinois, and Illinois got routed by South Florida. Purdue did beat Missouri.
The conference lacks any surefire playoff teams at the moment.
This week Notre Dame plays Michigan State, and Maryland has an interesting game with UCF.
Playoff Contenders
NONE
In the Playoff Picture
Penn State, Wisconsin, Michigan
5) Big 12 – 7.3
I said the Big 12 had to go 3-2 in OOC Power 5 games last week to move them up. They went 2-3. Oklahoma State did beat Pitt and Texas Tech defeated Arizona State. Texas played well but lost to USC. Baylor went down to Duke, and surprisingly Kansas State lost to Vanderbilt. Oh yea Kansas lost to Ohio… ouch
Texas Tech plays Houston this week, and a game with playoff implications TCU squares off with Oklahoma State.
Playoff Contenders
Oklahoma
In the Playoff Picture
Oklahoma State, TCU
The Rest
Unless a Group of 5 or independent team can reach the top 15, there’s not much to note outside the Power 5 in terms of the playoff.
Playoff Contenders
NONE
In the Playoff Picture
NONE
My Current Playoff Teams
As my personal criticism of the playoff committee, I don’t think the top 4 seeds order should be released until the final rankings. The playoff committee’s inconsistent and ever changing criteria is causing unnecessary frustration and confusion. It’s one of the improvement points I’d have for them.
If I had a vote this is who I would put in the playoff right now.
In – Oklahoma | Alabama | Clemson | USC
Just Missed – 5) Washington 6) Penn State 7) Oklahoma State 8) Wisconsin

1115,Mike Freeman's 10-Point Stance: Put a Fork in the Giants; They're Done,"Joe Robbins/Getty Images
We're a quarter of the way through the season, and Brandon Marshall and the Giants are done, there are questions about Joe Flacco, and the Patriots defense is a mess. What is going on around here?
1. Giant Problems
I reached out to several Giants players this week, and the response I got was...interesting.
Nothing. Nada. Zip.
And these are guys who always text back. I tried one of the coaches, also a reliable respondent. Again, nothing. Seems the Giants have engaged their caterpillar drive.
This type of silence is usually a bad sign. It often means people don't want to talk because they might say too much.
The Giants are 0-4, and the chaos inside that locker room must be extreme. This is a proud organization that, unlike some other franchises, despises losing on a genetic level. These aren't the Chargers. Giants owner John Mara, the son of the legendary Hall of Fame owner Wellington, is a mild-mannered man but is as competitive a person as there is in football.
What's happened? This isn't a mystery to people around the league, who say they see an Eli Manning who looks old and an offense that doesn't have a lot of talent outside of Odell Beckham Jr.
The most scathing criticism, however, is focused on the signing of Brandon Marshall to be the team's No. 2 receiver. He was supposed to ease double-teams on Beckham, but he hasn't. Not even close. On the contrary, Marshall has hurt the offense significantly because of how much he has slowed down and how unreliable he has become as a pass-catcher.
""I think it's over for Brandon,"" one team executive told B/R. ""I think it was over for him last year.""
Marshall himself acknowledged he's ""just not playing well right now,"" per ESPN.com's Jordan Raanan. ""I haven't played a solid game since I've been here.""
Brian Blanco/Getty Images
To blame all the woes on Marshall, though, would be foolish. There is essentially a talent drain across the offense with the exception of one player.
The Giants haven't scored a single point in the first quarter this season and have trailed by at least 10 points in each game so far. Sometimes, the problem isn't all that complicated to diagnose.
The Giants don't make personnel changes easily. This is an organization that's had just three general managers since the 1980s. Still, most NFL team sources interviewed believe that if the Giants don't make the playoffs this season there will be massive overhaul of the coaching staff and possibly the front office. The franchise is loyal, but only to a point.
Mara isn't going to take kindly to a team that started 0-4 and didn't make the playoffs. He's patient and fair but not that patient and fair. And if the team loses this week to a winless Chargers club...hoo boy.
It may already be too late. Only one team ever has started 0-4 and made the playoffs: the 1992 Chargers.
""We've got to get that first win, and you go from there. You never know what can happen,"" said Manning, via James Kratch for NJ.com. ""We still feel like we're a good team that can win a lot of games.
""Well, let's make history and be the second team. That's the only thing we can worry about. ... Let's give ourselves a chance. No one knows what's going to happen, but if we don't start winning soon, we will know what's going to happen.""
2. Is Joe Flacco Still Elite?
Patrick McDermott/Getty Images
Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco long has been honest and blunt. It's one of many things I've always liked about him. And he didn't edit himself when B/R reached him after a loss to the Steelers in which he threw two picks and looked terrible, as he has for much of this season.
""I sucked,"" Flacco told me. ""I mean, you know, it wasn't good.""
Flacco finished with a 64.6 passer rating. But the truth is, Flacco hasn't looked good in a while.
Of course, Flacco isn't the sole reason for the Ravens' offensive woes. But he's the quarterback, and that means he gets most of the credit when the offense rolls, and the blame when it struggles.
And why has he struggled? I can't pinpoint one reason, based on interviews with players who have gone against him. But there is a general feeling that Flacco, while doing himself no favors, also hasn't been served by Baltimore's mediocre offensive weapons.
This isn't to say there are no options but that there's no Rob Gronkowski or Todd Gurley walking through that door at M&T Bank Stadium.
That is as big a problem for the Ravens as Flacco.
3. When in Baltimore, Do as the Raven Once Did
Many opposing players, when in Baltimore, now imitate the famous (or infamous) Ray Lewis celebration after they make a good defensive play. They mock it, actually.
But no one has explained why they do it as well as Steelers linebacker Ryan Shazier, who mimicked the Lewis dance after he intercepted Flacco on Sunday.
""We're in Baltimore, and I wanted to celebrate Ray Lewis-style,"" Shazier said. ""Our goal is to be the No. 1 defense, and Ray Lewis has a great legacy of being a great defensive player. Plus, he always had a great rivalry with the Steelers. At the same time, I tried to make the home team a little mad, because it feels pretty good to win.""
4. Where Cooler Heads Prevail
Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images
After Ravens and Steelers players heard boos in Baltimore when some Ravens knelt and prayed before the national anthem played, both sides reacted in a manner that was measured and smart.
""We knew it was possible that we were going to get [booed],"" Ravens linebacker Terrell Suggs said. ""We just wanted to show to our fans that we still do stand in solidarity. We don't want [anyone] to lose the narrative of why we're doing it. We don't want people to think that we're disrespecting the flag or military, or anything like that. It was pretty much that we still wanted to show solidarity.""
Said Ravens tight end Benjamin Watson: ""It's their prerogative to boo or not boo. Fans pay for their ticket, and they get to say what they want to say. We decided as a team to just have a moment of silence with everything that's going on. We wanted to pray for unity, we wanted to show the unity amongst each other, and that's what we decided to do.""
And after making news in Week 3 when he alone stood for the anthem outside the Steelers tunnel, left tackle Alejandro Villanueva tried to find some perspective after a tumultuous few weeks in the NFL: ""At this point, this whole kneeling or standing up is a much bigger issue than what we're asking for as a league. We're trying to be conscious of social issues. We're also trying to be respectful of the flag. ... I respect every single player in the NFL. Every single citizen has their rights. I am not into the politics of the game. I'm just a football player.""
5. Move the Chains, Win the Games
Stephen Dunn/Getty Images
The Eagles offense is rolling. It ranks third in total yards through Week 4 and seventh in points per game.
Why?
It is converting on third downs, that's why. It's (partly) that simple.
Against the Chargers on Sunday, the Eagles converted nine of 16 third-down opportunities, or 56.3 percent. The Eagles say that is the team's ninth-highest third-down conversion rate since 1991.
In 2017, Philly has converted 30 of 59 third downs, or 50.8 percent, and has been successful on at least 50 percent of their third-down attempts in three of their first four games of the season. The last time the Eagles accomplished that feat in as many games was in 1992 (all four games).
Move the chains, and you score points. Pretty easy to digest. And if the Eagles keep this up, they'll keep being hard to beat.
6. It's Elementary
Tim Warner/Getty Images
I'll get into why Deshaun Watson has been so good so fast soon, but first take a look at his passer ratings this season:
Week 1: 60.4
Week 2: 75.9
Week 3: 90.6
Week 4: 125.0
According to B/R research, the Texans quarterback became only the third rookie passer in NFL history with four or more passing touchdowns and one or more rushing touchdowns in a single game, joining Fran Tarkenton and Johnny Green.
It's early, and there will be bumps in the road, but clearly Watson gets it.
7. What Is Going On in New England?
Jim Rogash/Getty Images
Here's another gem from B/R research: The Patriots are the only team in the NFL to give up 250 or more passing yards in each of their first four games this season.
This has to infuriate Bill Belichick. Before anything, Belichick is a defensive genius, the best mind on the subject in the history of the sport. As the defensive coordinator for the Giants, he devised the scheme that stopped the unstoppable Bills passing game in Super Bowl XXV.
This is all a way of saying no one should expect the defensive woes of the Patriots to last long. Belichick won't let them.
8. Shields Up
The scene was incredibly odd. Marshawn Lynch, the Raiders veteran running back, took a seat on the bench during the anthem Sunday, as he has done before. This time, however, he was surrounded by team staffers trying to block the view.
Then Monday night, cornerback Kenneth Acker sat on the bench during the anthem, in protest, when one of his teammates attempted to shield him from an ESPN camera.
The motivation behind the shielding tactic is a mystery to me. My best guess is that players don't want images of them sitting used against them, but they also had to know that images of them sitting would be used against them.
9. Is That Mike Singletary? Nope, but Myles Jack May Be Getting Close
Frank Franklin II/Associated Press
One of the things scouts told me when linebacker Myles Jack came out of UCLA in 2016 was that his skill set would remind me of Hall of Famer Mike Singletary.
That's waayyyyyy too high a compliment for such a young player, of course. Singletary was a beast who destroyed running games.
Still, Jack is doing some amazing things in Jacksonville. This piece of data from Pro Football Focus says it all:
No, Jack isn't Singletary, but he's doing a nice impression.
10. A Question For You...
I'm going to ask a question. Don't get mad. Don't get snippy. Don't send me nasty notes. OK, here it goes.
This past week, two things happened that caused very different reactions in my social media nerd universe. The first was when Steelers receiver Antonio Brown beat the crap out of a Gatorade cooler. He was obliterated on social media for being a spoiled brat.
On the opposite end of the country, Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers completely wigged out. Rivers has done this before. He can be a petulant child.
On my Twitter feed I found two different reactions. It's anecdotal, but I think if you polled all sports fans they would have the same reactions. On one hand, Brown was considered a punk. On the other, Rivers was hailed as a competitor.
When Terry Bradshaw was going over highlights on Fox, he said this: ""The reason we're showing you this is to show you how selfish receivers can be. [Ben] Roethlisberger doesn't throw it to Brown. Brown pitches a fit. Acts like the spoiled brat that he probably is. And I'd sit him, I guarantee, for at least one play.""
So, now to my question: Why were the actions of Brown and Rivers viewed so differently?
Shoot me a note on Twitter, and I'll address this next week in this spot.
And be civil.

Rep. Daniel Zolnikov (R-Billings) sponsored House Bill 149 (HB149). The legislation prohibits the use of ALPRs except for specified purposes, and also places limitations on the retention and sharing of data gathered by license plate readers.
The Montana Senate passed HB149 by a 48-1 vote. The House concurred with a 91-7 vote, With Gov. Steve Bullock’s signature the law goes into effect Oct. 1.
Under the law, law enforcement agencies can only use ALPRs for specified law enforcement purposes. These include identifying stolen vehicles, locating missing persons, locating individuals with outstanding warrants, locating vehicles involved in homicides or other major crimes, and “case-specific investigative surveillance.”
Any data collected by an ALPR cannot be stored from more than 90 days without a preservation request, or a state or federal warrant. A preservation request will only be valid for one year and will have to be renewed for continuing data storage.
The original bill contained language prohibiting an ALPR system from photographing, recording, or producing images of the occupants of a vehicle. That was unfortunately removed during the committee process.
Even so, this law will prevent the state from creating permanent databases using information collected by ALPRs, and make it highly unlikely that such data will end up in federal databases.
IMPACT ON FEDERAL PROGRAMS
As reported in the Wall Street Journal, the federal government, via the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), tracks the location of millions of vehicles. They’ve engaged in this for over eight years, all without a warrant, or even public notice of the policy.
State and local law enforcement agencies operate most of these tracking systems, paid for by federal grant money. The DEA then taps into the local database to track the whereabouts of millions of people – for the simple act of driving – without having to operate a huge network itself.
Since a majority of federal license plate tracking data comes from state and local law enforcement, passage of this legislation takes a major step toward blocking that program from continuing in Montana. The feds can’t access data that doesn’t exist.
“No data means no federal license plate tracking program,” Tenth Amendment Center founder and executive director Michael Boldin said.
Law enforcement generally configures ALPRs to store the photograph, the license plate number, and the date, time, and location of vehicles. But according to newly disclosed records obtained by the ACLU via a Freedom of Information Act request, the DEA also captures photographs of drivers and their passengers.
According to the ACLU:
One internal 2009 DEA communication stated clearly that the license plate program can provide “the requester” with images that “may include vehicle license plate numbers (front and/or rear), photos of visible vehicle occupants [redacted] and a front and rear overall view of the vehicle.” Clearly showing that occupant photos are not an occasional, accidental byproduct of the technology, but one that is intentionally being cultivated, a 2011 email states that the DEA’s system has the ability to store “up to 10 photos per vehicle transaction including 4 occupant photos.
With the FBI rolling out facial a nationwide recognition program last fall, and the federal government building biometric databases, the fact that the feds can potentially access stored photographs of drivers and passengers, along with detailed location data, magnifies the privacy concerns surrounding ALPRs.
The new Montana ALPR limits take a good first step toward putting a big dent in federal plans to continue location tracking, and expanding its facial recognition program. The less data the state makes available to the federal government, the less ability they have to track people in Montana, and elsewhere.",credible
1745,Las Vegas hotel weighs fate of notorious 32nd floor suite,"FILE PHOTO: Workers board up a broken window at the Mandalay Bay hotel, where shooter Stephen Paddock conducted his mass shooting along the Las Vegas Strip, in Las Vegas, Nevada, U.S., October 6, 2017. REUTERS/Chris Wattie/File Photo
LAS VEGAS (Reuters) - What will become of the now-notorious Las Vegas hotel suite that a 64-year-old retiree used to stage the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history?
That is the difficult decision facing the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino a week after Stephen Paddock opened fire on a crowd at an outdoor concert from room 135 on the hotel’s 32nd floor, killing 58 and injuring more than 500.
The suite’s shattered gold-tinted windows are now discreetly covered over. The resort, owned by MGM Resorts International (MGM.N), has yet to say what it will do with the space.
The challenge is particularly difficult for a hotel in Las Vegas, a place where visitors go to escape everyday lives and real-world problems.
“How do they navigate the fact that this happened in their hotel?” said Andrea Trapani, managing partner at Identity, a Detroit-area public relations firm that provides crisis communications for hospitality brands. “A lot of challenging tough questions and decisions are going to be made.”
The hotel might want to consider sealing up Room 32-135, or even the entire floor, to avoid becoming a destination site for gawkers fascinated by its macabre history, some experts have suggested.
Officials facing similar decisions at the schools, churches and other places where mass shootings have taken place in recent years have gone in a variety of directions.
Some of the venues have been dismantled completely. Others, like the San Bernardino, California community center where a husband and wife killed 14 people in December 2015, have reopened, with officials saying that getting back to work helping people was integral to healing.
The Orlando, Florida nightclub where a gunman killed 49 people in June 2016, remains closed, and the owner plans to turn it into a memorial.
Connecticut’s Sandy Hook Elementary School, where 20 children and six adults were killed in 2012, was demolished and rebuilt four years later.
A spokesman for Mandalay Bay declined to comment on its plans.
But it appeared highly unlikely the suite would simply reopen as if nothing had happened there on Oct. 1.
“I wouldn’t want to stay in that room,” said North Carolina tourist Randy Dockery, at a makeshift memorial for the victims in a narrow patch of grass along the Las Vegas Strip.
Some experts suggested Mandalay Bay should erect a memorial somewhere in the hotel, either permanent or temporary, and throw a fundraiser for the victims and their families.
“The hotel was absolutely a victim as well, and by transforming some space into something that honors the victims, they could hopefully promote healing and actually some good,” said Kim Miller, president of Florida-based Ink Link Marketing, whose work includes advising companies on crisis management.
For Dockery, the choice was obvious.
“The memorial should be over there,” he said, pointing at the hotel. “But probably they don’t want the publicity.”",fake
3587,Brandon Saad is the spark the Chicago Blackhawks need,"Brandon Saad is the spark the Chicago Blackhawks need
(Before It's News)
After two long years with the Columbus Blue Jackets and John Tortorella, Brandon Saad is back at home with the Chicago Blackhawks. While Artemi Panarin had great chemistry with Patrick Kane, Saad is arguably more valuable to the Blackhawks. When Saad was traded away, Blackhawks fans and other hockey circles were quick to point out that he wouldn’t be as good with Columbus because he spent most of his time with Toews and Hossa on the first line. Saad answered his critics with two straight 53 point seasons, even surviving Tortorella’s nonsensical coaching methods. Tortorella would bench Saad or relegate him to the fourth line at times, Quenneville’s dog house isn’t even that bad! Saad is the complete hockey player package; skates hard and fast, defensively reliable, finishing scoring touch and hard to knock off the puck. With those tools, The Blackhawks needed to have Saad back in the fold to reignite Toews and anchor down the first line. With Hossa out of the lineup this year Saad is one of the few players that can fill that gap. I’m totally aware that Hossa can’t just be “replaced” Saad can still provide that same stability and presence. The Saad – Toews – Panik line can be a force to be reckoned with this season. Brandon Saad on Marian Hossa’s Influence:
” That guy [Hossa] means a lot to a lot of people. For me to come in as a young guy especially, he’s a guy I’ve looked up to. I think he plays the game the way I want to play the game.”
Stan Bowman ultimately brought Saad back because he’s cost controlled at $6 million a year over 4 years and only 24 years old. There was absolutely no way the Blackhawks could afford Panarin’s contract after 2 years when his asking price will likely be over $7 million. If the past two years and this year’s preseason is any indication, Saad is ready to have the best season of his career back at home with the Blackhawks and once again fans can KNEEL BEFORE SAAD.

711,Hollywood mostly silent on Weinstein allegations,"(CNN) More than a day after The New York Times published a blistering report detailing numerous accusations of sexual harassment against prolific film producer Harvey Weinstein, none of the movie mogul's frequent A-list collaborators have spoken publicly about the news story that has rattled Hollywood.
CNN reached out to representatives for a dozen actors and directors who have worked on Weinstein-produced films. All failed to respond or declined to comment.
On social media, Jessica Chastain, Judd Apatow, Lena Dunham, Brie Larson, and Amber Tamblyn are a few of the artists and filmmakers who posted messages of support to Weinstein's accusers or commented on the Times report.
""As always, I stand with the brave survivors of sexual assault and harassment. It's not your fault. I believe you,"" Larson wrote.
Chastain, considered an awards season contender for her work in Aaron Sorkin's ""Molly's Game,"" said: ""Women are fighting against the 'Grab Them By The Pussy' normalization & speaking up. It's never easy to be the first to go on record #Respect""
On Thursday, The Times published a story chronicling nearly three decades of alleged sexual misconduct by Weinstein, and claiming that Weinstein had come to legal settlements with at least eight female accusers over the years.
Weinstein has said he will sue over the publication's handling of the story, which featured interviews with accusers including actress Ashley Judd.
Charles Harder, Weinstein's attorney claimed that Weinstein's camp provided information that the Times failed to include, but he did not identify specific inaccuracies in the report.
Tamblyn, who appeared in The Weinstein Company's 2012 film ""Django Unchained,"" offered her thoughts on those who came forward in the article.
""Heed the mantra and never forget: Women. Have. Nothing. To. Gain. And. Everything. To Lose. By. Coming. forward,"" she tweeted.
Apatow, a producer on awards hopeful ""The Big Sick,"" took aim at Weinstein's statement on the accusations, released yesterday.
In Weinstein's statement, he claimed he ""came of age in the 60's and 70's, when all the rules about behavior and workplaces were different.""
""That was the culture then,"" he said. ""I have since learned it's not an excuse, in the office - or out of it.""
Apatow tweeted: ""The 70's were 37 years ago. You are blaming growing up in the 70's? You haven't picked up anything since then?""
Weinstein also expressed remorse and announced he would be taking a leave of absence from The Weinstein Company to seek treatment.
""I appreciate the way I've behaved with colleagues in the past has caused a lot of pain, and I sincerely apologize for it,"" Weinstein said.
Late Friday, The Weinstein Company announced his leave would be indefinite and begin immediately.
Hollywood's need for a 'culture change'
How long the silence from Weinstein's closest allies will last remains to be seen.
Kirsten Schaffer, executive director of Women In Film, a nonprofit that promotes gender parity in Hollywood, said she believes the lack of response won't last.
""I'm hopeful it's going to come,"" she said, when asked about the radio silence from Weinstein's deep well of famous heavy-hitters. ""If it doesn't come, we still live in a culture of fear. People are legitimately afraid of speaking out and that it will affect their careers because it has affected people's careers in the past.""
Schaffer said there is a need for a ""culture change in Hollywood"" -- one that would empower people to speak out about their own experiences and support victims.
""I think for the culture to change, it takes leaders -- leaders of studios, networks, production companies, agencies, to change the value system,"" she said. ""They need to put as much weight on doing the right thing as they put on making money. I really believe those two can co-exist.""
In the short term, The Weinstein Company, which Weinstein co-founded with his brother Bob in 2005, may have some more immediate concerns.
Attention paid to the accusations against Weinstein could overshadow the release of ""The Current War,"" a drama starring Benedict Cumberbatch as Thomas Edison and Michael Shannon as George Westinghouse. The November 24 release was considered one of The Weinstein Company's awards contenders.
The production company also has ""Paddington 2"" out on January 12 and ""The Upside"" with Bryan Cranston and Kevin Hart out March 9, and ""Mary Magdalene"" starring Rooney Mara out March 30.
The long-term affects of the accusations against Weinstein are harder to pin point. Will Hollywood actresses will turn their back on The Weinstein Co.? Will actors?
Schaffer would like to hear from both and believes actors need to stand side-by-side on the issue.
""I would love to see more actors leaning in...and speaking out about it. I think that's definitely part of the solution,"" she said. ""Male allies are critical. We can't do this without them. We need more brave men to step up and speak out.""",fake

1487,OL Grades & Notes vs. Steelers,"OL Grades & Notes vs. Steelers
% of readers think this story is Fact. Add your two cents.
(Before It's News)
Due to travel, I’ll only have time for OL scoring this week. I encourage you to listen to the OL podcast at the bottom of this article (or here) for a broader discussion about the offense.
Offensive Line Scoring
The Ravens ran 66 scored snaps versus the Steelers (excludes accepted penalties which result in no play, kneels, spikes, and special teams plays that result in a run or pass).
Stanley: Ronnie scored better despite giving some ground in the pocket. Ronnie was backed up in a manner similar to what we have seen in past years from Rick Wagner, but much of that was directed at the “back pylon” of the pocket where Flacco’s ability to step into a throw was not impeded, despite proximity. He surrendered 3 pressures (2 Heyward, 1 Watt), all of which came on bull rushes. He had 1 block in level 2, 1 pancake, and did not register a highlight. The Ravens didn’t run much in this game, but I am concerned he may not be right physically to provide the good leads in level 2 we’ve seen on fast developing plays in the past.
Scoring: 66 plays, 60 blocks, 3 missed, 3 pressures, 54 points (.82 per play). That’s a B with or without adjustment.
Hurst: James reversed a downward trend of games with his best outing of the season. He allowed 2 run penetrations, 1 on a level-2 whiff on Shazier (Q1, 14:15) and another on a whiffed pull on Tuitt (Q1, 12:13), but recovered to play well thereafter. He made 2 blocks in level 2, but did not have a pancake or highlight (more common on run plays).
Scoring: 66 plays, 57 blocks, 5 missed, 2 penetrations, 1 pressure, 51 points (.77 per play). After adjustment, that’s a B at guard.
Jensen: Ryan took a step back from his career-best game against the Jags. He was beaten right by Heyward for half a sack charge (Q2, 11:20) shared with Allen and Eluemunor. Dupree beat him on a stunt for pressure (Q2, 0:22) and Hargrave beat him left for a pressure (Q3, 6:12). He had 3 blocks in level 2, 1 pancake, and no highlights.
Scoring: 66 plays, 58 blocks, 2 missed, 1/3 penetration, 2.5 pressures, ½ sack, 49.33 points (.75 per play). After adjustment, that’s a C at center.
Skura/Eluemunor: Matt Skura mas not nearly as effective in his second start. Eluemunor was party to 4 negative events in just 16 snaps. It appears the staff would like to get Jermaine some live fire, because he’ll be starting if there is another injury at any of the 5 OL positions by either direct substitution or shuffling. Skura’s biggest individual event was being bulled by Heyward for 2/3 of a sack charge (Q3, 3:20). He also surrendered full pressures to both Heyward and Tuitt. On the plus side, he made 3 blocks in level 2, converted both pulling assignments, and had 2 highlights, including a very nice pancake of Shazier on a pull in level 2 (Q2, 7:19).
Scoring for Skura: 50 plays, 43 blocks, 2 missed, 1 penetration, 2.5 pressures, 2/3 sack, 32 points (.64 per play). With adjustment, that’s a D at guard.
Scoring for Eluemunor: 16 plays, 10 blocks, 2 missed, 1/3 penetration, 1 pressure, ½ (1/3 + 1/6) sack, 4.33 points (.27 per play). That’s too few snaps for a grade (20 is the minimum).
Scoring–Combined: 66 plays, 53 blocks, 4 missed, 1.33 penetrations, 2.5 pressures, 1.17 sacks, 36.33 points (.55 per play). That’s an F with or without adjustment.
Howard: Austin did a decent job vs Dupree, but Shazier was too quick for him, Tuitt overpowered him, Watt beat him once, and Heyward beat him for part of a penetration. Tuitt beat him for portions of 2 sacks on the same drive (Q3, 3:20 and Q4, 14:55). As is often the case, slow feet increase the chances for holds and he was guilty of an infraction against Shazier on the game’s final drive (Q4, 0:42).
Scoring: 66 plays, 55 blocks, 4 missed, 1.33 penetrations, 1 pressure, 1 (1/3 + 2/3) sack, 1 offensive holding, 38.33 points (.58 per play). That’s another D- after adjustment. I reduced his adjustment to .02, because he could have done more to bump Hilton further past the pocket and give Flacco a little more time on the DB’s sack. To be clear, Howard got no portion of a sack charge on that play, because Flacco had 3.5 seconds to throw.
If you’re interested in seeing scoring trends for the players this season, these charts will be updated weekly.

3953,Bob Corker just told the world what he really thinks of Donald Trump,"(CNN) Tennessee Republican Sen. Bob Corker suggested Wednesday that Gens. John Kelly and James Mattis, as well as Secretary of State Rex Tillerson are the ""people that help separate our country from chaos,"" a stinging criticism of President Donald Trump from a man once considered an ally in Washington.
Asked directly by a reporter whether he was referring to Trump in using the word ""chaos,"" Corker, who announced last month he would retire in 2018 , responded: ""(Mattis, Kelly and Tillerson) work very well together to make sure the policies we put forth around the world are sound and coherent. There are other people within the administration that don't. I hope they stay because they're valuable to the national security of our nation.""
Stop for a second and re-read that last paragraph. The sitting Republican chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee is suggesting that if Tillerson was removed from office (or quit), the national security of the country would potentially be in danger. And he's refusing to knock down -- and thereby affirming -- the idea that Trump is an agent of chaos who pushes policies that are not always ""sound"" or ""coherent.""
That. Is. Stunning.
Corker also blasted Trump for undermining Tillerson -- most recently with a weekend tweet suggesting that the secretary of state's diplomatic work to solve the North Korea crisis would fail.
""I told Rex Tillerson, our wonderful Secretary of State, that he is wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man,"" Trump tweeted Sunday morning
Corker said that Tillerson is ""in an incredibly frustrating place,"" adding: ""He ends up not being supported in the way I would hope a secretary of state would be supported. ... He's in a very trying situation -- trying to solve many of the world's problems without the support and help I'd like to see him have.""
This is also not the first time that Corker, who was once mentioned as a possible vice presidential pick and was on the short list for secretary of state, has been overtly and harshly critical of Trump. Corker drew national headlines in August when he suggested that Trump ""has not yet been able to demonstrate the stability nor some of the competence that he needs to demonstrate in order to be successful.""
Trump responded back via Twitter : ""Strange statement by Bob Corker considering that he is constantly asking me whether or not he should run again in '18. Tennessee not happy!""
Corker's comments Wednesday are rightly read as a continuation of his August remarks. Then, he openly questioned Trump's stability and competence. Now he is making clear that if not for Tillerson, Mattis and Kelly, Trump would be leading the nation -- and the world -- into chaos.
There's no question that Corker feels freer to speak his mind without the worry of angering the President and potentially stirring up a serious primary challenge. But what's even more important/scary to contemplate: If this is Corker saying what he really thinks about Trump, what must the rest of Republicans in the Senate and House think of their President? And when will they speak out?",fake

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Jason Aldean, who was performing on stage when a gunman fired down on a Las Vegas concert killing 58 people, made a surprise appearance on “Saturday Night Live,” paying tribute to the victims of the worst-ever U.S. mass shooting with a song by the late Tom Petty.
“Like everyone, I‘m struggling to understand what happened that night, and how to pick up the pieces and start to heal,” Aldean said as he opened the late-night comedy sketch show.
“So many people are hurting,” Aldean said in his first public performance since the shootings nearly a week ago at the Route 91 Harvest country music festival.
“They’re all part of our family. So I want to say to them, we hurt for you, and we hurt with you,” he said before performing Petty’s “I Won’t Back Down.” The 66-year-old rock star died on Monday, the day after the Las Vegas shootings in which some 500 people were injured.
Earlier this week Aldean canceled three shows to honor the victims of the shooting. The “They Don’t Know Tour” will resume in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on Oct. 12.

2638,Rising Up Against The Oligarchs Does Not Equal Socialism,"By Jon Rappoport
There are “people’s” groups all over the world who advocate the overthrow of the men at the top —the Oligarchs—who control nations.
These people’s groups want to install socialism as the answer to Oligarchy.
That’s preposterous.
The Oligarchs—bankers, mega-corporate CEOs, financiers, government leaders, intelligence agencies—collude to cut out competition so they can stand alone at the summit of the mountain. And they call this arrangement SOCIALISM. They PROMOTE socialism. They’ve staked out OWNERSHIP of socialism worldwide.
In other words, the “people’s” groups, who claim to be battling for a better world, are doing the Oligarchs’ bidding. Unconsciously, or on purpose.
Useful idiots.
Socialism has never been about toppling power-hungry leaders. Its pretension of equality and share-and-care is a cover for totalitarianism by the few, for the few.
Karl Marx, while predicting a coming utopia on Earth, expressed the absolute need for a “transition” phase called the “dictatorship of the proletariat.”
Of course, that was a partial misnomer. The “dictatorship” part was correct, but the proletariat would never run it. They would labor for it. They would look up from ground level at the leaders who were supposedly their friends and guardians—and soon realize they’d been taken in by a long con. There was no transition government. There was just the same old Oligarchy under another name, that’s all.
From Gary Allen’s 1971 classic, None Dare Call It Conspiracy:
“We are being socialized in America and everybody knows it. If we had a chance to sit down and have a cup of coffee with the man in the street…he might say: ‘You know, the one thing I can never figure out is why all these very, very wealthy people like the Kennedys, the Fords, the Rockefellers and others are for socialism. Why are the super-rich for socialism? Don’t they have the most to lose…?’ In reality, there is a vast difference between what the promoters define as socialism and what it is in actual practice. The idea that socialism is a share-the-wealth program is strictly a confidence game to get the people to surrender their freedom to an all-powerful collectivist government. While the insiders [Oligarchs] tell us we are building a paradise on earth, we are actually constructing a jail for ourselves.”
When a mega-corporate CEO, whose company is in deep financial trouble, magically secures a giant loan through a crony, and when that corporation continues to pollute the land and destroy lives, and while the government agency that should be hauling off the CEO to prison sits on its hands, that’s socialism in practice. That’s the real thing.
The government may not officially own such corporations, as in the classical definition of socialism, but at the top, the government and the biggest corporations are cooperating, as one. It’s a distinction without a difference.
Why don’t more people understand all this?
Because their minds are clouded with propaganda and feel-good New Age oatmeal. Because they’re convinced that believing in something that sounds good on the surface (“a better and more just world for all”) is enough, is a pinnacle of achievement for them. And since they’re told this belief is socialism, they’re for it.
They will fall for any program on that basis. If pernicious medical experts assure them that mandated mass vaccination will protect the planet from disease, they will snap up that vision in a minute. “A healthy Earth for everyone.” It must be true. It feels right.
Recently, I published an astonishing statement made by the Mayor of New York, Bill de Blasio: “What’s been hardest is the way our legal system is structured to favor private property. I think people all over this city, of every background, would like to have the city government be able to determine which building goes where, how high it will be, who gets to live in it, what the rent will be. I think there’s a socialistic impulse, which I hear every day, in every kind of community, that they would like things to be planned in accordance to their needs. And I would, too…Look, if I had my druthers, the city government would determine every single plot of land, how development would proceed. And there would be very stringent requirements around income levels and rents. That’s a world I’d love to see, and I think what we have, in this city at least, are people who would love to have the New Deal back, on one level. They’d love to have a very, very powerful government, including a federal government, involved in directly addressing their day-to-day reality.”
The control of private property, from above, is of course one of the tenets of socialism.
Oligarchs, who promote their brand of socialism, who are also Globalists (no nations, no borders), want to sweeten their pot through floods of immigrants. No, they’re not thinking about “doing good.” They have propaganda operatives who spout that line.
They’re thinking about how they can blur and erase all sorts of distinctions surrounding private ownership of private property—and instead, disruptively resettle immigrants, make them dependent on the State, sink property values, and induce more and more citizens to accept the idea that “everything belongs to everybody.”
This gibberish phrase actually means: the Oligarchs own it all.
This is their premise and their goal.
They mean business, literally and figuratively.
On a much lower level, scratch the surface of any self-proclaimed socialist who happens own a home, and watch what happens when you demand he turn that home over to “the people.” He suddenly becomes a raw naked capitalist. He rails against the State.
The State—to whom, when the pressure is off, he claims every citizen should swear allegiance, so that money and property and services and goods and energy and every necessity and luxury of life can be managed, for the benefit of all.

This is the week when you have to start really making some choices. With the first four teams on scheduled byes, roster management will start coming into play. Carrying two defenses might be a luxury you can no longer afford, but that doesn’t mean we should stop streaming if it makes sense to do so. Let’s take a look at how the defenses rank for this week:
Minnesota Vikings – at Chicago Philadelphia Eagles – vs. Arizona Detroit Lions – vs. Carolina Pittsburgh Steelers – vs. Jacksonville Kansas City Chiefs – at Houston Buffalo Bills – at Cincinnati New York Jets – at Cleveland Jacksonville Jaguars – at Pittsburgh Baltimore Ravens – at Oakland San Francisco 49ers – at Indianapolis Oakland Raiders – at Baltimore Tennessee Titans – at Miami New York Giants – vs. LA Chargers Carolina Panthers – at Detroit Seattle Seahawks – at LA Rams
Notes:
Instead of targeting the Jets for your defense, it might be time to take a look at New York’s defense. A week after holding the Dolphins to a lone, last second touchdown, the Jets limited Jacksonville to 14 points last week. New York has two rookie safeties in Jamal Adams and Marcus Maye who have bolstered the secondary, and as a whole, they have looked sharper than they did the first two weeks of the season. Through four games the Jets haven’t generated much production, six sacks and four interceptions, but 20 points in the last two games is solid. It also doesn’t hurt that this week the Jets face the Browns who have allowed opposing defenses to rack up the second most points this season.
There is nothing better than taking advantage of a rookie quarterback making his first career start. It’s not like they generally take over in good situations, but it also helps that Chicago hasn’t had much success moving the ball. Conditions aren’t going to be ideal for Mitch Trubisky and, on paper, Minnesota has a strong defense. The results haven’t been there so far, but it’s really the lack of turnovers holding the Vikings back. They have given solid performances through four weeks, but they have three interceptions which all came against Jameis Winston. The Vikings will likely make things hard for the rookie as they have picked up 11 sacks so far this season.
Through the first four weeks of the season Detroit has the number one ranked fantasy defense. Other than last week against the Patriots, who haven’t shown much of a defense to speak of this season, Carolina has struggled to move the ball and generate points. Having Darius Slay to shut down the opposition’s number one receiver is a plus as the Lions have come up with seven interceptions and 10 sacks in four games while also scoring three touchdowns of their own. Despite his success last week, I have a hard time trusting Cam Newton and that means good things for Detroit.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - The Indian government is considering exemptions sought by Apple Inc for setting up a unit to assemble iPhones, Ramesh Abhishek, the top bureaucrat in the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion, said on Thursday.
The department is a part of India’s commerce and industry ministry.
Apple has asked federal government officials for a range of tax and policy changes to help build out its iPhone assembly work in India.
It is seeking permission to open its own retail stores in India where it currently sells iPhones through resellers.
India has given Chinese smartphone maker Oppo the go-ahead to open its own single-brand retail stores, boding well for rivals like Apple, which are seeking similar approvals.

2844,Your Ancestors Didn’t Sleep Like You,"Long before eighteen snoozes of alarm clocks and memory foam mattresses, there was a time when physicians did not recommend an eight-hour night of sleep.
 
Instead, people of the time had two periods of sleep. There is a lot of speculation about the true origin of two periods of sleep and if it is historical in nature.
 
At the turn of the century, a historian named Roger Ekirch from Virginia Tech published in American Historical Review that human sleep pattern in the pre-industrial age was biphasic.
 
What, if any, could be the biological advantage of waking yourself up after a couple of hours, staying awake long enough for three Netflix shows (the 45-minute ones), and then falling back asleep until morning?
 
It has been reported that there is a reproductive advantage to having two periods of sleep. Supposedly, there exists a recommendation from a physician that couples try to conceive in between periods of sleep because it is more enjoyable.
 
A nap, some coitus, then sleeping for the night does sound like an enjoyable way to live. Perhaps as well, the loss of first sleep and lengthening of second sleep, may be related to the steep decline in the US birth rate.
 
It was reported in the Washington Post this past June that “the US fertility rate [is at] a historic low.” If a doctor did prescribe copulation between periods of sleep as the BBC reported, and humans have lost two periods of sleep, it is reasonable that simply reinstating a biphasic sleep pattern will help raise the dwindling childbirth numbers.
 
As a final note, when the government or corporations more likely took away two periods of sleep, they also likely took away the existence of two dreams. While scientists are still uncovering the biological function and advantage of dreaming, it is easy to speculate how having multiple dreams can lead to a higher quality of life.

Since Mike Hart’s infamous “little brother” quote in 2007, Michigan State is 8-2 against Michigan.
—————–
We knew this season might be difficult. While the defense has adjusted to all of the new starters, the offense has not. At all. The O-line has serious issues, the receivers aren’t quite there yet, running backs are wildly inconstant (thanks mainly to the OL) and the QB spot has been…a little iffy to put it kindly. Maybe things will get better this year? A loss can something force a young team to refocus and come together.
It’s on the coaches to figure this out. Now, we’re going to find out if the $9 million dollars per year Michigan is paying Jim Harbaugh is worth it or not.
—————–
Michigan State didn’t win this game. Michigan handed it to them. Over and over again.
It’s easy to assign blame. I mean, that’s essentially all you can do after a frustrating loss like this…and there’s plenty of blame to go around. The things we saw last night in Michigan’s 14-10 loss to Michigan State followed an all-too-familiar script that, realistically, we should’ve seen coming. But we wanted to believe that just maybe, with John O’Korn now at quarterback, this Michigan offense would find new life. Wilton Speight clearly had his issues earlier in the year…and frustratingly, now so does O’Korn.
It’s entirely possible it’s not the quarterback that’s the problem here. The offensive line, mainly the right side, struggled throughout the game. Sophomore right tackle Nolan Ulizio was replaced early by Juwann Bushell-Beatty, but with no real tangible effect. Both struggled equally. O’Korn was on the run almost all night and backs had very few holes to run through.
Five turnovers, including three in the second half, stifled any momentum Michigan hoped to have offensively. Points off turnovers has been a familiar trend for Michigan opponents early in games this year, and this game was no different. Ty Issac’s fumble on Michigan second drive gave MSU a short field, resulting in 7 early points for the Spartans.
I swear each week a different running back fumbles the ball early in the game giving opponents life they didn’t deserve…completely flipping the momentum.
Michigan seemed completely lost on offense after Michigan State’s first touchdown. The playcalling has been a head-scratcher for this blogger all season and against last night. One short drive is all runs…another short drive is all passes. And in a driving monsoon, coaches are asking O’Korn to throw 15-25 yards downfield. In the post-game presser, Harbaugh said “we’re just trying piece drives together.” From my point of view, there’s no consistency, scheme or gameplan whatsoever with the playcalling.
O’Korn said afterward, “You’ve got to execute the plays that are called regardless of the conditions”. Which is fine if you’re an offense that has been consistently moving the ball and has a nice lead…but when you can’t move the ball, you’re down by a score, it’s pouring down rain and you’re being asked to throw downfield to young receivers while you’re running for your life because of poor pass protection…that statement from O’Korn speaks volumes about his frustration with the plays being called.
If it’s bad enough for even me to realize…then it has to be bad.
Defensively, this performance was everything you could ask for. Hats off to them for keeping this a 4 point game for as long as they did. After the 8:07 in the second quarter, Michigan State never scored again. After going up 14-3, Michigan State only had 3 first downs for the rest of the game. In the second half, Michigan State had 6 three-and-outs, and 1 turnover on downs.
The Spartans couldn’t do anything offensively against Michigan…but they didn’t really have to. Michigan killed themselves. You can’t ask for a better defensive performance than what Don Brown served up last night. It’s just a shame Michigan had zero offense to be able to compliment it.
Its been said by many already and will be echoed all week long…you simply can’t turn the ball over 5 times and expect to win. Simple as that.
For Jim Harbaugh, this makes him 1-4 against Michigan two biggest rivals, Michigan State and Ohio State. Obviously not the kind of mark we thought we’d see out of him by his 3rd year at Michigan. This season is far from over, but Michigan has to regroup quickly and find some way to move the ball and score some points because the schedule doesn’t get any easier from here on in.

3669,New Museum Selects Rem Koolhaas for Expansion on the Bowery,"Photo
The New Museum may have a relatively modest budget for its expansion — $85 million — but the institution has selected a big-name architect to design it: Rem Koolhaas.
The museum is to announce on Wednesday that Mr. Koolhaas and Shohei Shigematsu of OMA will design a new building on the adjacent property at 231 Bowery, which the institution purchased in 2008. This would be the first public project in New York City for OMA, the firm founded by Mr. Koolhaas.
“I’ve admired Rem’s work and the firm for a long time — he’s a top thinker, he’s an urbanist, he’s got his finger on the pulse of the city and has thought about New York more than many people,” Lisa Phillips, the museum’s director, said in a telephone interview. “He’s also a futurist; he thinks very much about the new.”
The structure, which will connect to the museum’s Sanaa-designed building, will double the museum’s footprint on the Bowery, providing an additional 50,000 square feet for galleries, improved public circulation, and flexible space for the institution’s more experimental programs like its business incubator and the urban-policy think tank that it runs.
The OMA addition is meant to honor the museum’s original building, Ms. Phillips said, but to have its own identity and extend the institution’s campus. “We have this iconic image that telegraphs the mission of the museum so beautifully,” she said, referring to the Sanaa building. “That’s not something we’re going to be looking to repeat.”
Ms. Phillips said the museum has raised more than 50 percent of the cost, which includes endowment funds, and that the project is to break ground in 2019.",fake
106,"Fed Still Puzzled by Inflation, but Rate Increase Is on Track","The Fed also indicated that it planned to raise its benchmark rate once more this year, following quarter-point increases in March and June. In economic projections released after the meeting, 12 of the 16 officials on the Federal Open Market Committee predicted a third rate hike. Janet L. Yellen, the Fed’s chairwoman, reinforced that expectation in a speech in Cleveland a week later.
Ms. Yellen reviewed the reasons to worry about low inflation but concluded that the weight of evidence did not warrant a shift in the Fed’s plans. “Given that monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation with a substantial lag, it would be imprudent to keep monetary policy on hold until inflation is back to 2 percent,” she said.
But the minutes of the September meeting said that “a few” Fed officials opposed another 2017 rate move, and that “several others” remained on the fence.
Charles Evans, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, is among the skeptics. “There’s room for a very honest discussion later this year as to whether or not it’s the right time to raise rates,” Mr. Evans told Bloomberg News on Wednesday.
The divisions are not about the economic outlook. The account noted that all participants agreed that economic activity during the summer months was in line with the Fed’s expectations “and that the incoming data had not materially altered the medium-term economic outlook.”
The Fed expects the recent hurricanes to bring down the figures for third-quarter growth, but it anticipates a rebound in the fourth quarter and little impact from the storms going forward.

The issue is the behavior of inflation. The Fed aims to keep inflation at an annual pace of about 2 percent, but it has undershot that goal consistently since the financial crisis, and the Fed says it expects to miss the target again this year.
A majority of Fed officials, led by Ms. Yellen, continue to subscribe to the view that inflation is just around the corner.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
“Many participants continued to believe that the cyclical pressures associated with a tightening labor market or an economy operating above its potential were likely to show through to higher inflation over the medium term,” the account said.
Those officials want to raise interest rates so long as the economy keeps growing.
“The Fed’s models tell them that an economy at full employment eventually produces more inflation down the road and they want the Fed funds rate to be back to normal levels before that happens,” said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group.
Some also want to raise rates because they are concerned that markets are not responding to the Fed’s pressure. The Fed raises its benchmark rate to tighten financial conditions, including borrowing costs, but conditions have eased so far this year.
The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury has fallen almost 5 percent this year; the decline was even deeper before it began to bounce back last month.
William C. Dudley, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, has highlighted the market’s equanimity as a reason to keep raising interest rates, noting in a speech this month that financial conditions have eased since last December even as the Fed has raised its benchmark rate by three-quarters of a percentage point, a substantial increase.
The dissidents are less unified in their critiques. Some argue that employment has room to grow. The share of prime-age adults with jobs remains below the level before the recession. The account also pointed to the “absence of broad-based upward wage pressures.”
Some officials also see evidence that other factors may be weighing on inflation. The account noted that inflation is low in other advanced economies, and there has been some erosion in market expectations of future inflation, which can become a self-fulfilling prophecy.
Those worries have occupied a larger portion of the official minutes with each passing meeting this year, reflecting the growing puzzlement and concern among officials. “Many participants expressed concern that the low inflation readings this year might reflect not only transitory factors but also the influence of developments that could prove more persistent,” it said.",fake
169,Brazilian activist awarded for fight against Amazon rainforest dam,"RIO DE JANEIRO (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - A Brazilian activist on Tuesday won a top international honor for her long fight against a giant hydroelectric dam in the Amazon rainforest that has forced tens of thousands of indigenous people from their homes.
Antonia Melo is the first Brazilian to receive the Alexander Soros Foundation Award for Environmental and Human Rights Activism, designed to expose the impacts of projects such as the Belo Monte dam on the Xingu river.
The project, which will be one of the world‘s largest hydroelectric dams, will flood a swathe of biodiverse rainforest inhabited by the indigenous Xinguense people.
“This award will strengthen and shed light on our fight against this dam,” Melo told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
Melo, 64, has been campaigning against the dam for more than two decades. Born in Brazil’s Northeast region, she moved to the Amazon region where the dam is being built when she was 4 years old.
“I consider myself a Xinguense,” she said.
Belo Monte is the largest and most high-profile of an estimated 100 hydropower projects planned for the Brazilian Amazon.
Some 40,000 people from small, riverside communities have already been forced from their homes by the project, twice as many as were projected before construction began in 2011, Melo said.
“Evictions are a very violent process that will remain in our hearts forever,” she said.
A federal court in September suspended again the operating license for the dam, saying Norte Energia, the consortium running the project, did not comply with commitments made when it won the bid.
A Brasilia-based court ordered further construction halted until the consortium meets commitments to provide adequate housing for those driven from their homes.
Norte Energia has denied that it has failed to provide adequate housing and said it is complying with all commitments made when it won the tender.
Alexander Soros, founder of the Alexander Soros Foundation, said the award aims to shed light on the potentially damaging impact of megaprojects that could be more “environmentally catastrophic” than are logging and mining operations.
Environmental and land rights problems have worsened in Brazil amid political turmoil, corruption scandals and the country’s worst recession in decades, Soros said.",fake
1682,Trump Threatens N.F.L. and Attacks Jemele Hill of ESPN,"Mr. Trump on Tuesday also focused his fire again on Jemele Hill, the “SportsCenter” host on ESPN who previously called the president a white supremacist. Ms. Hill was suspended on Monday for suggesting that fans boycott advertisers of the Dallas Cowboys after the team owner, Jerry Jones, threatened to bench players who knelt during the national anthem.
“With Jemele Hill at the mike, it is no wonder ESPN ratings have ‘tanked,’ in fact, tanked so badly it is the talk of the industry!” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter.
ESPN has faced significant challenges recently and is now available in just under 88 million homes, compared with 100 million homes in 2011. In the first half of 2017, its prime-time ratings were up 1 percent compared with the same period in 2016, although its total day ratings were down more than 5 percent. But ESPN is still a ratings behemoth and still highly profitable. In the third quarter, it led full-time cable networks in total day and prime-time ratings among the key demographics of men ages 18 to 54.
The president continues to be animated by his fight with the sports world. He has enthusiastically kept up his attacks on the N.F.L., with which he has a long history of antagonism. A onetime owner of the New Jersey Generals in the upstart United States Football League, Mr. Trump persuaded other owners to sue the N.F.L. using antitrust law. The U.S.F.L. won the case, but the jury awarded only $1 in damages — tripled to $3 by law — and Mr. Trump’s league ultimately folded.
The N.F.L.’s tax exemption has long been controversial. The league’s 32 teams are for-profit businesses that pay taxes accordingly, but the central office became a nonprofit organization decades ago. In response to the criticism, the league in 2015 voluntarily gave up its tax-exempt status because of what it called the “distraction.”
It is not clear that it cost the league much money. While the league as a whole generates billions of dollars in revenue a year, the league office ran a deficit of $13.5 million in the fiscal year that ended a year before the decision to give up the tax-exempt status. But the change meant the league no longer had to disclose what it paid its commissioner, Roger Goodell.

Last month, after the kneeling controversy erupted, a Republican congressman, Representative Matt Gaetz of Florida, introduced legislation stripping professional sports leagues of tax-exempt status, an idea that has been debated on Capitol Hill for years.
In a conference call with reporters on Tuesday, Joe Lockhart, the N.F.L. spokesman, said the league receives no “massive” tax breaks, as Mr. Trump contended.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Regarding the player protests, Mr. Lockhart said the league’s 260-page game operations manual has not changed and he highlighted the precise language governing the anthem. The players, he said, “must” be on the sidelines during the playing of the anthem and “should” stand for the anthem. The league, however, has “not chosen to discipline any of the players” who have not stood for the anthem, he said.
That might change next week, though, when the owners meet in New York, where the anthem protests will be on the agenda. Mr. Goodell and the owners want the players to stand “because we think it’s an important part of the game,” Mr. Lockhart said, and “there’s a strong feeling at every level that we ought to be getting back to football.”
Sports teams have benefited in other ways under tax law. Many franchises have built new stadiums in cooperation with cities and states that floated bonds to finance construction. Municipal bonds are exempt from federal taxes, leading critics to complain that taxpayers are subsidizing profitable private businesses. Mr. Lockhart said local government subsidies hade been an “economic engine” for those communities.
A study by the Brookings Institution last year concluded that three dozen sports franchises from the N.F.L., Major League Baseball, National Basketball Association and National Hockey League had financed stadiums since 2000 using tax-exempt municipal bonds.
The biggest beneficiary was not a football franchise but the New York Yankees, the president’s hometown baseball team, which Brookings estimated saved $492 million as a result. Among the football owners who have benefited from such bonds was Mr. Trump’s friend Mr. Jones, whose Dallas Cowboys saved $88 million in building AT&T Stadium.
It was unclear how Congress might prohibit states, counties and cities from deciding how to spend their tax revenue, or whether it could undo deals that were approved years ago. It is also unclear whether it would be possible for legislators to target teams in one league, like the N.F.L., and not another, like Major League Baseball.
The federal government has limited room to act against the N.F.L. in other areas. The league has all but abandoned its policy of blacking out games in home markets when teams fail to sell out their stadiums, giving the Federal Communications Commission less oversight over professional football. The league, however, does have something akin to an antitrust exemption, thanks to a 1966 law, that allows every team to band together to negotiate television deals.
As part of his campaign against sports figures who have criticized him, the president on Tuesday hosted the N.H.L. champions at the White House.

1460,Exclusive: EU may shun Myanmar generals in new sanctions - draft,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union will cut back contacts with Myanmar’s top generals in a first step to increase sanctions over an army offensive that has driven more than 500,000 Rohingya Muslims out of the country, according to a draft document seen by Reuters.
Thousands of the Rohingya fled for Myanmar to Bangladesh on Monday in a new surge of refugees driven by fears of starvation and violence which the United Nations denounced as ethnic cleansing.
The United States and the European Union have been considering targeted sanctions against Myanmar military leaders, though the European bloc sees its options as relatively limited, with no hard-hitting, direct leverage on the ground.
EU foreign ministers will discuss the situation in Myanmar on Oct.16, and their draft joint statement said the bloc “will suspend invitations to the commander-in-chief of the Myanmar/Burma armed forces and other senior military officers”.
The text, which will be discussed further by envoys from the 28 EU states on Tuesday and may be modified, said the EU may consider further measures depending on developments in Myanmar but would “respond accordingly to positive developments”.
The document confirmed support for an existing EU embargo on arms and equipment “that can be used for internal repression”.
It called on Myanmar to discuss repatriating refugees from neighboring Bangladesh and praised the latter for its role in the crisis, which started when attacks by Rohingya militants on security posts brought a ferocious military response.

Refugees and rights groups say the army and Buddhist vigilantes use killing and arson to drive the Rohingya out of Myanmar. Myanmar rejects accusations of ethnic cleansing.
The EU draft characterized the situation in the most-affected Rakhine State as “extremely serious” and said Kachin and Shan provinces were also “of great concern.”
It called on all sides to cease violence, told the military to “end its operations” and protect all civilians equally, as well as calling on Myanmar to allow humanitarian access to the affected regions.
The West has invested politically in Myanmar leader and Nobel peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, who has faced scathing international criticism for not doing more to stop the violence.
While the EU feels disillusioned, it also acknowledges Aung San Suu Kyi has little influence over Myanmar’s security forces.
The move to punish the army head is largely symbolic as the West is also wary of hurting the wider economy or destabilizing already-tense ties between Suu Kyi and the army.
Its leverage on the ground fades compared to that of Myanmar’s immediate neighbors, including China.

I see Kyle Sinckler was last night found guilty of gouging by an RFU disciplinary panel and will now deservedly serve a 7 week ban (for which he can count himself lucky), ruling him out of England’s November internationals.
This, in addition to Sinckler’s arrest by New Zealand police in Auckland in July, suggests that the young Quins prop is beginning to establish something of a bad rep for himself, an issue he’s going to have to get to grips with fairly quickly if he expects to retain the support of Eddie Jones and, perhaps more importantly, avoid nomination for the Total Flanker Hall of Wazzocks.
Meanwhile, Wasps Ladies’ Liz Crake may have just struck a decisive blow for gender equality by being cited for allegedly biting Gloucester-Hartpury outside-half Ceri Large in Gloucester-Hartpury’s recent 26-22 win over Wasps. If found guilty she could face a ban of 12+ weeks.
I have yet to find how her disciplinary hearing went, but could the Hall of Wazzocks possibly have found its first female member?

Raiders Throw Game to Punish QB Who Wouldn’t Protest Trump – Where Is Roger Goodell Now?
After the NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell turned zealot and decided Patriots QB Tom Bradey must be punished for someone under-inflating a game ball by –1.5 lbs. of pressure, and for Tom Brady being unable to discern this from holding a frozen ball in the middle of January in the middle of the Super Bowl, he should be suspended on absolutely zero evidence, we will see where he stands on an entire offensive line throwing a game due to racial and political divides that NFL players have decided to drag the league. I personally will not watch another pro football game for the rest of my life. I am not kidding you.
Goodwell has now come out on the side of the players who protested Trump and threw a football game so as to draw attention away from this scandal by calling Trump devisive. Is there any doubt Goodwell is a moral coward? If hypocrisy is the respect that vice pays to virtue, Goodwell has now paid enough to bankrupt the entire NFL.
Below is the full story for which there is tons of ample direct and circumstantial evidence. Where is Goodwell now? Will he be too much of a coward to deal with the situation that threatens to destroy the NFL? There is much more evidence for this than there ever was for going after Tom Brady. Now everyone will act as if this criminal matter never took place because they simple don’t have the nerve to follow their own rules and standards when it really counts. It is so much easier to go after one white man than it is to go after an entire offensive line of African-Americans corrupting the game of football due to their political affiliations and protests against America. If Goodwell does nothing, Americans ought to protest en mass.

3646,Catalan crisis: Spanish court bars MPs' independence move,"Image copyright EPA Image caption Pro-independence demonstrations have continued, following Sunday's referendum
Spain's Constitutional Court has suspended next Monday's session of the Catalan parliament, in a bid to pre-empt a possible push for independence.
The court said such a move would be ""a breach of the constitution"".
Earlier Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy warned Catalonia's regional government against declaring independence after a disputed vote last Sunday.
Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont had indicated that he could make such a declaration at next week's session.
The court's ruling on Thursday upheld a challenge not from the government in Madrid, but by the Socialists' Party of Catalonia, which opposes secession from Spain.
Allowing the regional parliament to meet and declare independence, the court said, would violate the rights of the party's MPs.
An earlier ruling by the court aimed at stopping Sunday's vote was ignored by Catalonia's leaders. That challenge to the court had come from Spain's government, which condemned the referendum as illegal.
The socialists won almost 13% of the vote in the 2015 election, and has 13 MPs in the 135-seat regional parliament.

Organisers of Sunday's vote put the turnout at 42%, with 2.2 million people taking part. They say 90% voted for independence, however they have not published final results. There have been several claims of irregularities.
There was violence at polling stations as police, trying to enforce a Spanish court decision to ban the vote, attempted to seize ballot boxes and disperse voters.

Rajoy's gambit
Analysis by BBC Europe Editor Katya Adler, Madrid
Mariano Rajoy is famous for his ""wait-and-see"" attitude in crises. He's more of a technocrat than a passionate politician. So far, it's served him well. While not wildly popular, he remains very much in control of Spain's central government.
But the Catalan question is risky for him. His apparent inertia this week is coming under fire from the Spanish left - who want him to start a dialogue with Catalan separatists - and the harder right who want him to take immediate action, shutting the Catalan government down, bringing the reins of power back to Madrid. Spaniards call it ""the nuclear option"".
In a nod to them on Thursday, Mr Rajoy warned of ""greater damage"" if Catalan separatists went ahead with a unilateral declaration of independence. Spain's constitutional court has now banned Monday's meeting of the Catalan parliament where that declaration was expected to be made.
While this may appear a setback for the separatists, they have ignored court rulings before. But Mr Rajoy hopes the weight of Spanish law will now serve to divide Catalonia's pro-independence parties - which range from the moderate to the radical - and weaken their resolve.

Police chief Edson Garutti, told Globo News that brothers Joesley and Wesley Batista knew they had information that would impact the market and profited with trades with stocks and foreign currency before details of the plea deal and leniency agreement for the company were made public, on May 17.
The Batista brothers saved as much as 138 million reais ($44 million) by selling JBS stock before its 9.7 percent fall on the following day. JBS also bought dollar future contracts. The dollar rose 8.2 percent on the day after the details of the plea deal were made public.
In his plea bargain testimony, Joesley Batista accused President Michel Temer of endorsing bribes the company paid to politicians, setting off a crisis that led to corruption charges against the president.
The police report was handed to federal prosecutors, who will decide whether to file charges against the Batistas.
Federal prosecutors on Monday opened an investigation into whether the holding company J&F Investimentos SA, which manages the fortune of the Batista family, including a controlling stake in JBS SA, violated the terms of the leniency deal.
J&F Investimentos agreed in May to pay a record fine of 10.3 billion reais ($3.2 billion) for its involvement in corruption.

On Sunday I was in attendance when the Ravens took on the Jaguars at Wembley Stadium. There was a buzz in the air – the excitement of taking in a game on foreign soil and meeting Europeans from all over the continent who had a rooting interest in the game.
It was different than any game I’ve ever experienced and as I stood for the playing of our national anthem, with my hat proudly fixed atop my heart, I hung on every syllable sung beautifully by Noah Stewart. My eyes glistened with tears of joy, the byproduct of pride for my country and the many blessings bestowed upon me by so many others who enabled this unforgettable moment.
I stared at the colors of our flag as it hung from the rafters of Wembley.
And I smiled.
But the smile didn’t last long.
Shortly after the playing of the UK’s national anthem, “God Save The Queen”, I started receiving text messages from friends back in the States who were outraged by several Ravens taking a knee during the playing of the Star-Spangled Banner, something I failed to notice from my seat.
The mood changed dramatically, and the Ravens did nothing on the field to reverse the rapidly sinking feeling. All that seemed so magical just moments before was gone with a communal bend of the knee.
The protests were heard loud and clear. The game suddenly seemed unimportant. The division of a nation took precedent.
We can rationally debate the merits of the protest, but we seemingly prefer to argue irrationally.
The purpose of any protest is to call attention to something that an individual or group takes exception to. To this extent, the protests across the NFL were successful. But once the attention is achieved and issue at hand is defined and brought to the forefront, the goal should be to resolve differences – to see something through the eyes of an adversary in order to realize an acceptable compromise that benefits all parties.
Unfortunately, at least for the moment, the protests have exacerbated the issues and the divisiveness is more pronounced. Both sides are throwing fuel on the fire, lost in the cause instead of defining solutions.
This is a time when leaders on both sides need to lead. They need to step up for the greater good and seek solutions, together. Stubbornness or escalation of commitment won’t get us there. Isn’t that already obvious?
Football is a game we all love. It’s a pastime – an opportunity to forget about the things that trouble us for 3 hours on a Sunday. It is an opportunity to come together as one for something that we, as a community, have in common.
I remember when the Ravens won Super Bowl XXXV and the celebrations that followed in Baltimore. “Our” team won and we rejoiced like nobody’s business – TOGETHER! It was reported that during that celebratory night on January 28, 2001 that only one arrest was made in the city of Baltimore. ONE! A misdemeanor.
That’s what sports teams can do. They can galvanize a community. And those teams are enabled by the freedoms we enjoy as American citizens – freedoms symbolized by our flag.
We’ve overcome bigger issues in the past.
Let’s not let foolish pride stand in our way.
Together we can fix this.
We owe that to those who sacrificed so much for their country.
Our country…

(Reuters) - Cable sports network ESPN on Monday suspended broadcaster Jemele Hill for violating its social media guidelines for a second time in the past month after she tweeted on NFL player protests.
Hill on Sunday said football fans should boycott advertisers of the Dallas Cowboys if they were offended by team owner Jerry Jones’ threat to bench players who did not stand during the national anthem.
ESPN said in a statement it had suspended Hill for two weeks for the second violation. It said she “previously acknowledged letting her colleagues and company down with an impulsive tweet” last month in which she called U.S. President Donald Trump a “white supremacist” who has surrounded himself with other white supremacists.
Hill is one of the hosts of ESPN’s sports news program, SportsCenter. In a series of tweets on Sunday and Monday, she responded to Jones’ comments about not playing anyone who was disrespectful of the U.S. flag.
“Change happens when advertisers are impacted. If you feel strongly about JJ’s statement, boycott his advertisers,” Hill wrote on Twitter on Sunday.
On Monday, before her suspension was announced, Hill wrote, “Just so we’re clear: I‘m not advocating a NFL boycott.”
She went on to say that an unfair burden was being placed on players whose owners directed them to stand for the anthem.",fake

3374,Leaked: Secret EU study confirmed that piracy doesn't hurt sales at all,"The European Union hid surprising study on internet piracy.
 
Back 2013, the European Commission ordered an expensive research study costing €360,000 in taxpayers’ money regarding how piracy affects sales of music, books, movies and video games across the European Union. After a great deal of investigation, the study found that there was no evidence that piracy had an impact on copyrighted sales except for newly released blockbusters and that piracy seemed to be driving the sales of video games. This conclusion was not want the European Commission wanted to hear as they refused to release the results of the study to the public.
 
It is likely that the public would have never found the results of the study if it wasn’t for the concerted efforts of the European Union parliamentarian Julia Reda who has submitted a freedom of information request to make sure that the information is publicly available. She records that while the European Commission initially stalled in releasing the study twice that it is now publicly available. After assessing the evidence, Reda wrote on her blog that, ""With the exception of recently released blockbusters, there is no evidence to support the idea that online copyright infringement displaces sales.” It has been suggested that newly released blockbusters are being singularly affected by the rise of internet-based piracy because of their higher price policy in comparison to the other forms of media covered in the study.
 
Since Reda’s revelation, it has transpired that the European Union have been behaving in a deeply disingenuous manner with regards to the contents of this study. Two European Union Commissioners have been quick to highlight the discovery that internet piracy is driving down ticket sales at the cinema by around 4.4% to argue in favor of stricter copyright laws. However, when they referenced the study to support their argument, they did not mention that the researchers found ‘no robust statistical evidence of displacement of sales by online piracy’ with regards to games, books or music.
 
These revelations have affirmed suspicions among those who oppose the tightening of copyright laws that the European Commission has been behaving disingenuously in the course of this debate. ""This seems to substantiate suspicion that the European Commission was hiding the study on purpose and cherry-picked the results they wanted to publish, by choosing only the results which supported their political agenda towards stricter copyright rules, ""EDRi wrote.
 
Following the release of the document into the public domain, the European Commission has also chosen to make it available to the public by their official channels. However, for those who oppose a tightening of the copyright laws, this action is sure to be considered too little, too late.

992,$998 to Say Hello to Dolly? That’s the Price for Some Front Row Seats,"Among new shows with eye-popping prices is “Springsteen on Broadway,” Bruce Springsteen’s solo concert, which began performances last week and had a top ticket of $875. (Despite efforts by producers to prevent reselling by using a new Ticketmaster system, some tickets to Springsteen are being offered on StubHub for as much as $10,000.)

Premium prices for hot Broadway shows — especially those with limited runs or popular stars nearing the end of their runs — have been climbing as producers try to claim for their investors and artists some of the revenue now going to resellers.
Although the prices are shocking to some consumers, many in the theater industry are sympathetic to the practice as a way to counter a booming secondary market that affects popular music and sports as well.
But Victoria Bailey, who as executive director of the Theater Development Fund both runs the most prominent ticket discounter (TKTS) and is an advocate for greater access to theater, said the stratospheric prices create a problem, both real and perceived.
“More and more people think Broadway tickets are $800 and it stops there, and the question is, ‘Can the industry find a way to make it clear that there are other tickets available?’,” she said.
For some fans, the cost is worth it.
”If there’s something you really want to do, and you can afford it, do it,” said Paul M. Lisnek, a political analyst and theater podcaster in Chicago who paid $750 to see “Hello, Dolly!” from the front row of Broadway’s Shubert Theater this summer. “She’s an icon and a legend,’’ he said of Ms. Midler, who hadn’t been in a Broadway musical in five decades, “and I just thought it was amazing.”
Asked what he thought of a $998 ticket, Mr. Lisnek said “that might turn out to be a bargain compared to what things are going to go for on the secondary market.”

But for others, the prices are just too high. On Friday, John Landrigan, a Memphis retiree, walked up at the box office for “Dolly!” hoping to get tickets to see Ms. Midler before she leaves, but he blanched at the $550 tickets he was offered (or $229 for obstructed view seats) on the Sunday after Thanksgiving.
Photo
Instead, he bought tickets to see Ms. Midler’s replacement, Bernadette Peters, in April, for $125 each.
“Five-hundred and fifty is just too far,” he said. And then, alluding to the film adaptation of the musical, he added, “I can just watch Barbra Streisand and Satchmo on my big TV.”
Many tickets to Broadway shows are available at deep discounts, and many shows are not as expensive as the handful of big hits. But plenty charge top dollar for the best seats — generally center orchestra, side seats just off the aisle, and the first rows of a mezzanine.

During the week that ended Oct. 1, according to figures reported by the Broadway League, six shows sold top-priced seats with face values over $300 — “Hamilton,” which had a top price of $849; “Dolly!,” at $748 (the $998 price is for seats to shows starting late next month); “The Book of Mormon,” at $477; “Dear Evan Hansen” at $448; “Anastasia” at $350; and “Come From Away” at $347.
“Premiums have really changed the game in the last year and a half, because of ‘Hamilton,’” said Merritt F. Baer, a co-founder and president of TodayTix, a company that sells full-price and discounted theater tickets via mobile app. “The sheer fact that it had $849 tickets, and that so many people bought tickets for $1,500 to $2,000” — which were on the secondary market — “made premium pricing so much easier for every show.”
None of the big shows scheduled to open soon on Broadway are pricing as aggressively as “Dolly!,” Springsteen and “Hamilton,” according to ticketing information on the Telecharge and Ticketmaster websites and interviews with producers.
A revival of “The Iceman Cometh,” produced by Mr. Rudin and starring Denzel Washington, appears to have the top premium price among shows that have yet to open, at $350. “Meteor Shower,” a new play by Steve Martin and starring Amy Schumer, as well as a revival of the classic musical “Carousel,” top out at $325; “Frozen,” a Disney adaptation of the hit animated film, at $297, and “Mean Girls,” Tina Fey’s stage adaptation of her hit film, at $277.50.
“Harry Potter and the Cursed Child,” a sequel to the books and the season’s most anticipated play, will have a top premium price of $249, for each of its two parts. But “Potter” will also discount more substantially than many: each performance will have 300 seats priced at $40 or less, including 150 at $20.",fake
3918,False Flag in Vegas Shooting?,"By Jon Rappoport
 
False flags always target the psychological state of mind of the public. Mind control is the goal.
 
To boil it down, a false flag is an operation staged to blame someone for a crime, someone who didn’t commit the crime.
 
Why? Because by blaming that person or group, and by convincing many others to blame that person or group, you achieve an important objective.
 
Simplistic over-exaggerated version: “Last night, a homeless man was found shot dead in an alley. The gun was found next to his body. The Mayor’s fingerprints were on the [planted] gun. The Mayor was arrested at his office. The election nears. The Mayor’s opponent now appears to have a clear path to victory…”
 
Less simplistic version: “…the worst mass shooting in US history. Stephen Paddock, 64, has been named as the Las Vegas shooter. He is dead. He killed 58 people at a concert and wounded 515 others. In the Congress, calls are rising for new gun control laws…”
 
But, as it turns out, the evidence suggests there were multiple shooters in the Mandalay Hotel. Paddock may or may not have been one of them. The overall operation was designed to invoke widespread horror and fear, and usher in new restrictions on gun ownership…
 
 
 
 
 
The other possible shooters in the hotel would have been professionals, tasked with killing as many people as possible at the country music concert.
 
Gun control would not be the only agenda in this false flag.
 
Heavily militarized police all over this country would be another agenda.
 
Putting a significant dent in the economy would be another—if attendance at public events and in crowded public places diminishes.
 
Such a reduction in attendance could even affect political forums and other gatherings where free speech and the right to assemble are vital. (We’ve already seen significant disruptions of these events.)
 
Invoking fear and passivity in the population is another basic agenda. This leads to the attitude: “Let the authorities handle everything.”
 
 
 
 
 
 
We could see new, more outrageous violations of Constitutional search and seizure principles, all in the name of “the need for security.”
 
As in the aftermath of Sandy Hook, there may be new calls for psychiatric screening of the population, including young children, in order to “spot criminals before they commit crimes.” This is sheer madness, because no so-called mental disorder is based on any defining lab test, and many of the prescribed drugs (SSRI antidepressants) push people over the edge into committing violence. —More violence, more calls for psychiatric screening, more drugs, more violence: an escalating scenario and repeating cycle, leading to tighter Control from above.
 
When was the last time you saw a major false flag exposed by the mainstream press, and then admitted to by the actual perpetrators, who then explained their true objectives?
 
Never.
 
False flags are, over the long term, essential to maintaining and expanding the status quo: power is collected and increased at the top, and then exerted downward.
 
Note: All prior analyses I’ve made about the duration of the shooting, and numbers of people killed and injured, are subject to change. Why? Because as yet, we have no accurate reports on how many of the 515 people injured were actually shot versus trampled or hurt in some other fashion. Also, police reports that are emerging differ on the duration of the shooting. The NY Times is talking about roughly 7 minutes. Newsweek suggests the duration is longer.
 
 
American Natural Superfood - Free Sample (Ad)
 
Nevertheless, the background of the purported shooter, Stephen Paddock, gives no indication of any competence with auto weapons, gives no indication he could have dealt with the problems and challenges of using such a weapon—and on top of that, his state of mind at the time, as an non-professional, would have been unstable, to say the least.
 
Any reasonable law-enforcement group investigating this mass shooting would certainly keep its options open, regarding other perpetrators. But that is not what is happening here. The books are closed on this case. There is no going back.
 
The desired result has been achieved. One shooter, mass killings. End of story. Objective achieved.
 
That rush to judgment and “closure” is also a prime feature of the false flag. It has to be.

(Sept. 13, 2017 – Source: Abbie Parr/Getty Images North America)
The media is looking for someone to blame for Thursday night’s loss to the Rays and they seem to have found it. It was days ago, and as the Yankees look toward their make it or break it game against the Twins on Tuesday the rumors are still out there. Fair or not, Gary Sanchez looks to be the scapegoat and some don’t want him behind the plate on Tuesday.
Sanchez has been scrutinized a lot this season for his defense and now suddenly when the Yankees need to focus on putting the best lineup on the field Tuesday there is growing support around media that Austin Romine should be the starting catcher that night. I like Romine, but do I want him catching and taking a DH spot away from another big hitter?
Photo Credit: Kathleen Malone-Van Dyke
A wild pitch and a low ball that should have been caught but instead scooted underneath Sanchez’s glove are causing a lot of doubt in people’s minds. Both Newsday and the NY Daily News are rallying for Romine behind the plate and Sanchez as the DH.
Do I have confidence in Romine defensively? Sure, but I don’t have a lack of confidence in Sanchez either. No offense to Romine, he’s not the same hitter as some of the other guys on the team. Using him in this game means losing a more powerful bat which I am not confident in with a one game playoff spot.
Sanchez is a young kid. He’s had some mistakes and we’ve seen that but we have lived with his defensive blips all season long and still managed to get to the playoffs. I don’t think this is the time to be taking certain guys out of their element and putting them into a position they haven’t been playing consistently all season. Sanchez has a groove and maybe putting him at DH here isn’t the best way to tinker with the lineup here. Experimenting in a one chance game could be a costly mistake.
(Brad Penner/USA Today Sports)
I really want the best bats in the lineup. We have our best pitcher going and we need the best possible offense too so I don’t want to think about who has to sit out just so we can give our backup catcher a night to play. Who do you have sitting on the bench? Aaron Hicks? Todd Frazier? Matt Holliday? It doesn’t add up for me. We’ve had nothing but success so far against the Twins in the playoffs but now is not the time to sleep on them. This isn’t a guaranteed win and we need the best guys on the field.
Sanchez has been one of our best guys all season even with those mistakes. He’s earned his spot, and I know he is going to come out fighting that day. He’s hungry for this game just like the rest of our guys and all fans. I think the media is going a little overboard here. It’s do or die time and I am riding with my everyday catcher here so I hope Joe Girardi does too.

1414,Senate Intelligence Heads Warn That Russian Election Meddling Continues,"That appeared to have made an impression.
“There needs to be a more aggressive whole-of-government approach in terms of protecting our electoral system,” Mr. Warner said. “Remember, to make a change even in a national election doesn’t require penetration into 50 states.”
He added, “You could pick two or three states in two or three jurisdictions and alter an election.”
The Senate Intelligence Committee is one of three committees on Capitol Hill that have opened full-fledged investigations into the relationship between Mr. Trump, his associates and Russia. Given the committee’s jurisdiction over the intelligence community and a strong working relationship between Mr. Burr and Mr. Warner, it has been considered the congressional committee most likely to deliver a substantive report on Russia’s covert efforts.
Mr. Burr and Mr. Warner sought to inspire confidence on Wednesday that the committee remained on course to do so. They later got a boost from Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, who said he concurred with their statements based on his committee’s work.
The senators said that their investigators have pored over nearly 100,000 pages of classified intelligence and documents turned over by the Trump campaign and other associates of the president’s, and they have conducted more than 100 interviews with many of the top officials connected to both the Trump campaign and the intelligence community. Investigators also recently received material from Facebook and, to a lesser extent, Twitter, about advertisements on their platforms linked to Russia.
“This feels like it’s taking a long time. It is taking a long time,” Mr. Warner said. “But getting it right and getting all the facts is what we owe the American people.”
Mr. Burr had expressed a desire this summer to conclude the inquiry by year’s end. But on Wednesday, he all but conceded that with so many avenues of investigation still open — 25 interviews are scheduled for the remainder of October alone — that would not be possible. While he declined to put a date on the investigation’s conclusion, he said that the committee planned to release portions of its findings before the 2018 midterm election primaries.

Still, there were areas of inquiry — and of speculation — that the senators said they felt reasonably confident were benign and could be set aside. They include changes made to the Republican Party platform before last year’s Republican National Convention and vague and unsubstantiated reports of a secret meeting last year at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington between Sergey I. Kislyak, then the Russian ambassador, and Jeff Sessions, then a senator and now the attorney general.

In each case, Mr. Burr said the committee had interviewed all of the relevant witnesses and found no evidence of nefarious action.
“Campaign staff was attempting to implement what they believed to be guidance to be strong, to be a strong ally on Ukraine, but also leave the door open for better relations with Russia,” Mr. Burr said.
Mr. Burr was also unequivocal in saying that the integrity of the vote itself had been preserved, despite Russian attempts to test the vulnerabilities of 21 state election systems.
“We can certifiably say that no vote totals were affected,” Mr. Burr said, “that the tallies are accurate.”
He also repeatedly steered away from criticizing Mr. Trump, who has questioned the validity of intelligence assessments about the election. Mr. Burr said any questions of criminal acts were best left to the Justice Department’s special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.
In regard to other areas, the senators acknowledged that their work was either stuck or inconclusive. Mr. Burr said they had thus far been unable to get traction on the so-called Steele dossier, a series of memos with sensational claims about Mr. Trump and Russia. The memos’ author, Christopher Steele, a former British intelligence agent, has not agreed to meet with investigators or the senators.
“The committee cannot really decide the credibility of the dossier without understanding things like who paid for it, who were your sources and sub-sources,” Mr. Burr said. Without Mr. Steele’s input, he continued, the committee had found it “impossible” to rebuild the dossier beyond a certain date.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
And the committee has only just begun examining more than 3,000 ads turned over on Monday by Facebook. The company said the ads had been purchased by pages and profiles linked to the Internet Research Agency, a secretive company known for spreading Kremlin-linked propaganda, and investigators believe they are part of a highly coordinated disinformation campaign that sought to sow chaos and exploit divisive social issues.
The senators said that the committee itself would not release copies of the ads, but welcomed Facebook doing so if it so chooses as investigators continue to work to better understand the extent of the social media campaign.
The committee is also waiting for more information from Twitter. The company briefed congressional investigators last week, but Mr. Warner characterized its internal investigation of the issue as derivative and disappointing.
Google has started its own internal investigation and plans to cooperate with Congress. All three companies — Facebook, Twitter and Google — have been invited to testify publicly before the committee on Nov. 1.
Mr. Warner said he was optimistic that the companies were “recognizing that threat now.” He said Americans and political candidates deserved to know who was funding advertisements and why individual posts were trending.",fake
2858,BlackWolfOscar Shows His Growth As An Artist On His Latest Single 'Marigold',"BlackWolfOscar Shows His Growth As An Artist On His Latest Single ‘Marigold’
(Before It's News)
BlackWolfOscar presents 'Marigold' the lead single of his fourth mixtape 'Osmosis.' The growth alluded to in the title of this mixtape is emblematic the creative process Oscar employed while making 'Osmosis'. He has challenged himself to devise extraordinary bars, departing from the generic, trivial topics often covered in music in search of meaningful, poetic lyrics, which describe not only his own artistic journey as a musician, but also provide commentary on the situations surrounding him. 'Osmosis' is the fruit of three years' work. Oscar has spent that time writing and networking with producers abroad to ensure that the kaleidoscope featuring in 'Marigold's' video is representative of the EP as a whole, since the beats underpinning the EP feature a mix of global sounds and genres, whilst the lyrical content of 'Osmosis' features a cornucopia of vocabulary and themes. Having grown as an artist over his previous three mixtapes, Oscar has created a veritable chef d'oeuvre in 'Osmosis.' The striking qualities of Oscar's latest work are all present in 'Marigold.' The track is reminiscent of classic hip-hop, placing a minimalist but club-friendly beat under a series of imaginative metaphors. The opening verse alone relates references to classical Greek mythology and modern art to everyday situations. The wide general knowledge informing Oscar's bars is in part attributable to his degree in Film and Television Production, which enabled him to create art which resonates with people and allows them to form an emotional connection to his work. 'Osmosis' will establish BlackWolfOscar as one of the most talented, creative, young, up and coming artists in the UK.

3139,When is it really time for couples therapy?,"(CNN) I'm often asked when couples should consider therapy. It's common for one partner to be unhappy, feel disconnected or feel that their needs for intimacy aren't being met.
But rather than communicate about it, that partner may open up a metaphorical window with someone else and begin an affair. By the time the couple comes to therapy, the affair itself becomes the main topic, and its underlying causes are often ignored.
The same scenario rings true for other sources of contention, from financial disagreements to sexual concerns. It's clear that couples shouldn't wait until they're in crisis mode to come to therapy, but what should they do?
When is the right time to see a therapist?
Couples should seek therapy long before they think they ""need"" to. Most experts believe that therapy can be an important part of your relationship. ""Most issues within a couple start small and then grow in size when they don't get resolved. This is where therapy can help, by giving tools and techniques to improve conflict resolution,"" explained Kristie Overstreet, a licensed mental health counselor. ""The majority of couples that I work with say that they should have started therapy years earlier.""
""There are three sides to every story: his side, her side and the truth,"" psychotherapist Kimberly Resnick Anderson agreed. ""An objective third party can be just the ticket when couples feel they can no longer communicate effectively.""
Rather than viewing therapy as the solution to a crisis, look at it as an integral aspect of a healthy life, suggested Ashley N. Grinonneau-Denton, marriage and family therapist.
""Every couple should take preventive measures to maintain health in their relationship, just like going to the gym,"" she said. ""If couples don't work their relational and emotional 'muscles,' they become un-toned, weak and create more of a chance of damage being done to their relationship.""
What happens during couples therapy?
Although every therapist is different, there are some commonalities. The first session typically involves the therapist getting to know you, discussing the areas of the relationship they hope to improve and setting goals.
Some, but not all, therapists will assign homework for the couples to work on before the next session. ""Ideally, most of the work gets done, in my experience, outside of my office,"" psychotherapist Samantha Manewitz said.
What problems can benefit from therapy?
Couples come to therapy for any number of reasons, but in my experience, in addition to infidelity, the greatest issues include sex, communication, money and major life changes such as getting married or starting a family. Couples therapy is also a good idea if one of you is coping with an issue that might be affecting your relationship (such as depression) or simply if you're feeling stuck and stagnant in your relationship.
Therapy can provide a safe space to talk about sensitive topics such as sex. ""Just like folks can get caught in a negative relational cycle, couples can often also get stuck in a negative sexual cycle,"" said Michael Moran, a certified sex therapist. ""I tell couples that when the sex they're having is worth having, they'll have more of it. And so we need to explore what blocks exist to creating that place between them.""
Communication is also a big concern for couples. But simply talking with each other more isn't the answer. ""There is communication, and then there's effective communication,"" explained Sara Nasserzadeh, a psychologist. ""Both parties need to feel heard, soothed, respected and cared for first. We analyze old communication patterns and then replace them with feasible and more effective ones. These are all worked out collaboratively with the couple and within the context of their everyday life.""
You might also consider couples therapy to help support you at times of major life change and transition. ""Getting married, becoming parents for the first time, moving, changing jobs, losing jobs, becoming empty-nesters, coping after extramarital affairs, recovering from addiction, caring for aging parents -- all of these transitions can destabilize a couple's equilibrium,"" Anderson said. ""Therapy affords couples an opportunity to negotiate these transitions with as little disruption as possible and to explore and honor what a particular transition means to each partner.""
And don't discount the value of couples therapy in helping you and your partner dig yourselves out of a rut.
""Therapy allows couples to talk through their feelings and articulate how their relationship may not be meeting their expectations,"" said James C. Wadley, a licensed counselor. ""More often than not, there is some common ground that may have enabled them to be in the relationship. 'Feeling stuck' can shift if both parties are willing to compromise in a way so that individual needs are met.""
What if one partner refuses to go?
This is a fairly common scenario in couples therapy. How you approach it can make a difference. ""Talk with your partner extensively about why you're feeling you'd like to get into couples therapy,"" Moran said. ""Don't just spring it on them and insist they go.""
If they're still hesitant, remember that you can attend therapy on your own. This alone may have a beneficial effect.
""Instead of waiting for the other person who doesn't want to go to therapy to change, therapy can help strengthen your own self-improvement and personal growth,"" said Marissa Nelson, a marriage and family therapist. The hesitant partner may become impressed by these positive changes and decide to pursue therapy after all.
If you think your own experiences with therapy have piqued your partner's curiosity, let them know that can see the therapist individually as well. ""Often, by letting them know a safety zone will be created, where their voice is heard and fault or blame isn't the goal, the hesitant partner might feel safe to come in,"" psychotherapist Constance DelGiudice explained.
How do you know if your therapist is a good fit?
It helps to do your research before choosing a couples therapist, but the truth is that you won't really know whether they're the right for you and your partner until you get together.
Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.
""I often arrange a phone call first with clients to make sure we are potentially a good fit,"" Nasserzadeh said. ""Once you meet, pay attention to the therapist's communication style, the rational behind their questions and their general approach. ""Any homework they assign should be explained clearly and makes sense to you and your line of logic.""
How long should therapy last?
There's no one-size-fits-all answer to this question. It really depends on the couple and the issues they're working through. For some couples, a few sessions may be all they need to jump-start their relationship, while others may remain in therapy for years.
In general, it's a good idea to see a therapist together until you've met your goals and feel confident that you've gained the skills necessary to navigate the ups and downs of your relationship.",fake

3702,Shooter's girlfriend: 'Never occurred to me' he was planning violence,"(CNN) Marilou Danley said that she was worried her boyfriend, Stephen Paddock, was trying to break up with her when he bought her a cheap ticket to the Philippines about two weeks ago, then wired her money so she could buy her and her family a house there.
But Danley, in a statement read by her attorney, said she didn't know Paddock had planned to carry out a mass shooting.
In her first public remarks since Paddock killed 58 people and wounded close to 500 others in Las Vegas on Sunday night, Danley said Paddock -- a man she described as ""kind"" -- never gave her any clues or any warning ""that something horrible like this was going to happen.""
Before Paddock checked into the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino last Thursday, authorities said had secured a rental at The Ogden, a condominium complex, through a private owner on Airbnb, around the time of the Life is Beautiful concert, which took place September 22 to September 25.
""It never occurred to me in any way whatsoever that he was planning violence against anyone,"" Danley said in the statement.
Danley, who lived with Paddock in Mesquite, Nevada and was out of the country during the shooting, returned to the United States on Tuesday night from the Philippines and spoke to the FBI and the Las Vegas police, her attorney Matt Lombard confirmed.
""I will cooperate fully with their investigation,"" she said in the statement. ""Anything I can do to help ease suffering and help in any way, I will do.""
Danley said she was ""devastated by the deaths.""
Motive still a mystery
Almost three days after the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history, investigators appear no closer to answering the question: Why?
Danley's statement sheds little light on what led the 64-year-old retired accountant to fire from his 32nd-floor hotel room window into a crowd of 22,000 concertgoers in the heart of Las Vegas.
Why did he continue firing with an arsenal of weapons for nine to 11 minutes? Paddock's motive and aims still remain a mystery to investigators.
FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe told CNBC on Wednesday that the lack of a clear motive was a ""surprise"" in this mass shooting.
""This one is somewhat different than many of the ones we've dealt with in the past, because we don't have any immediately accessible thumbprints that would indicate the shooter's ideology or motivation, or really what compelled him to get there,"" McCabe said.
Stephen Paddock
Police believe Paddock acted alone when he sprayed gunfire on the crowd at the Route 91 Harvest festival.
McCabe told CNN that the FBI was going through Paddock's communications, financial records, associates and video surveillance -- anything to try to piece together the puzzle of his motive.
""We will look at every one of those lanes, pull every possible thread,"" he said.
Authorities are hoping to find answers from their interview with Danley on Wednesday.

Girlfriend 'sent away' before attack
In an interview with CNN affiliate Seven Network Australia, Danley's sisters said that Danley did not know about the shooting and was ""sent away"" before the attack.
Danley entered the Philippines on September 15 and again on September 25, traveling on her Australian passport, said Maria Antoinette Mangrobang, spokeswoman for the Bureau of Immigration in the Philippines.
Danley's sisters, who were not identified by name and whose faces were blurred, added that Danley would willingly cooperate with investigators.
""Of all the people that they have interviewed ... no one can put the puzzles together -- no one -- except Marilou, because Steve is not here to talk anymore,"" Danley's sister said. ""Only Marilou can maybe help to solve this investigation and what and why he's done this.""
Paddock had wired $100,000 to the Philippines, a law enforcement source said, but officials haven't been able to say exactly when the money transfer took place or who was the recipient. The FBI is working with Philippine authorities to determine details.
Danley did not say Wednesday how much money Paddock wired her.
President Donald Trump, who visited Las Vegas victims, first responders and heroes on Wednesday , offered his own analysis of the shooter's motives.
""He's a sick, demented man,"" Trump said. ""The wires are screwed up.""
Paddock's violent transformation has mystified everyone -- his brother , investigators and the families he victimized included.
Paddock, who was twice divorced, liked to gamble, and at one time had jobs at the US Post Office and the IRS, had no significant criminal history and was previously unknown to police.
President Trump said that America was a ""nation in mourning"" on Wednesday and praised the work of first responders, hospital staff, local leaders and the people of Las Vegas.
""Words cannot describe the bravery that the whole world witnessed on Sunday night,"" he said. ""Americans defied death and hatred with love and with courage.""
""When ... the worst of humanity strikes, and strike it did, the best of humanity responds,"" Trump said. ""Parents and spouses used their own bodies as shields to protect their loved ones. Americans dashed into a hail of bullets to rescue total strangers.""
Separately, a GoFundMe for the victims of Las Vegas has raised almost $9 million as of Wednesday afternoon.
Shooter bought 33 firearms
Rifles lie on the floor and on two chairs pushed together, a photo obtained by the Daily Mail shows.
The evidence laid out by investigators so far shows Paddock meticulously planned the shooting.
He purchased 33 firearms, mostly rifles, between October 2016 and September 2017, according to an ATF spokesperson.
The gunman checked into the room days in advance, stocked a cache of weapons there and set up cameras inside his hotel suite and in the hallway.
The first call reporting shots fired came at 10:08 p.m. Sunday, and the gunfire didn't stop until 10:19 p.m., Clark County Undersheriff Kevin McMahill said. The shooting continued off and on for nine to 11 minutes, he said.
Paddock had an arsenal of weapons in his hotel suite, including bump-fire stocks -- legal devices that enable a shooter to fire bullets rapidly, similar to an automatic rifle.
He had outfitted 12 of his firearms with the bump stocks, said the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.
The killer also had cameras set up inside and outside the suite. Police don't know if the devices were transmitting -- the FBI is investigating their use -- but the Clark County sheriff said he thinks Paddock might have used them to watch for people approaching his room. One camera looked out the peephole on the suite's door.
The hail of gunfire stopped when security guards approached Paddock's room at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, McMahill said. Paddock turned his attention to those outside his door and fired, wounding one of them.
The guard was ""very heroic"" and provided police with information about the shooter's location, McMahill said. When officers entered the hotel room, they found Paddock dead. Authorities believe he killed himself.
Wounded security guard recovering
David Hickey, president of the union representing the hotel's officers, identified the wounded guard on Wednesday as Jesus Campos.
Paddock had barricaded the stairwell doors and pointed his makeshift cameras system toward the elevator as Campos approached, said Hickey, head of the International Union, Security, Police and Fire Professionals of America.
Campos, who was shot in the right leg, was out of the hospital on Wednesday. He was expected to have a round removed from his leg at a later date, Hickey said.
The union has seventeen armed officers at Mandalay Bay. Hickey was uncertain if Campos was armed.
Assault-style rifles strewn across room
A photo published by the Daily Mail shows long guns, a hammer and a stack of magazines for rifles.
The UK's Daily Mail newspaper published several photos taken in Paddock's room after the shooting.
They show semi-automatic assault-style rifles on the floor and on furniture. Stacks of ammunition magazines used in rifles can also be seen. One photo shows Paddock's legs splayed on the floor near several weapons, apparently after he killed himself. Police said they're investigating the source of the leaked photos.
The rifles in the photographs were far from the gunman's only weapons. A total of 47 guns have been recovered from three locations: Paddock's hotel room and his two Nevada homes in Verdi and Mesquite.
The guns were bought in Nevada, Utah, California and Texas, said Jill Snyder, special agent in charge of ATF field division in San Francisco.

Coach Jorge Sampaoli was speaking after a Lionel Messi hat-trick against Ecuador - the 44th of his career - ensured Argentina survived a scare to reach the World Cup finals.
The 2014 runners-up began the day sixth in the group, knowing only a top-four place would see them qualify automatically for Russia.
They made a terrible start in Quito, conceding inside 38 seconds, but the Barcelona superstar led Argentina's fight back to ensure they secured their place in next year's tournament.
It was part of a remarkable night of football that saw:

Argentina
Argentina fans celebrated following their qualification for the World Cup in 2018
Messi said it would have been ""crazy"" had Argentina not qualified for Russia 2018, but it took his intervention to ensure they reached their 12th consecutive World Cup.
Ecuador scored in the first minute, taking advantage of Argentina's hesitancy, before Messi struck twice before half-time to calm some nerves.
His third, a lofted chip over goalkeeper Maximo Banguera, saw his country win for the first time in the Ecuadorian capital since 2001 and, crucially, reach next year's World Cup.
Sampaoli warned against Argentina depending too much on Messi - despite it being a remarkable 11 months since any other Argentina player scored for the national team in a World Cup qualifier.
""Today, luckily, the nationality of the best player in the world is Argentinean,"" Sampaoli continued.
""We must be sure everything does not depend on Leo but today he brought his great ability. I told the group we should help him be in the World Cup.""

Panama
Nestled between Kuwait and Moldova as the world's 131st most populous nation, Panama's biggest football achievement up until Tuesday evening was finishing as runner-up in the 2013 Gold Cup.
Now, they have reached their first World Cup - but it was not without controversy, because the Gabriel Torres' header that drew Panama level with Costa Rica did not appear to cross the line.
Despite furious complaints from the visitors, the goal stood, and Roman Torres struck in the final few minutes to send Panama through.
It was a neat reversal of fortunes for Panama, who missed out on qualifying for the last World Cup after conceding two goals in stoppage time against the US in 2013.
This time, though, it was their 87th-minute winner that ensured their place in Russia - at the expense of the US.
President of Panama Juan Carlos Varela declared a national holiday following their victory
United States
In contrast to Panama, the United States has a population of 323.1 million. Their opponents on Tuesday, Trinidad and Tobago, have a population of 1.3m - roughly the same as the US state of Maine.
Described as the ""most surreal and embarrassing night in US soccer history"" and ""simply devastating"" by American journalists, the players were left in tears following their shock 2-1 loss.
""It's a blemish for us. We should not be staying at home for this World Cup and I take responsibility,"" coach Bruce Arena said of a team ranked 28th in the world.
""We failed on the day. No excuses. We failed today. We should have walked off this field with at least a point.""
This is the first time the US have failed to qualify for the World Cup since 1986
Journalist Alicia Jessop drew parallels with the national women's team
Captain Michael Bradley described the night as the ""perfect storm"".
""Everything that could have possibly gone wrong did, in this stadium and in two other stadiums across the [Concacaf] region,"" he added.
""To give away the first goal like that [an own goal] is a killer. But the reality is it was all there for us, and we have nobody to blame but ourselves.""
A draw would have been enough for the United States to automatically qualify
Chile & Portugal
Brazil ended Chile's slim hopes of reaching the World Cup as their 3-0 victory pushed Alexis Sanchez and company from third to sixth in the qualifying group.
Midfielder Arturo Vidal, who missed the game through suspension, announced his retirement following the loss and tweeted that ""my soul is destroyed"".
""Thanks boys, for everything, for all these years together giving our lives in every game,"" the 30-year-old wrote.
Chile's Argentinean manager Juan Antonio Pizzi also left his post after Tuesday's disappointment.
While it was misery for Sanchez, another superstar forward, Cristiano Ronaldo, was smiling as Portugal avoided the play-offs to guarantee their fifth consecutive World Cup appearance with a 2-0 victory over Switzerland.
But the Netherlands - third in the 2014 tournament - are out, despite beating Sweden 2-0.
The Dutch needed a seven-goal win to nudge their opponents out of the play-off berth behind group winners France.

Suburban Symphony have teamed up with startup indie label Hilltown Records to release their debut single ""Stepping Stones"" via all major digital retailers and streaming outlets on 1st August 2017. Stepping Stones provides a great introduction to what the band is all about as it features massive vocal hooks, a stadium-worthy chorus and tasteful guitar work all combined seamlessly with lyrics that ruminate on working class aspiration and dreams of bigger things to come. Since they formed in Barnoldswick in 2014, Suburban Symphony have undertaken a busy schedule of songwriting, recording, gigging (with the likes of Bruce Foxton, The Feeling and Big Country) and have even inspired the establishment of a record label to promote their music. Hilltown Records was formed in early 2017 by Mat Arnold and Keiron Melling, after they had finished recording and mixing Suburban Symphony's debut album at Hilltown Studios. Mat and Keiron (who collectively have worked with such artists as The Fall, Peter Gabriel, Kanye West, Jay-Z, The Noisettes, Aziz Ibrahim and Tom Jones) were so happy with the finished album that they decided to form Hilltown Records and release the material themselves.

1792,Ireland to play Pakistan in first men's Test match in May,"Niall O'Brien narrowly fails to run out Shoaib Malik as Ireland beat Pakistan in a one-day international in August 2016
Ireland's first men's Test match will be on home soil against Pakistan in May 2018, with the exact dates and venue still to be revealed.
An agreement between the two countries was reached during the International Cricket Council meeting in Auckland.
Ireland and Afghanistan were given Test status in June when they became the 11th and 12th full members of the ICC.
Cricket Ireland has since been looking for suitable opponents for an historic first match.
""We are excited to welcome Pakistan to Ireland for our inaugural Test match next year,"" said Ireland CEO Warren Deutrom.
""It has been our wish to make our Test debut in front of our own fans within 12 months of becoming a Test nation, and against a big team - so I'm delighted.""
Pakistan were top of the Test match rankings as recently as last year before slipping back after the retirement of captain Misbah-ul-Haq and senior batsman Younus Khan.
""There is a lot of work to do from now to ensure that it will be an occasion to remember but we, and I'm sure our players and fans, can't wait to rise to it,"" Deutrom added.
""We would like to thank the Pakistan Cricket Board most sincerely for agreeing to be our first opponent in Test cricket - the Pakistan team has been a regular visitor to our shores in recent years, and their agreement to be our opponent on this important occasion for Irish cricket is further evidence of their terrific support.""
Ireland's first Test - or is it? Ireland's women have played one Test - also against Pakistan - in Dublin in July 2000, when the Irish won by an innings and 54 runs.
Irish captain William Porterfield welcomed confirmation of the match, saying: ""It's fantastic news for Irish cricket. It's going to be a bit special and it's always great to be a part of history.
""There's a special affinity between ourselves and Pakistan going back to the 2007 World Cup and they've been regular tourists here over the past decade.
""Test cricket is the pinnacle of our sport and I know how much this game will mean to not only the players but all involved with Irish cricket. It'll be another step on what has been an incredible journey for our sport in a relatively short passage of time.
""It's sure to be an incredible and emotional experience for all involved. I know how much this will mean to all the players and just how much we all will forward to our dream of being Test cricketers realised.

http://robertsiciliano.com/
Are you making a big home security mistake? If you are leaving your doors unlocked, or if you are using low quality lock systems, you are putting yourself…and your home…at risk.
However, just because your door is locked, it doesn’t mean that a burglar can’t kick the door down. But, having the door locked can make it more difficult. This is only one secret that your local locksmith won’t tell you, but there are several more. Here are a few:
Securing Your Doors
Reinforce the door frame around the hinge and lock. Consider door reinforcement kits, such as Door Devil.
Install a peephole.
Don’t answer the door unless you are expecting a visitor. Tell the same to your kids.
Install hardened steel deadbolts. These are highly encouraged. Make sure they have a five-pin tumbler, too.
Consider multi-lock deadbolts or vertical deadbolts.
Accessories for Your Door to Make it More Secure
Consider a door brace. These will help to prevent a burglar from opening the door.
A wedge or door stop will likely not totally stop a burglar, but if you choose one with an alarm, anyone in the home will definitely hear it.
A door chain will not protect you. It doesn’t take a lot of pressure to break them.
Additional Tips for Door Security
Replace your hollow wood door with a metal or solid wood door.
Choose a door that does NOT have a window. An intruder can easily break a window and access the lock.
If you have a current door that DOES have a window, install attractive metal bars over the glass.
Make sure the hinges of the door are not visible on the outside of the door.
Consider installing a cross bar. This is a heavy steel bar that you can place across the inside of the door.
Inspect deadbolts. Any deadbolt that is low quality should be replaced. If you want to have even more security, install a second deadbolt.
Use door braces when you can. Take one of these braces and stick it under the knob of the door. The other end will remain on the floor at an angle to the doorknob. These are great devices, but too many people forget to put the brace up before they go to bed or leave the home. It is useless if it is just leaning against the wall, and it only takes a couple of seconds to put into place.
For the best door security, think about installing some type of door reinforcement kit. Imagine how secure your door would be with 1/16-inch of heavy steel. No one could kick through that! Also, imagine a four-foot metal bar that you install right over the strike plates and screw directly into the frame of the door. This will give you one tough security system on your door, and it’s exactly what the door jamb security kit from Door Devil offers. See here on YouTube.

3535,Dave Doeren has finally gotten that signature win,"Dave Doeren has finally gotten that signature win
(Before It's News)
The tenure of Dave Doeren has been an interesting one at NC State. He was brought in to win games, and in his first 4 seasons it was looking rocky. He was not beating teams that he should have (last year ECU, BC are just 2 of those examples). The fan base was becoming very restless in Raleigh. The complaints were many, and wide ranging. There was the dismissal of Offensive Coordinator Matt Canada, there was “he lacked personality,” and then there was the no signature wins. No wins against teams that he had less “talent” than. That all ended on Saturday, with the Wolfpack’s victory against Florida State. Now, people will say, that the reason that NC State won is because FSU lost Deonndre Francois. Others will say it was because of the ref’s and some questionable calls (yes, there were some). Still others will say it was because of the 2 week layoff that the Seminoles had because of Hurricane Irma (this is the only one I’ll give you). Through all of this, Dave Doeren’s team came out and did what it needed to do. The Wolfpack defensive line was dominant, making life hell for FSU’s true freshman quaterback. The offense was balanced rushing the ball 37 times and passing 33 times.
Dave Doeren has been working on all of the things that critics have been throwing at him. If you watched him on The Coaches Room during the National Championship game last season, you saw the personality come out! He was funny and engaging! Dave Doeren needed this game against FSU! He won against a team that will be a top 25 team at the end of the season! Now all he has to do, is not allow this team to rest on this win and continue carrying on that intensity that they took to Doak Campbell Stadium this past Saturday.

DACA
President Donald Trump, who pledged to help protect young people known as “Dreamers” brought illegally to the United States as children, called for money to fund a border wall to be part of any immigration deal. In a list of “principles” laid out in documents released by the White House, the Trump administration also pressed for a crackdown on unaccompanied minors who enter the United States, many of them from Central America.
The plan, which was delivered to leaders in Congress on Sunday night, drew a swift rebuke from Democrats, who are seeking a legislative fix for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program that Trump ended last month.

426,"Food Truck Giving Free Food to Hurricane Workers, Kicked Out of Town for Not Having a Permit","By Matt Agorist
Green Cove Springs, FL — After Irma devastated Florida, most restaurants and stores were shut down in certain areas. Green Cove Springs was one of those places. So, when Jack Roundtree, owner of the Triple J BBQ food truck, arrived in town, not only was he welcomed with open arms — he was desperately needed. As he sold BBQ to paying customers, Roundtree used the extra money to feed utility workers for free for all their hard work. However, once officials saw a man who’d dare sell food in their town without paying them first, police were called in to make quick work of this entrepreneurial good Samaritan.
Shut down and get out of town—is what Roundtree was told by local authorities for both providing charity and a much-needed product and service. Why was Roundtree told to get out of town, you ask? Well, he hadn’t paid the local government for the ‘privilege’ to sell food to those in need inside Green Cove Springs.
Roundtree is no outlaw. In fact, Green Cove Springs actually encouraged him to sell his BBQ during their monthly Saturday-in-the-Park event before the hurricane. But not this time.
Even if he would’ve gone to city hall to buy a permit to sell during the Irma aftermath, however, he couldn’t—they were closed.
According to Clay Today:
It was interesting to learn that Roundtree and his truck were encouraged to serve customers during Green Cove’s monthly Saturday-in-the-Park event without a permit, but during Irma’s aftermath, not so much. Had Roundtree decided to press his case at City Hall, he would have been greeted with a sign that read: ‘Due to Hurricane Irma, City Hall offices and services will re-open on Thursday, Sept. 14, 2017.’
So, instead of allowing Roundtree to offer free food to utility workers and sell food to people during their time of need, and just get a permit after government employees decided to return to work—they just kicked him out of town.
Here’s how one Green Cove Spring witness, Bettie Tune, described the events at Rich’s on her Facebook page, as reported by Clay Today:
The irony here is that he was kicked out of town for failing to get a permit by government workers because the other government workers who would’ve given him this permit, were not at work.
In a report from the Institute for Justice, Communications Coordinator, Matt Powers explains that Roundtree is not alone.
Cities across the country often impose strict regulations that make it nearly impossible for food trucks to operate. In 2011, IJ launched its National Street Vending Initiative to fight these laws. In Baltimore, the Institute for Justice (IJ) is challenging a ban on food trucks parking within 300-foot of a brick-and-mortar business that sells the same type of food. In Chicago, IJ is challenging regulations that bans food trucks from operating within 200 feet of a brick-and-mortar business serving food and forces them to install GPS tracking devices that broadcast their every move. And IJ is challenging a Louisville, Kentucky, law banning food trucks from operating within 150 feet of any restaurant selling similar food.
These strict regulations are ostensibly designed for food safety, but in reality, serve to raise revenue for the state and limit established restaurants’ competition. They also stifle economic growth.
As the IJ noted:
FREE Stormproof, Waterproof Survival Match Kit (Ad) It is not only during times of crisis that food trucks contribute to their communities. According to IJ’s report Streets of Dreams mobile vending businesses help people escape poverty and unemployment through affordable start-up costs which creates the initial economic opportunity for upward mobility. IJ’s report, Seven Myths and Realities found the presence of food trucks can actually help local restaurant industries by attracting new customers and serving as incubators for new restaurants. Cities should embrace food trucks and liberate them from onerous regulations so they can enjoy the benefits these businesses bring.
When people in need are denied food they are willing to purchase because government workers aren’t in the office to sell the maker of that food a permission slip, something is wrong in the land of the free.
As TFTP reported earlier this month, this problem is everywhere. It stifles local economic growth, persecutes the poor the hardest, and turns hard-working entrepreneurs into criminals, ripe for the extortion of state.

2042,Trump hits a new low in attacks on the free press,"President Trump's disregard for a free press just reached a new low: He's urging the Senate Intelligence Committee to investigate American news outlets for publishing ""fake"" stories.
Or maybe he's just venting about news coverage he hates.
As with many of Trump's tweets, this one can be interpreted several ways. But taken literally, these are 140 shocking characters -- words that certainly piqued the interest of First Amendment attorneys.
The president wrote Thursday morning, ""Why Isn't the Senate Intel Committee looking into the Fake News Networks in OUR country to see why so much of our news is just made up-FAKE!""
The simplest answer is that the news is not ""made up.""
More to the point, the intelligence committee is busy investigating Russian interference in last year's presidential election. The Republican and Democratic co-chairs held a press conference on Wednesday to update the public. The investigation has ""expanded,"" they said, and will continue for several more months.
But Trump has repeatedly rejected the bipartisan alarm bells about Russian meddling. At least once a month, he tells his supporters that ""Russia"" is a ""hoax.""
Related: Trump says this is all a hoax. Mueller, Congress and Facebook disagree.
Outside Trumpworld, there is almost universal agreement that Russia's attempts to influence American elections are an ongoing and urgent problem. There are many outstanding questions about whether members of Trump's campaign coordinated with Russian operatives.
Trump's reaction to his giant Russia problem? Beat the press.
A sub-theme of his campaign was the attempted delegitimizing of the press corps covering him. As president, he frequently alleges that news is ""fake"" when the coverage isn't as positive as he wants it to be. But Thursday's tweet -- invoking an investigation -- goes further than he's gone before.
""This is the kind of statement one expects to hear from a despot, not from an American president,"" said Jameel Jaffer, the director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University.
""The free press is a pillar of our democracy, not a threat to it,"" Jaffer said. ""Calling on the intelligence committee to investigate the press is particularly absurd. That committee was established after the national-security abuses of the 1950s, '60s, and early '70s to help ensure that the government's national security policies don't compromise constitutional freedoms -- including the freedom of the press.""
Preet Bharara, one of the former U.S. attorneys who was fired by Trump earlier this year, tweeted this interpretation of Trump's statement: ""POTUS desperately wants to direct who should be investigated & who should be immune. He wants scrutiny for adversaries, amnesty for allies.""
Here are several other ways to interpret it:
--Trump would genuinely like to see a government probe into the internal workings of American news organizations like CNN and NBC. Such a probe would surely provoke First Amendment challenges.

So far, the Trump administration's bark about the media has been much worse than its bite. Trump frequently assails ""fake"" news coverage, but the White House press corps is operating pretty much the way it has for decades, without draconian new restrictions.
However, his words carry power, and a portion of Trump's political base takes his anti-media attacks very seriously.
Trump may be ratcheting up his criticism of the press as special counsel Robert Mueller's probe moves forward and the midterm elections approach.
He frequently asserts that journalists invent anonymous sources to fit their agendas. But there's scant evidence to back up that bombastic claim.
While journalists do make mistakes, and are often held accountable, outright fabrication is extremely unusual and is taken extraordinarily seriously.
But Trump tells a very different story through his tweets.
He used his Twitter account on Thursday to deny Wednesday's report by NBC News that Tillerson was on the verge of resigning over the summer.
""Rex Tillerson never threatened to resign. This is Fake News put out by @NBCNews,"" Trump tweeted. ""Low news and reporting standards. No verification from me.""
NBC reiterated that it stands by its reporting.",fake

3026,"Special Report: In blocking arms to Yemen, Saudi Arabia squeezes a starving population","FILE PHOTO: Rasha Sadeq Ahmed, 4, is held by her mother in the malnutrition treatment center at the al-Sabeen hospital in Sanaa, Yemen, April 13, 2017. REUTERS/Khaled Abdullah/File Photo
DJIBOUTI (Reuters) - Late last year, the Kota Nazar, a Singaporean ship with 636 containers of steel, paper, medicine and other goods, set sail to Hodeida, the largest cargo port in war-torn Yemen.
It never got there. Like dozens of other ships carrying food and supplies to Yemen over the past 30 months, the Kota Nazar was stopped by a Saudi Arabian warship blocking Yemen’s ports on the Red Sea.
Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies have been stationing naval forces in and around Yemeni waters since 2015. Western governments approved the show of military force as a way to stop arms reaching Houthi fighters trying to overthrow Yemen’s internationally recognized government.
The de facto blockade is exacting a dire humanitarian toll. The Saudi-led coalition’s ships are preventing essential supplies from entering Yemen, even in cases where vessels are carrying no weapons, according to previously unreported port records, a confidential United Nations report and interviews with humanitarian agencies and shipping lines.
A U.N. system set up in May 2016 to ease delivery of commercial goods through the blockade has failed to ensure the Yemeni people get the supplies they need.
The result is the effective isolation of Yemen, a nation of 28 million people where a quarter of the population is starving, according to the United Nations. The war has claimed 10,000 lives. Half a million children under the age of five are severely malnourished, and at least 2,135 people, most of them children, have died of cholera in the past six months.
Aid agencies have ramped up their deliveries of food to some parts of Yemen this year. But Yemen imports more than 85 percent of its food and medicine, and commercial shipments have plunged. In the first eight months of this year, only 21 container ships sailed to Hodeida, according to port data compiled by the U.N. World Food Programme and Reuters. By comparison, 54 container ships delivered twice the volume of goods in the same period last year. Before the war, 129 container ships reached the port in the first eight months of 2014.
Food and medicine are being choked off. No commercial shipment of pharmaceuticals has made its way to Hodeida since a Saudi-led airstrike destroyed the port’s industrial cranes in August 2015, according to the administrator of the port, which is under Houthi control. In at least one case this year, a blocked commercial shipment contained humanitarian aid as well.
Representatives of the Houthi movement could not be reached for comment. Yemeni government officials declined to comment.
Abdallah Al-Mouallimi, the Saudi ambassador to the U.N., denied last week that the coalition was blocking commercial shipments of food, medicine and fuel. Mouallimi said Yemen was receiving humanitarian aid.
”I can assure you that no shipment of humanitarian aid is being prevented from reaching Yemen by the coalition or for that matter by the Yemeni government. We have given clearance to all such requests for docking by any ship that carries humanitarian aid to the people of Yemen.
“We are the largest contributor of aid to the people of Yemen so it doesn’t make sense for us to, on the one hand, be providing that aid and, on the other hand, be blocking it somewhere else.”
In the cases of the Kota Nazar and 12 other ships examined in detail by Reuters, the Saudi-led blockade turned away or severely delayed vessels carrying aid and commercial goods before they reached Yemeni ports even though the United Nations had cleared the cargo and there were no arms aboard. Seven of those vessels were carrying medicine and food in addition to other supplies.
Aid shipments are caught in the net. One of the seven vessels was carrying antibiotics, surgical equipment and medication for cholera and malaria for 300,000 people. The shipment was held up for three months, during which $20,000 worth of medicine was damaged or expired, according to U.K.-based aid group Save the Children.
In July, four oil tankers carrying 71,000 tonnes of fuel, equivalent to 10 percent of Yemen’s monthly fuel needs, were denied entry. Two were allowed in after five weeks, port records show.
In a report published last month, Human Rights Watch said that the Saudi-led coalition “arbitrarily diverted or delayed” seven fuel tankers headed to Houthi-controlled ports between May and September this year. In one case, a vessel was held in a Saudi port for more than five months, the group said.
Early this summer, Yemen’s internationally recognized government notified the United Nations that it had closed a rebel-held oil port due to its “illegal status” and “damage to the marine environment.”
The government is also diverting all vessels carrying cement and iron to the Yemeni port of Aden, which is under its control, according to the U.N.
As a result of the blockade, there have been no commercial flights to Sanaa, Yemen’s capital, since last summer. And two of the world’s biggest container shipping lines — Swiss-based MSC and Singapore-based PIL — stopped sailing to Houthi-held ports in early 2017, because of the delays and dangers involved. PIL has not yet resumed services.
In a confidential report submitted to the Security Council in April, U.N. investigators detailed many of the delays ships have faced getting through the blockade. In one case, a shipping company’s vessels waited 396 days to dock at Hodeida, incurring $5.5 million in fuel and refrigeration costs. The U.N. report also said that the coalition of Saudi Arabia and its allies takes an average of 10 days to grant vessels permission to dock at Hodeida even when the vessels are not delayed.
The United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS), which oversees the U.N.’s clearance system, disputed the World Food Programme’s and Reuters’ count of container cargo delivered to Hodeida port.
In a statement to Reuters, UNOPS said its system, called the U.N. Verification and Inspection Mechanism for Yemen (UNVIM), has cleared vessels to deliver nearly 10 million tonnes of food, fuel and general cargo to Yemen over the past 16 months. UNOPS did not provide evidence for the figure. It also did not specify how many of the ships it cleared were later stopped, delayed or rerouted by the Saudi-led coalition. UNOPS also said that events that transpire in international waters are beyond its remit.
“UNVIM has contributed to meeting the challenges of the current humanitarian crisis as much as possible by making basic commodities available in the Yemeni market,” the U.N. said in a statement.
In at least two private correspondences with U.N. member states and aid agencies this year, UNVIM officials voiced frustration that the Saudi-led coalition stopped or delayed vessels they had cleared. One internal UNVIM report from March said the coalition had delayed six vessels, which were later granted access “after continuous liaison and effort.”
The Saudi coalition isn’t the sole reason for the plunge in imports to Yemen. Foreign banks have cut credit lines to businesses because of concerns about being repaid and difficulties with processing transactions. The Yemeni central bank’s activities have been paralyzed over a tussle between the internationally recognized government and the Houthi fighters.
It is difficult to assess precisely the cumulative commercial and humanitarian effects of the blockade on Yemen. Many parts of the country are inaccessible to relief groups and reporters. Yet the U.N. has warned for more than two years that Yemen is a step away from famine. The World Food Programme estimates that the number of people needing aid has risen to 20 million this year, or more than two-thirds of the population, compared with 17 million in 2016.
Yemen is starving because it is a battleground in a political struggle in the Middle East between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Saudi Arabia and its allies entered the war in Yemen to counter Houthi fighters, a Shi‘ite group backed by Iran.
Western nations, at odds with Tehran over its nuclear program, supported the Saudi-led intervention by helping coordinate airstrikes and refueling Saudi warplanes. The U.N. Security Council effectively supported Riyadh by imposing an arms embargo on the Houthi fighters; it said Yemen-bound vessels could be inspected if there were “reasonable grounds” to suspect they were carrying arms.
Riyadh has never formally drawn a line beyond which ships are not allowed to sail. It has not published a list of goods and materials covered by its restrictions. But it says it has the right “to take all appropriate measures to counter the threats” from Iran-backed rebels. A senior official with Iran’s foreign ministry denied allegations that his country provides financial and military support for Houthis in Yemen.
“Yemen is a catastrophic case. It is the man-made conflict that is driving hunger and driving the conditions for famine. Simple as that,” said David Beasley, executive director of the World Food Programme. “If we end the war, we will end the starvation.”
Some in the United States are beginning to criticize the blockade. Republican Senator Todd Young of Indiana, a member of the U.S. Senate’s Committee on Foreign Relations, said Saudi Arabia might be violating humanitarian laws because it has impeded the flow of needed goods to Yemen.
“I do not suggest that the Saudis share all of the blame for this,” he said, referring to the nine countries in the Saudi-led coalition. “But they share a significant portion of it.”
EARLY WARNINGS

International aid groups grew concerned about the effects of the Saudi blockade in early 2015, shortly after the Saudi-led coalition, which includes the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Bahrain, Kuwait, Jordan, Morocco, Sudan and Senegal, entered Yemen’s civil war. Container shipments to Hodeida in 2015 fell to about 40 percent of their pre-war volume.
That summer, the U.N. issued the first of its many warnings that famine was possible in Yemen. Behind the scenes, the U.N. tried to convince Riyadh and its allies to let it inspect ships.
In early September 2015, the U.N. said it had reached a deal with the Yemeni government and the coalition to set up an inspection system that would facilitate the passage of goods to Yemen. The system, UNVIM, would be headquartered in Djibouti, the U.N. said. It took eight more months to secure the $8 million it needed to start operations.
When UNVIM was started in May 2016, its stated goal was “to restore trust among the shipping community” that there would be no unexpected and costly delays to shipments headed for Yemen.
Since then, all commercial vessels sailing to Yemen’s Houthi-held ports have had to submit an application to the U.N., complete with their cargo manifests and lists of their last ports of call. The U.N. reviews the applications and checks if the vessels have called at suspect ports or have turned off their transponders for more than a few hours - a common trick of smugglers seeking to avoid tracking. Occasionally, UNVIM’s contractors inspect the vessels.
UNVIM does not verify or inspect aid shipments unless they are mingled with commercial goods. Vessels fully chartered by aid agencies go through a different process: They directly obtain sailing rights from Riyadh. Nonetheless, a significant proportion of aid must make its way to Yemen aboard commercial vessels.
In the last 16 months, UNVIM has processed 685 clearances and granted vessels the right to sail to Houthi-held ports about 80 percent of the time. These vessels delivered nearly 5 million tonnes of food, 2 million tonnes of fuel and 2.5 million tonnes of general cargo, the U.N. told Reuters.
But even after the U.N. grants clearances, all commercial ships have to get approval from a Saudi-managed warship stationed 61 km west of Hodeida port.
This has proven difficult. Because the vessels are anchored in international waters, UNVIM can only coordinate with regional parties, including the coalition, to facilitate vessels’ access to the ports, the U.N. said in its statement. The rest of the process is up to local port authorities, it said.
SUSPICIONS
The Kota Nazar, for example, had obtained U.N. clearance to sail to Hodeida in late December. But naval officers from the Saudi warship stopped and boarded it.

The officers suspected that the ship carried concealed Iranian arms destined for the Houthi fighters. They ordered the Kota Nazar back to Djibouti, its previous stop. There, the vessel’s crew offloaded 62 containers the coalition deemed suspicious, allowing the ship to set sail again for Hodeida in January.
Then the Saudi-led coalition insisted on another inspection. Three days later, the U.N. ordered the vessel to sail to Jizan, Saudi Arabia. In Jizan, local authorities and two U.N. inspectors offloaded every container aboard the vessel and X-rayed them. They held back 27 containers with cargo they said could be used in the Yemeni military conflict. The contents included bullet-cartridge belts, as well as iron pipes, welding electrodes, motorcycle parts and other manufactured goods.
In Djibouti, U.N. and local officials searched the containers the ship had left behind. They found rolled steel in nearly half of the containers and printing paper in others. Two containers carried refrigerated medicine that came from one of Iran’s biggest cargo ports, Bandar Abbas.
The inspectors also found traces of high-grade explosives in one container of printing paper that came from Jakarta, Indonesia, according to U.N. officials in Yemen. However, the search did not turn up any explosives.
Experts say false positives are common during routine inspections for explosives. PIL, the Singapore-based shipping line that owns the Kota Nazar, said it does not discuss commercial operations.
In the end, the Kota Nazar could not obtain clearance to sail to Hodeida. It sailed instead to Aden, a southern port under the government’s control. Aid and commercial cargo that land in Aden must cross hundreds of checkpoints on the road north to Houthi-held regions, a dangerous and expensive journey.
After that incident, PIL canceled all future voyages to Hodeida and other Houthi-held ports in the Red Sea.
Other shipments have been blocked, although they contained no arms. Earlier this year, the coalition turned back four cranes the United States donated to the World Food Programme to boost aid operations at Hodeida port. The cranes would have replaced parts of the port’s infrastructure destroyed by coalition airstrikes in August 2015.
In January, the WFP sent the cranes on a ship to Hodeida. But the Saudi-led coalition revoked the clearance it had issued earlier that month and blocked the vessel. The ship waited at sea for 10 days before eventually sailing back to Dubai, where the cranes remain.
The WFP says the coalition did not provide a clear reason for turning back the cranes.
In April, a coalition spokesman told the BBC the cranes were blocked “because we don’t want to continue to enhance the capabilities of the Houthis to generate money and to smuggle” weapons.
In August, Saudi Arabia’s mission to the United Nations said it would install cranes at three ports under the internationally recognized government’s control, citing Yemen‘s “deteriorating humanitarian situation.”
Last week, Mouallimi, the Saudi ambassador to the U.N., said Saudi Arabia had offered equipment to increase the capacity of Yemeni ports other than Hodeida, saying that the Houthis used revenue from Hodeida to buy arms rather than fight cholera.
Mouallimi was speaking after the U.N. this month blacklisted the Saudi-led military coalition for killing and injuring 683 children in Yemen and attacking dozens of schools and hospitals in 2016. The blacklist also named the Houthi movement, Yemen government forces, pro-government militia and Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula for violations against children in 2016.
The world’s second-biggest container shipping line, Swiss-based MSC, has also faced challenges with its journeys. One of MSC’s vessels, the Himanshi, was delayed for two months in summer 2016 when it attempted to sail to Hodeida, according to the WFP and the unpublished U.N. report. The Himanshi was carrying 722 containers of goods, of which 93 held food and other aid cargo.
The coalition held back the vessel in the Red Sea for 13 days until the U.N. directed it to the King Abdullah Port in Saudi Arabia. Inspectors there found fireworks in a few containers, according to the U.N. report. The coalition never clarified the grounds for the inspection, and the vessel didn’t reach Hodeida until early September.
“A lot of the cargo we carry in this region has a limited shelf life. For example, foodstuffs and chilled or frozen food,” an MSC spokesperson said.
“MSC continues to closely monitor the ease of access to the port of Hodeida, which has been inadequately served in recent months due to lengthy and sometimes unpredictable delays from cargo inspections.”
MSC stopped sailing to the Red Sea ports for eight months this year. It said in August that it was resuming services to Hodeida at the request of customers, including U.N. agencies and private importers.
Civilians continue to feel the blockade’s chokehold.
Ali Shoui, a 38-year-old father of four, said he fled from a rebel-held northern province when he could not feed his children. The price of a bag of flour doubled after the blockade, he said, and pharmacies ran out of stock. Doctors who worked at the nearby hospital left because they had not been paid for a year. Fuel merchants stopped supplying the area after they were targeted by airstrikes.
“People are no longer able to buy food,” Shoui said. “The situation is really terrifying.”",fake

139,"Trump Threatens WW3 ""Reviewing Plans To Send Weapons To Ukraine""","By Aaron Kesel
President Donald Trump is “actively reviewing” plans to send lethal weapons to Ukraine, according to the U.S Secretary of Defense as to what will be the words heard around the world and the move that starts WW3.
James Mattis has previously stated the United States “stands with Ukraine” after the country’s president, Petro Poroshenko, said there are at least 3,000 Russian troops on Ukrainian’s soil.”
He said Russia has not abided by the Minsk ceasefire agreement meant to end separatist violence in eastern Ukraine.
“Despite Russia’s denials, we know they are seeking to redraw international borders by force, undermining the sovereign and free nations of Europe,” he told reporters.
The eastern European country has been reliant on support from Washington since pro-Western government forces overthrew the Ukrainian leadership in 2013, as warned by Ukraine Deputy Oleg Tsarov, then paid CIA snipers hired by Maidan leaders to shoot at protesters and police according to Polish former presidential candidate Janusz Korwin-Mikke and Urmas Paet.
Russia then had a referendum for Crimea, after which relations between Kiev and Moscow seemingly plummeted deep into the ground.
A leaked phone call further confirmed the assumption that the U.S. planned a coup in Ukraine.
The audio uploaded online showed Victoria Nuland, the then top U.S. diplomat in Europe, and Geoff Pyatt, the U.S. envoy to Kiev, discussing the merits of Ukraine’s various opposition figures and if things were in place. In the recording, Nuland can also be heard saying “f**k the EU,” if they aren’t ready for their alleged plot and to go ahead without them.
Estonian Foreign Minister and High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs, Urmas Paet, c0llaborated and confirmed that snipers had shot at both police and protesters in a conversation with EU foreign Security Policy Catherine Ashton when an additional tape was leaked by Officers of Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) loyal to the ousted President Viktor Yanukovich. Paet said that snipers who shot at protesters and police in Kiev were hired by Maidan leaders.
The Trump administration now wants to aid the Obama administration’s deep state previous effort to start a war with Russia and destabilize the Ukraine by getting involved in yet again more proxy wars.
Tensions have risen between the U.S. and Russia over the past year, from baseless allegations that Russia hacked the U.S. election to Russia conducting military drills around the Ukraine, and NATO and the U.S. matching the aggression with Operation Atlantic Resolve.
Now, Kiev wants the U.S. to supply lethal “defensive weapons,” a move the previous administration under Barack Obama kept off the table and avoided choosing a more covert method.
“On the lethal defensive weapons, we are actively reviewing it, I will go back now having seen the current situation and be able to inform the secretary of state and the president in very specific terms what I recommend for the direction ahead,” Mattis, a former Marine Corps general, said. “Defensive weapons are not provocative unless you are an aggressor, and clearly Ukraine is not an aggressor since it is their own territory where the fighting is happening,” Mattis said.
In January, scores of tanks and other U.S. military vehicles, as well as 3,500 troops, were sent to Germany and Poland to take part in the ongoing military operation.
Mid March U.S. and Polish forces conducted another drill in Poland, and Russia responded doing unexpected exercises according to Ukrainian Defense Ministry’s Spokesperson for ATO Andriy Lysenko.
Then in April, the United States lead a battalion of NATO troops in northeastern Poland.
Just several months ago in May, the drills expanded into Romania across the Black Sea from Crimea. June saw NATO allies run another drill named Anakonda-16, which included a nighttime helicopter assault practice and the dropping of U.S. paratroopers to build a temporary bridge. That drill saw the participation of an estimated 30,000 troops.
Finally, just last month the U.S. Romania conducted another drill involving fighter jets.
Russia is planning for its annual exercise a large-scale drill dubbed Zapad (West) with an estimated 100,000 people in Belarus, Kaliningrad, and Russia itself to take place later this month on September 14th – 20th. However, the real numbers are 5,500 Russian and 7,200 Belarusian troops, about 70 aircraft, 250 tanks and 200 artillery systems and 10 navy ships and they pose no threat,” according to Russia’s Deputy Defense Minister, Lt. Gen. Alexander Fomin.
Polish Deputy Minister of National Defense Michal Dworczyk expressed concern about Russia’s drills despite a meeting of the Russia-NATO Council in Brussels, where the Russian side informed the alliance of the Zapad-2017 exercises, Sputnik reported.
This is the largest military buildup in Europe since the end of the Cold War; all this military movement meant to help ease concerns held by Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and other NATO allies. Instead, this has angered Russia. But as Rand Paul said on Twitter and on the floor of Congress, “They want to rubber stamp. They want no debates, and they want to send your kids to war,” where is the vote for sending weapons to the Ukraine beating on those war drums?

937,Lambeau Field has become a House of Horrors for the Chicago Bears,"Lambeau Field has become a House of Horrors for the Chicago Bears
(Before It's News)
The Chicago Bears took on the Green Bay Packers lastThursday night with full momentum on their side after a thrilling overtime win against the Pittsburgh Steelers. But the momentum was gone after the first play on offense once the game started as Mike Glennon was sacked and fumbled, giving the Packers a quick 14-0 lead. The Bears never recovered. The loss is just another notch added to a growing trend that is terrible for the Bears as this is their 8th loss in their last 10 games on the road against the Packers. Even worse, all but one of those losses has been by 13 points are more and all have been on national television. Since 2011, All the of the Bears Packers games played at Lambeau Field have taken place during primetime, whether it be Sunday, Monday, or Thursday night. The last three contest have all been on Thursday night, with the first one being on Thanksgiving Night back in 2015 which actually was the Bears last win at Lambeau Field with the score being 17-13. The last two losses have been by a combined score of 37 points and the team has had three quarterbacks play as well, as last season starting quarterback Brian Hoyer broke his arm in the game and missed time last season.
Mike Glennon looked a lot like Jay Cutler last night for the Packers. Check out the rest of the highlights here: https://t.co/4CFCsVXHhz pic.twitter.com/OeUqzDbY68 — TheTundraEffect (@TundraEffect) September 29, 2017
The first of the consecutive primetime games came on Christmas Day in 2011 when the Bears were blown out 35-21.That game sawJosh McCown made his first start with Bears, the offense did rack up yards, but did turn the ball over twice. The 2011 team for that game was without quarterback Jay Cutler, running back Matt Forte, and wide receiver Johnny Knox who suffered a career-ending back injury the week before. The loss knocked the Bears out of the playoffs and dropped their record to seven and eight on the season. From 2012 to 2014, The Bears played the Packers in primetime on a different night each year. The first was a Thursday night game in week two of the 2012 season, the Bears were coming off a blow out victory against the Indianapolis Colts in the season opener and were in high spirits going into the game. Jay Cutler threw four interceptions and was sacked seven times as the Bears lost 23-10. In 2013 with new head coach Marc Trestman, Bears played on Monday Night in what would be the signature win in Trestman’s ill-fated coaching career with the Bears. Without Cutler and a very bad pass defense, the Bears upset the Packers 27-20 as backup quarterback Josh McCown started once again and had a phenomenal game throwing two touchdowns and posted a quarterback rating of 90.7. The Packers lost Aaron Rodgers early in the game due to a broken collarbone which was vital for the Bears winning the game. Just as the 2013 game at Lambeau was Trestman’s signature win, almost an exact year later, he would suffer his signature loss as a coach and it marked the beginning of the end of his tenure as Bears head coach. Coming out of a bye week where the week prior the team had been beaten badly on the road against the New England Patriots 51-23, many experts expected the Bears to play the Packers hard, but just the opposite occurred. Aaron Rodgers posted a historic performance as he threw six touchdowns in the first half alone. To make matters worse, it appeared that many Bears players had all but quit on the field as they showed no sense of motivation or pride to fight back to make the game look respectable. The final score was 55-14 and the Bears had set a franchise record giving up a combined 104 points in two games. The recent history at Lambeau is not pretty for the Bears organization or the fan base as coaching staffs and players have change, but results have been the same. What makes matters worse is that all these performances have been witnessed in primetime by a national audience which only enhances the severity of the losses. One can only hope that next season could be the first since 2010 to where the Bears play the Packers in Green Bay on a traditional Sunday afternoon and not in primetime. With the most recent outcome on Thursday evening, there is only hope that this last Bears game in Green Bay will be the last in a very dubious stretch of bad play against a rival that makes up the NFL’s oldest rivalry. The Lions back in 2015 snapped a 24-game losing streak when playing against the Packers in Green Bay, if the Lions did it maybe there’s hope for the Bears.

Trevor Semian had a poor showing in Week 3, with 259 yards, 0 TD and 2 INT, after thriving in his first two starts at home (Week 3 came on the road). This week he returns home to take on an Oakland team that is allowing the fourth most points to opposing quarterbacks per week thanks to 5 TD vs. 0 INT. Look for Semian to get back on track and be worth using in even single-quarterback formats.
The Houston Texans were supposed to be a good defense, though they’ve allowed the seventh most points per week to opposing quarterbacks (727 yards, 6 TD, 0 INT). Coming off a strong showing against the Seattle Seahawks (225 yards, 2 TD, 0 INT) it’s easy to envision Marcus Mariota posting another good stat line. The key for him is going to be throwing for a few TD, something that’s unfortunately not a given considering the running game behind him (he has 3 TD in the first three weeks). That risk keeps his value down slightly, but he’s still a viable option.
Alex Smith has made a splash this season, though it’s important to note that the yardage has been trending down (368 to 251 to 155) and he’s thrown 3 TD over the past two weeks (he had 4 TD in Week 1). Is he moving more towards the “safe” option as opposed to the big play threat we wanted to believe he was? He’s still a borderline QB1, but after Washington silenced the Raiders’ passing game he’s going to be a tough sell.
In two games the Tampa Bay Buccaneers have allowed 670 passing yards, 4 TD and 2 INT. After watching Eli Manning and the Giants’ passing attack finally find its footing late in Week 3 there’s a good chance he continues producing in a big way.
Deshaun Watson tossed for 300 yards, 2 TD and 2 INT against the Patriots, though they obviously needed to throw a lot to try and keep up. While they may not be in the same position this week, he has a favorable offense and the coaching staff is clearly growing comfortable with him. As a QB2, don’t shy away.

% of readers think this story is Fact. Add your two cents.
(Before It's News)
In what may have been their worst game of the year the Jets squeaked out a “butt ugly” 17-14 win over CLE. Thanks to CLE ineptitude in leaving 23 points on the field and wasting timeouts the Jets overcame their poor play to fall into a three way tie for first place. Other than a few key plays there weren’t many positives in the review of the tape. Let’s take a look:
– OLine was spanked in both run & pass blocking. Add in way too many penalties and you have a mess. Credit to CLE DC (Gregg Williams) for breaking out some old school Buddy Ryan “46 Defense” to clamp down on the running game.
– DLine was pushed around in the run game and they didn’t bring enough consistent pressure. Muhammad Wilkerson’s name was finally heard, unfortunately it was for two personal fouls. The absence of Kony Ealy was very evident.
– Credit to both Lachlan Edwards and Chandler Cantazaro. With offense doing nothing Edwards kept CLE backed up with his punts. And Cantazaro shockingly gave the team a lead at halftime with a massive 57 yard FG.
– Solid game for Josh McCown as he kept the mistakes to a minimum (1 INT) as he was under pressure. And when he had the opportunity to put points on the board he threw two sweet TD’s to Austin Seferian-Jenkins and Jermaine Kearse. Excellent management of the game late as he made safe decisions and drained the clock.
– Did the injury bug bite Bilal Powell again? He left the game early and never returned. With Matt Forte out this was his time to finally take the #1 spot, now is not the time to miss games.
– For the first time Marcus Maye out shined Jamal Adams. Maye was excellent in coverage, run support and had his first INT. Adams struggled missing a key 3rd down tackle and gave up a TD to Njoku.
– Morris Claiborne had an excellent game with multiple PBU’s and an INT that jump started the offense. Marcus Williams was picked on all day and gave up multiple catches to very pedestrian WR’s. The absence of Darryl Roberts and Juston Burris hurt.
– Half credit to Darron Lee & Demario Davis as they both had multiple “splash” plays. Lee had a couple of TFL’s which highlighted his speed and Davis had a sack and brought good “A Gap” pressure on Claiborne’s INT. But they were not consistent in filling their lanes in run defense.
Let’s go over the multiple key plays that allowed the Jets to win:
– Freddie Bishop fumble recovery which cost CLE a TD
– Marcus Maye INT which cost CLE a TD
– Two missed FG’s
– CLE bypassing another FG to go for it on 4th down. Not getting it AND wasting a timeout
– The 96 yard TD drive after CLE didn’t get the 4th down play. Key catches by Eric Tomlinson,
Jeremy Kerley and Jermaine Kearse
– Morris Claiborne INT which set up a TD
– The 57 yard FG by Chandler Cantazaro at halftime
In closing it wasn’t pretty but the Jets will be playing for first place next Sunday. Who would’ve thought that? Also for those who were rating the Jets 2-2 record, JAX destroyed PIT 30-9 and MIA beat TEN. Just saying.

3120,Mexico City 'bike mayor' says two wheels can overtake gridlock grind,"MEXICO CITY (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Zipping through streets teeming with people and traffic after the earthquake that rocked Mexico City last month, cyclists helped locate collapsed buildings where people might be trapped, and ferried tools and supplies to rescue teams.
In the days after the Sept. 19 disaster, over 1,000 cyclists linked up to deliver medical equipment, tarpaulins and food around the city. Areli Carreón, the city’s unofficial “bicycle mayor”, used maps of quake damage as one way of directing riders communicating via walkie-talkie style apps.
“In the first few hours, the only thing that was moving around was bicycles. They really served as an emergency breathing system for the city,” said Carreón.
“No matter the distance, no matter the place, no matter how bad the road was, how difficult the traffic, bicycles with their cargo were the fastest possible way,” she added.
Set up by Amsterdam-based advocacy group CycleSpace, the international “bicycle mayor” scheme Carreón is part of wants its representatives to help coordinate city resources better and work with authorities and businesses to make cycling safer and more accessible.
Setting a target for 50 percent of all urban trips to be made on bicycles by 2030, it has so far designated seven voluntary “mayors” in cities, including Rio de Janeiro, Amsterdam, Sydney and Baroda in India.
“We really believe you can make cities livable again by integrating bikes,” said Anna Luten, Amsterdam’s “bike mayor”, adding that Buenos Aires, Bogotá and El Paso in Texas are also interested. “If you have 20 percent or 10 percent less cars, (drivers) will have a smoother ride as well.”
RISKY ROADS
Along the shaded bike lanes lining the broad Paseo de la Reforma boulevard that carves through Mexico City, cycling is a relative breeze - save for cars parking in the middle of the paths, said Carreón, negotiating the traffic sweeping around the statue of Aztec ruler Cuauhtémoc.
But once the protected lanes end, cycling in the city centre is not for the faint-hearted as bikes are forced to dodge cars and the endless stream of mini-buses that slam into the curb without warning to drop passengers on the cobbled streets around the main Zócalo square.
“It’s definitely a little gritty. A bus comes along and you can literally feel it,” said Alex Villalba, who runs bike maintenance workshops in the city, home to over 21 million people in its greater metropolitan area. “There’s holes everywhere - you’ve got to be ready. If I‘m not in the mood to be hyper-alert, I’ll just take the metro.”
An average of 26 reported cyclist deaths each year is an underestimate, believes Carreón, who helped set up a local cycling campaign group.
White-painted “ghost bikes” marking the spots where cyclists have been killed are a focal point for people to leave flowers and photos of the victims, said the environmentalist.
“It’s our way of honoring the people who died but also to demand the government provide safety for cyclists,” she explained outside a bike workshop in a rundown former monastery in the city centre.
Cutting cyclist deaths and doubling the amount of bike lanes to 340 km (211 miles) are among her main targets. She also wants to double the number of daily bike trips to 280,000 by 2019 in the city ranked by TomTom as the world’s most congested.
“Resources are not actually the problem - it’s putting those resources where they are needed, very strategically, to make this system work,” Carreón said. The mayors must raise funds from local companies and other organizations for their projects.
SAVING TIME AND MONEY
Cycling is already embedded in the fabric of Mexico City, which shuts off miles of streets at weekends to make way for thousands of cyclists. Its ECOBICI bike-sharing scheme, which offered bikes for free after the earthquake, has 250,000 users who can take a spin on more than 6,000 bicycles available at about 450 stands.
But while city hipsters might easily hop on two wheels to get to work, the biggest challenge is to make cycling easier for those living on the poorly connected city fringes, said Carreón.
“Rich people can move around very quickly while poor people can spend four hours of their day just getting to work and back,” she said, highlighting the health benefits of cycling for Mexicans, more than 70 percent of whom are overweight or obese.
She estimates cyclists notch up 16 km/h in gridlocked traffic versus an average of 13 km/h by cars.
“We need to do this because of congestion - we need to move people around because we’re losing a lot of time and money,” she said.
While strict driving limits and pollution monitoring have improved air quality in Mexico City, taking more cars off the road would further cut contamination in what was the world’s most polluted city some 25 years ago.
Events to publicize the role of Mexico City’s “bike mayor” were postponed after the recent quake, but the disaster may have helped highlight the benefits of urban cycling, said Carreón.
“At the city’s worst moment, we were there and able to provide mobility when nothing else - not even emergency vehicles - was moving around,” she said. “We need to make sure there’s a place for cycling, not only in emergencies but every day for everybody to get everywhere.”",fake

On top of that, there are the ""oohs"" of spectacular battle scenes combined with the ""ahhs"" of some new cute fluffy creatures.

619,Maverick state governor takes aim at Mexican presidency,"FILE PHOTO - Jaime Rodriguez rides on his horse inside his house before the official ceremony of delivery constancy as governor from the State Election Commission (CEE) in Monterrey, June 13, 2015. REUTERS/Daniel Becerril
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The first man in modern Mexican history to win a gubernatorial election as an independent said on Wednesday he aimed to run in the 2018 presidential election, putting pressure on the leading anti-establishment contender, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador.
Jaime Rodriguez ruptured the political status quo by capturing the wealthy northern state of Nuevo Leon by a landslide in 2015 after he broke with President Enrique Pena Nieto’s Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
Rodriguez adds to a fragmented landscape of contenders led by twice presidential runner-up Lopez Obrador, a former Mexico City mayor who has spent years pitching himself as the only solution to ongoing political corruption and chronic inequality.
“I want to give it a try, and I want to show that the people are tired of political parties and the politicians themselves,” Rodriguez, 59, told Mexican broadcaster Radio Formula.
Known as “El Bronco” due to his blunt style, Rodriguez has trailed far behind Lopez Obrador in early opinion polls.
However, his entry into the race could eat away at anti-establishment support for Lopez Obrador, a leftist with nationalist leanings. That, in turn, could help the PRI.
The avid horseman said he planned to register on Saturday and will have four months to gather 866,593 signatures - or one percent of the electorate - in at least 17 regions of Mexico to qualify as an independent ahead of the July 2018 vote.
Voter surveys show all presidential hopefuls struggling to win the backing of as much as one third of the electorate.

In June, the PRI was able to exploit those divisions, winning a tight gubernatorial race in the State of Mexico, the country’s most populous region, with barely a third of the vote.
Leading PRI officials say privately the party hopes to take advantage of that fragmentation again to eke out victory in 2018. However, it is still unclear who will be the party’s candidate. Pena Nieto is barred by law from seeking re-election.
Further crowding the pool of anti-systemic candidates, Senator Armando Rios Piter, an independent former member of the center-left Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD), also registered a run for the presidency on Wednesday.
The PRD was once led by Lopez Obrador, but he turned his back on it to found a new leftist movement in 2014, frequently accusing his former allies as being lackeys of the PRI.
The PRD meanwhile, has decided to forge a “broad front” with the main center-right opposition party, the National Action Party (PAN), to defeat the PRI. Officials from both parties say they could back an independent candidate to lead their bid.
All told, ten independents have so far registered, according to the National Electoral Institute (INE). Three of those contenders failed to meet initial requirements, the INE said.
Lopez Obrador has attacked Rodriguez’s independent credentials, describing him as a tool of the PRI, and helping to fuel an increasingly bitter rivalry between the two.
“According to him (Lopez Obrador), he’s the only good guy in the country,” Rodriguez told Radio Formula. “We’re all devils in the rest of the country, he’s the only saint.”",fake
243,How to Make Money While Playing Video Games Online?,"How to Make Money While Playing Video Games Online?
(Before It's News)
Listen up, the gamers among you! Yes, you’ve heard correctly. You’re definitely not dreaming, as today more than ever, you can make real money while enjoying your favorite pastime – playing video games. This is certainly the dream job! In recent years, video game playing has become more akin to sports betting, as a huge, still not well-known gambling market has opened its doors to gamers across the world. Don’t worry, you don’t need to be a hacker to crack into this social gaming experience. The tendency of online betting sites to diversify and attract those who have never set foot in casinos into gambling has led to this lovely convergence of technology and skill that allows you to challenge others on real money bets. Without being considered gambling, videogame betting offers an incomparable betting experience, as it allows you to bet on your own skills, rather than on luck. Everything is indeed in your hands! It is a perfect opportunity for the pro to make some real cash while building up your skills and maybe use them on other betting sites. Still wondering where to find the best paying video games or how to choose the right betting sites? Here’s how. Legal vs. Illegal Video Game Betting Social gaming for real money is a very controversial issue, as to whether it is really to be considered a form of gambling. This is why you should first start by digging some reliable information about the legality of video game betting where you’re based. American state laws on betting differ from one another in many aspects. In different states, there exist restrictions on different games and in some, on the whole real-money gaming experience. As of 2016, 12 US states don’t allow betting on video games, but practice tournaments and challenges are allowed. These states are Arizona, Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Louisiana, Maryland, Montana, South Carolina, South Dakota and Tennessee. In Quebec, Canada it is also deemed illegal to play video games for real money. Other most common restrictions apply to the age of the players. Earlier this year, the UK Gambling Commission has also condemned many unlicensed websites offering social gaming for real money as illegal. So, do your research first. Find the Best Real Money Videogame Sites Having done a bit of research on the legality of the game-play betting sites, it’s time to dive in straight-head into the sea of online betting options out there. Start by reading trustworthy reviews and consider browsing first the best well-known sites. These betting sites generally offer an enormous entourage of sports wagering options, the most popular being football, basketball and soccer. However, unless you’re playing FIFA, you might not be able to find many other skill-based tournaments. You can be sure that the latest slot sites on the market by slotswebsites.org offer the same quality as the top online casinos. This might seem counterintuitive for many of you, as slots in real life are seen as a passive, luck-based gambling option. This is not the case when wagering online. Online casino sites are now all about innovation to answer the whims of the most pretentious, easily bored gamblers. Slots sites are also a good starting point exactly because they’re not so well-known for their console betting options. To recap, the best betting sites for gamers are those that are trustworthy; have various payment options and offer great bonuses and perks, such as premium memberships, leader boards and mobile integration. Which Type of Video Game Betting to Choose? Videogame wagering is certainly here to stay, as it offers a fun, novel way to make real money from the comfort of your home. Passionate gamers are especially advantaged, as they don’t have to learn the rules of the games from scratch, contrary to traditional casino or sport betting where it’s vital to understand how odds are calculated. The gamers familiar with games such as Counter-Strike, Dota, League of Legends, Call of Duty and FIFA will be relieved to know that these are also the highest-ranking games when it comes to video-game wagering. SlotsWebsites.org also lists other lesser popular console games that can bring you a real profit. Even if you’re an extraordinary player, check out some of these guides before setting off to the betting sites. If you’re serious about making money out of gaming, consider also the following videogame betting options. The eSports League for Pro Gamers E-sport competitive gaming is the most widespread type of gaming for real money and it certainly has the potential to turn gaming into a professional sport of the same merit as football and basketball. In many respects, e-sports are similar to real life sports, with teams, leagues, commentators and coaches living and breathing the games. E-Sports is really for the cream of the crop players, but one can enter by watching the contests and betting, just like in regular sport wagering. Tournaments & Challenge Sites Videogame tournaments offering substantial cash prizes are probably the second most popular hook for gamers, but they’re generally seen as harder for the rookies to score a win, since you’d be competing against gamers of all levels, including the professionals. However, playing is not compulsory, you can easily bet on two-player or multiplayer games for as little as a $1. Once you’ve put up a brave face and decided to give it a go, you can register for free and be matched with another player or challenge your friends and agree on a bet. The results are automatically monitored by the site’s operator, providing a fairer game experience and you can cash out, as soon as you win the game. Tournament betting sites most often support console games compatible with PlayStation, Xbox, Wii, Nintendo and on your computer, so virtually all games you can think of. Skin Betting & In-Game Money Options To evade law restrictions, the online gaming betting industry has now evolved to offer betting on skins or in-game items that can increase the characters’ powers and chances for winning. This gambling innovation is most often associated with Counter-Strike: Global Offensive’s virtual gun market, also known as Valve Corporation’s Community Market, where players around the world sell items to one another on auctions for profit. Due to the spread of unauthorized sites, skin betting is negatively associated with black market dealings and many government authorities recommend against it, as it is deemed unsafe. Gamers continue to explore the option, as they see the opportunity for making easy money from their already won low-value skin. For the curious, our recommendation is to take extra caution and bet only on Valve’s main site. Bear in mind that Valve is making 15% profit of every time you win a new skin on a site, using its API. Pay Attention to Entry Fees, Virtual Currencies & Tokens Knowing the rules of the videogames you choose to play for real money and having developed some amazing skills is certainly not a bullet-proof strategy when wagering your own finances. Some console betting games use tokens that are not convertible to real dollars, other providers prefer to complicate things even further by including virtual currencies such as Bitcoin. To spare you the confusion, stick to more traditional betting sites where you open an account and pay a minimum entry fee, with the option to cash out as soon as your game has finished.

787,HAARP to 'make the sky glow' with radio waves over western Arctic starting Thursday,"For four nights beginning on Thursday night, a scientist in Alaska is attempting to create an artificial aurora that could perhaps be seen as far away as Yukon.
 
The experiment is out of the High-frequency Active Auroral Research Program (HAARP) Observatory at Gakona, Alaska, and is planned for 9:30 p.m.
 
You Thought HAARP has been shut down? Nope!
 
<img src=""http://www.sciechimiche.org/scie_chimiche/images/stories/Haarp/haarp04.jpg"">
 
The experiment is going to take place at 9.30pm, and it comes from the High-frequency Active Aurora Research Program Observatory which is in Gakona in Alaska. An artificial airglow in the sky is going to be created by assistant research professor Chris Fallen at the University of Alaska Fairbanks at the Geophysical Institute.
 
Fallen said that sometimes the artificial airglow is called a radio-enhanced aurora or an artificial aurora. He went on to say that what it means is that radio waves from the ground that are powerful can make a glow in the sky. Fallen is going to look into which of the transmissions he makes produce the brightest artificial aurora. He said that the reason why some radio wave transmission causes a glow in the upper atmosphere that is the same colors as the natural aurora is something that is not well understood at the moment.
 
What HAARP Is... And Everything Its Used For
 
 
The knowledge that comes from the experiment of Fallen might also help scientists to gather a better understanding of natural auroras. Fallen went on to say that the experiment should provide them with information on the communications between Earth and satellite and how they are affected by the ionosphere. Fallen believes that this is something that would be very important for navigation uses.
 
The residents of Dawson City in Yukon and Whitehorse should get a good chance to take photographs providing the conditions are clear. Fallen said to the North the best chance of being able to spot the artificial aurora is by taking photographs as the glow from it might be too low for just the naked eye to pick up. Of course, the weather plays a big part in how successful the experiment is going to be. Fallen said that in the past observation has been hampered thanks to clouds and said that if the weather is not in his favor this time, he will postpone.
 
<img src=""http://images6.fanpop.com/image/photos/36200000/Space-image-space-36270547-500-329.jpg"">
 
He went on to say that the experiment is expensive to conduct as while in operation the facility goes through around 600 gallons of diesel every hour. Along with taking photographs, Fallen said that anyone with a shortwave radio would be able to hear the radio frequency that actually creates the aurora. It was said to be a sound much like that of a fax machine.

The agreement, which includes the Jaish al-Islam rebel faction, went into effect at midday on Thursday (1000 GMT), Egyptian state television said.
“We announced a preliminary agreement over the will to enter into a ceasefire and de-escalation deal for the area,” Jaish al-Islam political leader Mohammad Alloush said in televised comments. Details would be worked out in the near future, he said.
The announcement did not name the exact area or towns covered by the ceasefire, and did not mention the Syrian government. There was no immediate comment from Damascus.
Rebel factions hold a small pocket of territory south of Damascus, bordered to the west by an Islamic State enclave and surrounded from the other sides by Syrian troops and allied forces.
Backed by Russia, Iran and Shi‘ite militias, the Syrian government has pushed back rebels over the past year, shoring up its rule over the main urban centers.
Through a series of military offensives and evacuation deals, the government has snuffed out several opposition pockets around the Syrian capital of Damascus.
Thousands of rebels and civilians have poured into the insurgent-held Idlib province in northwest Syria, transferred out of towns and cities that the Syrian army retook.
In recent months, a string of ceasefire deals has eased some of the fighting between government forces and rebels in western Syria, including a truce in the southwest brokered by Russia and the United States.",fake

Many worry about whether or not Trubisky is ready to start, but with the team’s upcoming schedule, it’s actually the smartest and safest time for Trubisky to start. Offensive coordinator Dowell Loggains will bear the responsibility of making sure Trubisky is ready to start against the Vikings. Loggains will look to simplify the playbook so not to overload Trubisky at first and will look to run the ball more as well. Expect running backs Jordan Howard and Tarik Cohen receive a lot of rushing attempts next Monday as a way for the team to limit long passing situations. The advantage for the Bears the next few weeks is that they will not face a lot of great offensive teams that would force the Bears into any shootout situations to where Trubisky would have to pass a lot. The Vikings have been without starting quarterback Sam Bradford and have had backup Case Keenum start since Week 2. To make matters worse, the team lost rookie running back Dalvin Cook for the rest of the season after he tore his ACL this past week against the Detroit Lions. The Vikings offense only scored one touchdown last week and have been inconsistent as they scored 34 points against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers two week ago. Going into the game, if the Bears defense is able to continue their strong play at home and the offense is able to run the ball, Trubisky will not be forced not to have to go out and win the game. Short passes and no turnovers should be all that’s asked of Trubisky when on offense. Following next Monday night’s game, the team will be on the road to take on the Baltimore Ravens on October 15th. The Ravens got off to a great start winning their first two games, but have lost their last two games as they have only been able to score just 16 points total on offense. Their defense has struggled as well giving up a combined 73 points in their last two games. This bolds well for the Bears again as they will be able to rely on defense and the running game to allow Trubisky to be a caretaker at the quarterback position. The last two teams the Bears will face at the end of October will be the Carolina Panthers at home on October 22nd and the New Orleans Saints on the road the following week. These will be a little trickier for the Bears to protect Trubisky from having to pass as these two team have good offenses. The Panthers were able to score 33 points on the road this past week against the defending Super Bowl champion New England Patriots. The Saints since week two have averaged 24 points per game and surprisingly their defense has improved limiting their last two opponents to just 13 points total. After the Saints game, the team will have their bye before hosting the Lions at home on November 12th. The Bears goal should be to make the game as easy as possible for Trubisky in those first four games. Once they are able to get to the bye week, they can further evaluate Trubiksy’s strengths and possibly use the two weeks to prep him to take on more of the playbook. The team wanted their young quarterback to sit as long as possible, but due to lack of production at the position, he is now forced to play and thankfully the timing works well for everyone.

3728,Motor racing: Hamilton's fourth title more a question of when and where,"Formula One F1 - Japanese Grand Prix 2017 - Suzuka Circuit, Japan - October 8, 2017. Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton of Britain gestures as he celebrates winning the race. REUTERS/Toru Hanai
SUZUKA, Japan (Reuters) - The question of whether Lewis Hamilton will win his fourth Formula One world championship this year now looks more a matter of when and where after his Japanese Grand Prix triumph on Sunday.
Fifty nine points clear of Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel with four races remaining, the Mercedes driver can wrap things up at the next race in Austin, Texas, in two weeks if everything goes to plan.
Anything can happen in Formula One, but it will take a monumental collapse for the 32-year-old Briton to be overhauled by a rival whose challenge has imploded.
Vettel knows the score, even if he has not given up hope entirely.
“I don’t need to be a genius or a mathematician,” he said when asked about his chances.
And yet Hamilton and Mercedes, a whopping 145 points clear of Ferrari in their constructors’ battle, will still cling to their mantra of one race at a time and no chickens counted until they hatch.
“There’s no change in approach,” Mercedes boss Toto Wolff said on Sunday.
”We’ve benefited from Ferrari’s misfortune and reliability woes in the last three races, but it doesn’t mean that we are clapping ourselves on the back. On the contrary, I think we need to continue to push.
“You can see how quickly it goes with Sebastian.”

Vettel had lined up in Suzuka on the front row alongside Hamilton but a humble spark plug, one of the cheapest components on a car packed with hi-tech wizardry, stopped his challenge after four laps.
Engine failure in qualifying in Malaysia and a first-corner collision in Singapore put paid to any hopes of victory in those races.
If Hamilton wins in Austin and the German fails to finish higher than sixth, it is game over. Mexico follows a week later and then Brazil with the chances of a decider in Abu Dhabi looking minimal.
Sunday’s twist took the sting out of what was, until the August break, a close fight between four-times champion Vettel and triple titleholder Hamilton.
And then Formula One went on holiday and everything changed.
In the five races since the break, Hamilton has won four times and taken 118 points compared to a mere 45 for Vettel. The German had led his rival by 14 points after Hungary at the end of July.
In the last four races alone, Vettel has given away 66 points to Hamilton.
The Briton, who has finished his last 21 races in the points, said he could only have dreamed of holding such an advantage and credited his team for their efforts.
“They’ve done a phenomenal job, reliability has really been on point,” he said.

751,Boy Scouts move to accept girls prompts backlash,"Image copyright Getty Images
The Boy Scouts of America have announced plans to admit girls into the century-old youth club, allowing them to achieve the same high rank as boys.
The historic decision was agreed upon unanimously by the group's board of directors on Wednesday, triggering a fierce backlash online.
Under the new rules, girls can join the Cub Scouts at a young age, and eventually graduate as Eagle Scouts.
The Girl Scouts of the USA are among critics of the move.
Boy Scouts of America (BSA) chief executive Michael Surbaugh said in a statement: ""We believe it is critical to evolve how our programmes meet the needs of families interested in positive and lifelong experiences for their children.""
""Families today are busier and more diverse than ever,"" the BSA statement continued. ""Most are dual-earners and there are more single-parent households than ever before, making convenient programmes that serve the whole family more appealing.""
The decision was announced on the United Nations' International Day of the Girl, which has been observed since 2012 and is intended to highlight issues facing women and girls.
The move was swiftly disparaged by some social media users, including the eldest son of US President Donald Trump.

Each chapter will be able to determine if they want to remain exclusive to boys, create all-female groups or establish new mixed-sex ""packs"".
Over the summer, Girl Scout president Kathy Hopinkah Hannah wrote an open letter to Boy Scouts officials accusing them of a ""covert campaign"" to recruit girls into the organisation, which she said is confronting ""well-documented"" declining membership.

9,Talks on sale of Air Berlin planes to easyJet at risk of collapse: report,"FILE PHOTO - An Air Berlin sign is seen at an Air Berlin storage hall in Berlin, Germany, August 15, 2017. REUTERS/Axel Schmidt/File Photo
BERLIN (Reuters) - Talks between the insolvent carrier Air Berlin (AB1.DE) and easyJet (EZJ.L) over the sale of up to 30 planes are at risk of falling apart, according to a report in Germany’s B.Z. newspaper on Monday.
The report, citing unnamed Air Berlin sources, said easyJet had reduced its offer of around 50 million euros ($58.69 million) for the planes.
Further complicating matters, there is disagreement over landing rights in Duesseldorf and Berlin’s Tegel airport with Lufthansa (LHAG.DE), which is bidding for other parts of Air Berlin, the report said.
Air Berlin and easyJet declined to comment.
If negotiations between the German and British carriers end with no deal, a new deal with alternative partners must be reached by the end of October because Air Berlin’s funding will dry up, the report said.
Air Berlin, which has around 8,000 employees, filed for insolvency in August after major shareholder Etihad said it would stop providing funding.
The carrier has been in talks with Lufthansa and easyJet on a carve-up of its assets such as aircraft, take-off and landing slots and crew. These talks are due to run until Oct. 12.

2542,The war of words between former and current Mrs Trumps,"Image copyright Getty Images
Donald Trump's first wife, Ivana, has started a war of words by saying she, not Melania, is the real First Lady and by revealing that she has a direct line to the White House but uses it less than she could to avoid jealousy.
Melania is Mr Trump's third wife, and although this is the first time she and Ivana have crossed swords in public, the first wife has certainly had harsh words for her successor, Marla, before.
All three of them were at Mr Trump's inauguration as president in January.
Here are the stories of the three women and their marriages to Donald Trump.
Wife One
Ivana Trump (maiden name: Zelnícková)
Married to Donald 1977-1992
Image copyright Getty Images
Born in 1949 in Czechoslovakia, Ivana met Donald at a bar in New York and the pair were married for 15 years. She is the mother of three of his children: Donald Jr, Ivanka, and Eric.
The couple divorced after rumours surfaced that he was having an affair and he refused to tell Playboy magazine in an interview whether his marriage was monogamous.
During a divorce deposition, Ivana accused Mr Trump of raping her, but she later withdrew the comment, saying her words should not be ""interpreted in a literal or criminal sense"" and she meant instead that she had felt a lack of tenderness. He has said the episode was completely falsified.
The divorce is thought to have cost Mr Trump tens of millions of dollars. Ivana's attempts to receive more money than had been laid out in a pre-nuptial agreement were extensively reported in the New York press at the time.
She even had a cameo in the 1996 film First Wives Club where she repeated the line: ""Don't get mad, get everything!""
She has married twice since, and has remained close enough to Mr Trump to be photographed next to him at functions (as above).
He went on to marry the mistress, Marla Maples.
On becoming president, Mr Trump reportedly offered Ivana the chance to be the US ambassador to the Czech Republic but she declined, preferring to be able to summer in St Tropez.
""I'm known by the name Ivana. I really did not need the name Trump,"" she told the New York Post.
The first Mrs Trump is promoting her book Raising Trump, to be released on Tuesday. In the course of it, she quipped that she is the real first lady.
Melania responded with a statement including the lines: ""There is clearly no substance to this statement from an ex. Unfortunately only attention seeking and self-serving noise.""
Wife Two
Marla Maples (never changed her name)
Married to Donald 1993-1999
Image copyright Getty Images
Marla Maples was born into a Baptist family in Georgia in the US in 1963, making her 14 years younger than Ivana. The couple had one daughter, Tiffany.
Their relationship began in secret, as an affair that lasted for years. Before it, she had been a beauty queen who took a bit part in a Stephen King film (Maximum Overdrive) and posed for a Delta Air Lines ad.
Vanity Fair reported that Marla lived on Mr Trump's mega yacht, Trump Princess and avoided the press. But she would soon come to the world's attention, when she and the Trumps holidayed in the same town.
""I'm Marla and I love your husband. Do you?"" are the words she reportedly said to Ivana when confronting her in Aspen in 1990.
""Stay away from him! Stay away from us!"" Ivana reportedly replied.
Looking back on their divorce, Ms Maples has said she wanted to change Mr Trump but realised after some years that they were not bringing out the best in each other.
In 1990, Marla said: ""I'm, like, of the soil, of the country, of a solid, firm belief in God. I would be happier living out on a farm away from everyone."" After the divorce she moved to California.
Last year when Marla competed in Dancing with the Stars she was eliminated quickly, and Ivana said she was ""never happier in her life"".
Ivana took another swipe at her during book promotion interviews this week, by telling CBS Sunday Morning that Ms Maples was ""a showgirl"" who had never achieved anything - but she has not responded.
Wife Three
Melania Trump (nee Knavs)
Married to Donald 2005 - present
Image copyright Getty Images
Born as Melanija Knavs in Slovenia in 1970, Melania is seven years younger than Marla, 21 years younger than Ivana and 24 years younger than her husband, Donald.
She later changed the spelling of her first name to Melania, and moved to the US in the 1990s.
She married Mr Trump in 2005 after meeting him when she was working as a model. He was reportedly intrigued when she refused to give him her number, asking for his instead.
She is the mother of Barron, 11, and delayed their move to the White House so as not to interrupt his school year.
She is an unusual First Lady in another way: she is the first to have posed nude for a magazine.
When she found herself attacked in public by the first Mrs Trump, her scathing statement managed to take some moral high ground: ""Mrs Trump has made the White House a home for [their son] Barron and The President.
""She loves living in Washington, DC and is honoured by her role as First Lady of the United States.
""She plans to use her title and role to help children, not sell books.""",fake

The Minnesota Vikings suffered a heartbreaking loss to a division rival the Detroit Lions. Their defeat, a 14-7 loss on Sunday at U.S. Bank Stadium, might have come with some deadly consequences. The Vikings star rookie running back, Dalvin Cook who was drafted in the 2nd round of the 2017 NFL draft, went down early in the second half with a knee injury. He did not need crutches when he returned to the bench at the end of the game, but it’s become clear that nothing else that happened on Sunday afternoon at U.S. Bank Stadium could have as much effect on the Vikings’ season as Dalvin Cook’s health. As reported by the Star Tribune, His injury sent Vikings fans home in a sour mood, on a day where they’d spent plenty of time excoriating referees for a lack of calls against Lions defensive backs. The Vikings fear Cook suffered an injury to his left anterior cruciate ligament, according to head coach Mike Zimmer. “We’re concerned about his ACL but he’s going to get an MRI in the morning and we’ll find out,” Zimmer said, adding: “If you lose a guy like him, you lose a lot of firepower.” The loss, dropped the …

3003,"For Dignity and Development, East Africa Curbs Used Clothes Imports","KIGALI, Rwanda — In Kenya, they are called the “clothes of dead white people.” In Mozambique, they are the “clothing of calamity.”
They are nicknames for the unwanted, used clothing from the West that so often ends up in Africa.
Now, a handful of countries here in East Africa no longer want the foreign hand-me-downs dumped on them because they’re trying to manufacture their own clothes.
But they say they’re being punished for it — by the United States.
Here in East Africa, Rwanda, Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, South Sudan and Burundi have been trying to phase out imports of secondhand clothing and shoes over the last year, saying the influx of old items undermines their efforts to build domestic textile industries. The countries want to impose an outright ban by 2019.

2106,Organization May Be Forced to Return Paid Patriotism Funds Again,"By Aaron Kesel
Amid the kneeling protest during the national anthem, the NFL may be forced to return taxpayers’ funds. Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.) on Tuesday called for an end to all federal government support of the NFL.
“I believe we ought to terminate all federal government support of the NFL,” Brooks told Breitbart News.
“That would include the termination of any and all advertising that is done on behalf of the federal government — military and nonmilitary — to the extent we do any.”
“The same thing with any other professional sport that insults our country and our flag and our anthem as the NFL has done,” he added.
The NFL reportedly receives billions of dollars in subsidies from local taxpayers and governments, CNN reported in 2015.
Another 2015 report from NJ.com revealed that more than a dozen NFL teams received money from the Defense Department between 2011 and 2014 in exchange for promoting the military during games and other forms of advertisement.
From 2011-2014, the Department of Defense spent $5.4 million in contracts with 14 NFL teams for flag ceremonies. Even the U.S. National Guard got in on the action and gave $6.7 million to the NFL from 2013 to 2015.
The protest started last year as a way to highlight the racial inequality in America and fight back against police brutality.
This isn’t the first time the organization would be forced to return funds for “paid patriotism.”
In 2016 the professional football league was forced to agree to return $723,734 that it was paid by the Defense Department to honor the military. In a letter to the two Arizona senators, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said an audit uncovered that over the course of four seasons $723,734 “may have been mistakenly applied to appreciation activities rather than recruitment efforts.”
McCain and Flake, who released a letter demanding the NFL pay back taxpayers’ funds previously issued a report in November of that year criticizing the NFL and other pro sports organizations for taking taxpayers’ money to put on events at games honoring the troops, a practice they called “paid patriotism.” That report found that the Pentagon had “inappropriately” paid up to $6.8 million to both professional and college sports teams, CBS reported.
The total paid out for patriotic displays at sporting events was a much more outrageous $53 million in spending on marketing and advertising contracts, SB Nation reported.
Flake was pleased with the NFL’s response returning the money which he called “egregious federal spending.”
“In all the years I’ve spent rooting out egregious federal spending, the NFL is the first organization to perform due diligence, take responsibility and return funds to the taxpayers,” Flake said. “The NFL’s response to this investigation sets a new standard and only strengthens its reputation as a supporter of military service members and veterans.”
McCain equally praised the NFL for giving back taxpayers’ funds tweeting that he applauded the effort.
I applaud @NFL for returning American tax dollars used to honor our troops – time for other leagues to do the same. https://t.co/vLEBOy2qno — John McCain (@SenJohnMcCain) May 19, 2016
According to the report by McCain and Flake, this practice was supposed to be addressed with the NDAA in 2016.
We successfully had the 2016 NDAA [National Defense Authorization Act] amended to restrict the DoD’s spending on paid patriotism in its professional sports advertising contracts.
So this raises a question about what other federal funding from taxpayers the NFL is receiving besides money from the Pentagon for patriotic displays? Which again, are supposed to be discontinued as mandated by law.
Before 2009 NFL players didn’t even stand for the National Anthem; it was a marketing strategy to push military recruitment.
But then the Department of Defense and the National Guard got involved. They began to pay the NFL millions of dollars to have flag ceremonies before games and have players on the field.
ESPN’s Stephen A. Smith covered this issue on ESPN’s First Take in 2016, when players first began the recent on-field protest trend:
As part of the new relationship between the DOD and the National Guard, the NFL changed its practices and began bringing players onfield during the playing of the national anthem for some “inspiring” displays of heartfelt patriotism. The outrage over yesterday’s widespread refusal to continue the practice is proof positive that the DOD’s marketing dollars hit their mark. “Patriots” who never noticed the change in 2009 have been suddenly driven into a frenzy over players’ refusal to continue being used as props in the NFL’s high-priced performance of “America.”
Even paid Senate Armed Services committee war porn poster boy leader John McCain has admitted the practice is wrong.
Given the immense sacrifices made by our service members, it seems more appropriate that any organization with a genuine interest in honoring them, and deriving public credit as a result, should do so at its own expense and not at that of the American taxpayer. Americans deserve the ability to assume that tributes for our men and women in military uniform are genuine displays of national pride, which many are, rather than taxpayer-funded DOD marketing gimmicks. (Source)
In 2015, Senator McCain and the Senate Oversight Committee issued a statement along with a corresponding report condemning the practice of “paid patriotism,” as charades, “conducted not out of a sense of patriotism,” but rather done “for profit in the form of millions in taxpayer dollars going from the Department of Defense to wealthy pro sports franchises.”
The report continued to detail its findings:
Unfortunately, contrary to the public statements made by DOD and the NFL, the majority of the contracts—72 of the 122 contracts we analyzed—clearly show that DOD paid for patriotic tributes at professional football, baseball, basketball, hockey, and soccer games.v These paid tributes included on-field color guard, enlistment and reenlistment ceremonies, performances of the national anthem, full-field flag details, ceremonial first pitches and puck drops. The National Guard paid teams for the “opportunity” to sponsor military appreciation nights and to recognize its birthday. It paid the Buffalo Bills to sponsor its Salute to the Service game.vi DOD even paid teams for the “opportunity” to perform surprise welcome home promotions for troops returning from deployments and to recognize wounded warriors.
NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy later confirmed that players did not appear on field for the anthem until 2009.
This controversial topic was briefly discussed on MSNBC this week, when NFL player Marvin Washington mentioned the financial relationship between the DOD and the NFL. Civil rights activist Jesse Williams also expressed the paid patriotism in an MSNBC interview this week, calling the national anthem a “scam.”
“This is not actually part of football. This was invented in 2009 from the government paying the NFL to market military recruitment to get more people to go off and fight wars to die,” Williams said. “This has nothing to do with [the] NFL, or American pastime, or tradition. … This is to get boys and girls to go fly overseas and go kill people. They’re marketing. They’re pumping millions and millions of dollars into the NFL to get us to put on a pageant in front of the NFL football games to get you to go off and fight.”

(Before It's News)
Quite the Bucco jump out of the gates against Gio Gonzalez. A leadoff single, followed two outs later by a couple of walks, a HBP (on the foot) for a RBI, a bases-clearing double by Mad Max and a Jacob Stallings knock made it 5-0 for Steven Brault before he pushed off the slab. Then again, maybe it’s one of those days as the Nats started with a two-bagger and walk, a double steal and an Anthony Rendon homer. Then Brault struck out the side. In the second, the Bucs got a couple of runners on but a J-Bell GIDP ended the frame; the Nats for their part left the bases loaded. The Pirates went quietly in the third, but not so Washington, which had the first four runners reach to cut the lead to one. Then Angel Sanchez was waved in and shut the door in a nice bit of work. The fourth went by without a run.
Mad Max had a good couple of days in DC (photo Joe Guzy/Pirates)
In the fifth, a Cutch double (S-Rod ran for him; apparently Andrew’s sore foot ached) followed by J-Bell & Freeser knocks plated a run before another DP, this one served by Joe Blanton v J-Lup, ended the frame. Johnny Barbato took the ball and walked a pair after an out, bringing in Jack Leathersich. A single packed the sacks but a whiff and a bouncer into the shift by Bryce Harper prevented any damage. Tanner Roark took over in the sixth and the bats continued to boom – a walk came around on Stallings double and Jake rumbled home after another single and groundout. Edgar Santana climbed the hill and stranded an infield knock and walk. Austin Adams got the wave for the Nats in the seventh and zinged the Bucs. Dovydas Neverauskas answered the phone and tossed BP again, giving up a homer, single and double as Washington pared the score to 8-6.
In the eighth, Ollie Perez gave up four singles good for two runs, bopped a guy to load ‘em and then walked in another tally. Matt Alber came on and gave up a Baltimore chop rap to J-Stalls (no one covered first, oops) before shutting the gate. Daniel Hudson came in for Pittsburgh and loaded the bases with an out, but got a timely DP to keep it 11-6. The Bucs went down 1-2-3 in the ninth and Dan Runzler tried to close it out, but Joey O dropped a fly ball and then J-Bell mishandled a roller and suddenly it was 11-8. George Kontos did put it away, getting a four-pitch whiff for his first save of the year.
Jake was swingin’ it too (photo Dave Arrigo/Pirates)
The game took four hours and 22 minutes, the longest nine-inning outing in history for both clubs. The Pirates used 23 players, including nine pitchers. The Bucs stranded 10 runners, the Nats 15; each club issued seven free passes. Pretty it wasn’t, but it beats the alternative. Nothin’ like a “Raise It” to close the campaign.
Notes:
Jake Stallings had three hits & a walk while Max Moroff had a knock and two walks; together they drove in seven runs and scored three. Chris Bostick & J-Bell had two hits and a walk, and Starling had two more raps to end the year on a 12-game hitting streak.
Steven Brault had a pretty miserable closing day: two IP, four runs, six hits, four walks and four Ks after 68 pitches.
On his last Sunday show of the season, GM Neal Huntington wouldn’t commit to Cutch’s return, but did say he’d be in center if he’s back. He added he hopes to have the same crew of big league coaches in the fold for 2018.

One win doesn’t change the fact that the team is still rebuilding and trying to build a young core going forward. But through the first three games there are some trends that bear watching:
– The offensive staff has shown an ability to adjust on the fly to get the offense stabilized. Whether it’s been using 6-7 OLinemen to establish the run or TE & FB to chip pass rushers.
– The OLine (all 28 and under) has been very good in pass protection and improving in run blocking. And the fact that the staff has mixed and matched them in various aliments shows we may actually have depth.
– The TE position could actually be a big time strength with Seferian-Jenkins, Tye and Leggett (once healthy). The inline blocking of the position has surprised me.
– The acquisition of Kearse the continued development of Anderson and the flashes Stewart show give me hope for a nice corps of WR. But the staff MUST use Stewart & Hansen more, if we have those four and a healthy Enunwa next year we may have something.
– Forte looks slower than last year, Powell and McGuire need to be the primary RB’s going forward.
– Will the defense continue to stay true to their assignments? They absolutely detroyed MIA who has a lot of weapons and a good OLine just by doing their jobs. Can they keep it up? Because it’s amazing how good our ILB’s looked once everyone maintained their gaps and tackled. It’s also crucial because a sound defense allows Adams to be used all over the field as highlighted in Cimini’s article.

2289,NFL owners to mull anthem rules as Trump ups protest criticism,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - NFL team owners will consider requiring football players to stand for the U.S. national anthem after President Donald Trump on Tuesday suggested using tax laws to penalize the league for players who kneel in protest of racial injustice.
Trump, a Republican, escalated his feud with the National Football League in a Twitter post asking if the league should get tax breaks while some athletes kneel in protest when the “Star-Spangled Banner” is played at the start of each game.
“Why is the NFL getting massive tax breaks while at the same time disrespecting our Anthem, Flag and Country? Change tax law!” Trump wrote on Twitter.
The world’s top-grossing sports league gave up its tax-free status two years ago. Its owners are preparing to address the anthem issue at their fall meeting in New York Oct. 17-18, NFL chief spokesman Joe Lockhart told reporters on a conference call on Tuesday.
“Everyone at this point is frustrated by the situation,” Lockhart said. “The commissioner and the owners do want the players to stand. We think it is an important part of the game.”
The protests, in a league where African-Americans make up the majority of players, have continued through the season, with some players taking a knee when the anthem is played and others standing arm-in-arm in solidarity.
Current policy calls for players to stand for the anthem and face the flag, but no player has been disciplined for a protest, Lockhart said.

“We need to move past this controversy, and we want to do that together with our players,” NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell wrote in a memo to team owners.
The White House supported the idea of asking players to stand, said spokeswoman Sarah Sanders.
“We are glad to see the NFL taking positive steps in that direction,” she said at a news briefing.

Asked to explain Trump’s comment on the NFL and taxes, Sanders said, “The federal tax law doesn’t apply here, but certainly we know that they receive tax subsidies on a variety of different levels.”
The NFL Players Association, when asked for a reaction to possible changes to anthem rules, said in an email “we do not have a response at this time.”
Trump last month called on NFL team owners to fire players who kneel during the anthem to protest police violence against black Americans.
Critics contend Trump is fanning the controversy to distract from issues including devastation in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria, tensions with North Korea and difficulties in pushing healthcare and tax overhauls through the U.S. Congress.

Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, speaking on KRLD-FM in Dallas on Tuesday, reiterated his stance that if any of his players chose to demonstrate during the anthem, they would not play.
“If you do not honor and stand for the flag in the way that a lot of our fans feel that you should ... if that’s not the case, then you won’t play,” said Jones.
“That’s nothing new as far as that being my wish or the way I want the Cowboys. As far as whether or not I will basically institute or do what I said I would just say. ... I would ask anybody to look at my record relative to what I say I’m going to do.”
Vice President Mike Pence walked out of a NFL game on Sunday after some players knelt, an action some critics called a publicity stunt.
Trump won the presidency with less support from black voters than any other president in at least four decades.
Trump has squared off against the NFL before, having owned a team in the upstart United States Football League in the 1980s. That league folded in 1985 after an antitrust lawsuit against the NFL failed.
Trump has refused to disclose his own tax history, departing from a practice of U.S. presidents going back more than 40 years. Trump has said nobody cares about his tax returns, but critics say they could show conflicts of interest.",fake
749,Switch IPO the latest to limit investor voting rights,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - When data center operator Switch Inc goes public on Friday it will be the latest tech firm using special shares to limit the rights of minority investors, making it ineligible for inclusion in the S&P 500 under new rules meant to deter such practices.
The Las Vegas company, run by enigmatic founder and Chief Executive Officer Rob Roy, plans to sell 31.3 million shares in an initial public offer late on Thursday for between $14 and $16 a piece, which would raise nearly $500 million and make it the largest technology listing this year after Snap Inc .
Underwriters closed their order book late on Wednesday and the deal was oversubscribed, according to a source close to the IPO.
Roy, who describes himself as an “inventrepreneur” and “tech futurist,” will have 68 percent of voting power following the IPO, thanks to a special share class providing 10 votes per share.
That will keep Switch out of the S&P 500 and other related indexes under new rules instituted by S&P Dow Jones in July after Snap sold shares without any voting rights in its $3.4 billion IPO earlier this year.
Rule changes enacted last month for FTSE Russell indexes, also in reaction to Snap, require new constituents of its indexes to have at least 5 percent of their voting rights in the hands of public shareholders.
The shares being sold in Switch’s IPO will include 4.9 percent of the company’s voting rights, or 5.6 percent if underwriters exercise an option to buy additional shares.
In its IPO filing and a profile of Roy on the company website, Switch gives no details about what he did before founding the company in 2000 or his academic qualifications. The profile describes him as “a recognized expert in advanced end-to-end solutions for mission-critical facilities.”
A company spokesman declined to provide additional information about Roy, and he does not appear in a 38-minute video marketing the IPO.
The IPO could value Switch, which operates three data centers in Michigan and Nevada, at almost $4 billion.
Snap co-founder Evan Spiegel was well known to Wall Street ahead of the Snapchat-owner’s February share offer, with many investors essentially betting on his talent. With Roy less known, investors may be taking a greater risk on a company in which they will have little say.
“Investors do look at voting control as well as the price you pay. If you put so much stock in the CEO, normally he’s going to part of the sales pitch for the company,” said Ken Bertsch, Executive Director of the Council of Institutional Investors, which represents top U.S. pension funds.
As many of 15 percent of U.S. IPOs in recent years have used dual share classes meant to give insiders outsized voting rights, according to the Council of Institutional Investors.
Inclusion in a stock index can be an important milestone for young companies, bringing their shares into many passive funds and others that closely follow indexes like the S&P 500, a guide for trillions of dollars of capital worldwide.
Other companies excluded from major indexes under their new rules include video-streaming company Roku Inc , whose IPO last week kept 97 percent of voting power with insiders. Software seller Mulesoft Inc’s IPO in February included a share class with 10 votes per share, as did Blue Apron Holdings Inc in its June debut.
Suggesting that the tide may be turning toward sharing power with minority investors, privately-held ride-hailing company Uber on Tuesday said it would abandon a dual share class system that favored insiders including former Chief Executive Travis Kalanick.
Responding to a shareholder lawsuit, Facebook Inc in September gave up plans for a new class of stock that was meant to be a way for Mark Zuckerberg to retain control over the company he founded while fulfilling a pledge to give away his wealth.

3493,Discussing the Rohingya Refugee Crisis,"Ben: It is enormous. It’s really impressive how fast it’s going up. There’s a sliver of land that goes from the north, and this city called Cox’s Bazar, and then you just go south all the way to the end, along the side is this one river that people are crossing over. And as you go south you start to run into thousands and thousands of people on the street — thousands of people just walking.
Photo
How does this compare to other refugee situations you’ve covered?
What’s different is the mentality of Rohingya; they are very used to this kind of devastation. They’re very accustomed to being so oppressed and so beaten down. You never see people cry. You rarely see people get really emotional. People are just very, very honest about where they’re at, and it’s almost more striking in a way. I’ve been to so many places where the suffering is so massive and people really are upset. And here the suffering is just as bad if not worse.
Photo
What about the politics of this? Are there people in the camps talking about any of that?
I think people are just really happy to be here, to be honest.
Something that’s really striking to me — and that’s only because maybe that I’m here and experiencing it — is to look at the way that not only the Myanmar government but also the Myanmar population is reacting to all this, which is basically to deny it.

Damien: What have you made of the response in Myanmar, Hannah, especially from the country’s leader (and Nobel Peace Prize winner), Daw Aung San Suu Kyi?
Hannah: It’s complicated. I think that when she became the de facto leader of the Myanmar government last year, there was this wish from the international community that we would have this feel-good narrative.
In Asia, it’s been a story of the rollback of democracy, and so here was just one story where there was this peaceful transition from a military junta that ruled for almost 50 years to a civilian leader — this democracy activist, this Nobel Peace Prize laureate.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
And the truth of the matter is that she is still very, very constrained, and the military controls a lot of things — and controls the people who are committing what seem to be atrocities in the Rohingya areas in northern Rakhine state and in western Myanmar.
Having said that, she is the Nobel Peace Prize laureate and the one weapon that she has that the military doesn’t have is her moral authority — and she has not used it. And so I think that the international community has every right to call her and say: “Look, you know we understand that your position is very difficult. But if you don’t speak out for these people, then who will?”

You’re a relatively newly installed bureau chief for The Times in Southeast Asia, though you’ve been covering the region for years. What else are you looking at in the region?
The thing about Southeast Asia is it’s 11 countries or so, all of which are very different. And nothing really ties them together except, I would say, maybe two things.
One is the fact that democracy has been seriously challenged throughout the region. You look at Thailand, where I am now, which is now ruled by a military junta. You have Myanmar, which has this kind of quasi-civilian government. You look at Malayasia, where there are allegations of corruption and a rollback of rights, and the Philippines, where you have a leader who has publicly endorsed a fatal drug war. You have Indonesia, which is kind of the shining light of democracy in the region but has serious ethnic and religious issues of its own.
The other issue is a religious change, and it relates to Myanmar as well. There you have this divide between a Buddhist majority nation and a Muslim minority. In Thailand you have the similar thing — you have a country that is about 90 percent Buddhist with, in the south, a Muslim insurgency.
And then you have places like Malaysia and Indonesia, where it’s majority Muslim but there are significant religious minorities chafing against the majority. So you have these kind of religious fault lines throughout the region that I think are something we’re really paying attention to.",fake

3807,The Demise of the Dollar: Don’t Hold Your Breath,"[gard align='center']
By Charles Hugh Smith
The demise of the U.S. dollar has been a staple of the financial media for decades. The latest buzzword making the rounds is de-dollarization, which describes the move away from USD in global payments.
De-dollarization is often equated with the demise of the dollar, but this reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of the currency markets.
Look, I get it: the U.S. dollar arouses emotions because it’s widely seen as one of the more potent tools of U.S. hegemony. Lots of people are hoping for the demise of the dollar, for all sorts of reasons that have nothing to do with the actual flow of currencies or the role of currencies in the global economy and foreign exchange (FX) markets.
So there is a large built-in audience for any claim that the dollar is on its deathbed.
I understand the emotional appeal of this, but investors and traders can’t afford to make decisions on the emotional appeal of superficial claims–not just in the FX markets, but in any markets.
So let’s ground the discussion of the demise of the USD in some basic fundamentals. Now would be a good time to refill your beverage/drip-bag because we’re going to cover some dynamics that require both emotional detachment and focus.
First, forget what currency we’re talking about. If the USD raises your hackles, then substitute quatloos for USD.
There are three basic uses for currency:
1. International payments. This can be thought of as flow: if I buy a load of bat guano and the seller demands payment in quatloos, I convert my USD to quatloos–a process that is essentially real-time–render payment, and I’m done with the FX part of the transaction.
It doesn’t matter what currency I start with or what currency I convert my payment into to satisfy the seller–I only hold that currency long enough to complete the transaction: a matter of seconds.
If sellers demand I use quatloos, pesos, rubles or RMB for those few moments, the only thing that matters is the availability of the currency and the exchange rate in those few moments.
2. Foreign reserves. Nation-states keep reserves for a variety of reasons, one being to support their own currency if imbalances occur that push their currency in unwanted directions.
The only nations that don’t need to hold much in the way of currency reserves are those that issue a reserve currency–a so-called “hard currency” that is stable enough and issued in sufficient size to be worth holding in reserve.
3. Debt. Everybody loves to borrow money. We know this because global debt keeps rising at a phenomenal rate, in every sector: government (public), corporate and household (private sectors). (See chart below.)",credible
1936,11 & US Govt Has Proven They ‘Hate Our Freedom’ Just As Much as Terrorists,"By Matt Agorist
“They hate our freedoms: our freedom of religion, our freedom of speech, our freedom to vote and assemble and disagree with each other.” – George W. Bush addresses the nation on September 20, 2001 — 9 Days after the attacks
Those of us who are old enough to remember a time before 9/11 can recall “the good old days” before the police state was ramped up to the militaristic control grid that it is today.
We remember a time before fear became the only thing that your television fed you. Sure, the propaganda machine and the war machine has existed long before 9/11, but since that fateful day, the fear peddlers and the tyrants have cranked it up a notch – or ten.
Freedom diminishing step one: The TSA
Prior to 9/11, no one heard of the Transportation Security Administration because they didn’t exist. The TSA was created as a reactionary security measure to hijackers sneaking box-cutters onto planes. It has since morphed into a vile organization of total domination, degradation, theft, and molestation.
If you think taking your shoes off at the airport makes you safer, you need to read more history.
Freedom diminishing step two: The NSA
Having worked directly under the NSA for several years prior to the attacks on 9/11, I can tell you that spying on Americans was not only frowned upon by our superiors, but it was a chargeable offense. During my years as an Intelligence Communications Intercept Operator, we were told that if we came across “friendly chatter,” we move on, or we go to jail.
However, since 9/11, the NSA has conducted an about face. The restrictions that kept myself and my team from spying on Americans were lifted. The tentacles of this police state leviathan quickly spread their way into every facet of American life. We wouldn’t find out until several years later that all of our private data has been, and forever will be, subject to the prying eyes of the State.
Freedom diminishing step three: Perpetual War
The attacks on the world trade centers ushered in a new means of the state to spread its empire. A new and vaguely defined ‘enemy’ had been declared and its name was terrorism.
“Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists,” George Bush ironically said immediately after saying the terrorists “hate us…because we can disagree with each other.”
Literally overnight, the entire world was declared an enemy of the United States unless they prostrated themselves and declared their unwavering support for the US empire.
This notion gave birth to the state’s ability to declare a perpetual war. The war on the ‘tactic’ of terrorism would give way to an unlimited expansion of police state powers, and the state knew it. Bush would even state this idea in his speech. Later in the same September 20th speech, Bush would declare that the war “will not end until every terrorist group of global reach has been found, stopped and defeated.” In the same speech, he later said that this war is “a task that does not end.”
Despite both Obama and Bush declaring the wars a success and having ended, nothing could be further from the truth as Trump’s recent plan to re-escalate America’s presence in Afghanistan illustrates. Since 9/11 secret US prisons popped up where unspeakable acts of torture continue to this day. Millions of innocent civilians have been slain and continue to be slain. Countless children have been blown to bits by Americans spreading democracy with Hellfire missiles.
All the while, the average American continues to praise the government for “keeping them free” and unquestioningly continues life as normal.
Freedom diminishing step four: The Militarization of Police
Along with perpetual war comes the perpetual lobbying of defense contractors for bigger and better ways to kill people.
“In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist,” Dwight D. Eisenhower famously said in his 1961 farewell speech. He couldn’t have been more right.
As taxpayer dollars go to buying newer and nicer tools of death, these older tools of death need a new home.
Conveniently enough, the government had a program in place since 1997, which allowed for the old tools of war to come home and be used against the American people. It was called the 1033 program. Even though Obama ended this program in 2015, his champion of the police state successor just turned this program back on, paving the way for the creation of a standing army that our forefathers warned us about.
Within just a few short years, thousands of police departments across the country were issued mine-resistant vehicles, amphibious assault vehicles, grenade launchers, countless high-powered machine guns, and even Apache attack choppers—and now, all that is back.
All of this military gear, we are told, is to keep us safe.
Freedom diminishing step five: The End of Free Speech
As governments throughout history have attempted to spread their empire across the globe, a side effect is the creation of a police state at home. The United States is no exception, and as the police state grows, so does resistance to it.
This resistance becomes a thorn in the side of tyrants and they will do everything in their power to silence it.
Since 9/11, America has entered a Post-Constitutional era of “Free Speech Zones,” riot police with sound cannons blasting down peaceful dissenters, and worse. Now, identity politics are pushed upon the masses through the mainstream media causing violence at protests between the us’s and them’s. Protest violence is playing right into the hands of the police state as it easily allows them to demonize all free-speech.
As the Free Thought Project’s Jay Syrmopoulos points out, if there is one thing that Islamic fundamentalists and Islamophobic fascists agree on, it’s that there should be no “gray zone;” only black and white. The establishment’s identity politics are paving the way for this black and white world.
The gray zone is the zone of peaceful coexistence. Eliminating the gray zone – and rendering a world as black & white as the flag of the Islamic state is the ultimate goal of fundamentalists on all sides.
In fact, a recent ISIS publication, titled Extinction of the Grayzone made clear that the strategy has been at play for the past 14 years.
The grayzone is critically endangered, rather on the brink of extinction. It’s endangerment began with the blessed operation of September 11th, as these operations manifested two camps before the world for mankind to choose between, a camp of Islam… and a camp of kufr – the crusader coalition.
American policy is playing right into the hands of terrorists and the citizens are playing right along.
But all hope is not lost.
Freedom regaining step one: Be the Change
Sadly enough, this counterfeit version of the “Land of the Free” is now the new normal. The next generation’s benchmark for “Freedom” will be journalists being snatched up in the streets, and cops publicly executing citizens and not being charged.
The dystopian future that Americans are now taking part in creating is an ominous reality.
However, to those of us who see the entire picture and remember a time when it wasn’t okay for the blue gloves at the TSA to prod your anus in the name of freedom, we remain resilient.
So, next time your chest begins to fill with patriotic puff, stop for a second and realize that Americans are not free anymore. America is becoming the evil that it once stood against.
In the meantime, however, we still have the freedom in this country to inform ourselves and others. Only through a lesser ignorance will these horrid tyrannical traits subside.
Humanity is involved in a struggle, as we have always been, but there are much more of us now. Inciting peaceful change has never been more important. However, so many well-meaning individuals go about inciting this change with blunt force. As the violence at the recent protests across the country in the last year have shown—this has to change.
If you truly want to make the world a more peaceful place, you have to become a more peaceful person. Petty infighting, personal attacks, vitriol, and hate are the tools of tyrants and also of those who only claim to be awake.
Peace is true professionalism and it is also the means by which effective change is sought.
Be the change that you want to see in this world.

Yet despite Ryan Gosling, a striking visual template and Harrison Ford reprising the role he played in the 1982 sci-fi classic, glitches mar this undeniably ambitious but drawn-out exercise.
Director Denis Villaneuve (""Arrival"") looked like an inspired choice to put a modern spin on this cerebral thriller. And in much the way that HBO's ""Westworld"" brought fresh considerations to Michael Crichton's movie, this 35-years-later sequel introduces ideas and concerns about renegade robots and artificial intelligence that feel very much suited to where we are now.
The movie, however, perhaps tackles too much, incorporating clever callbacks to its cinematic predecessor while seeking to carve out its own expansive narrative. The pacing, too, is somewhat off, with the first two thirds of the film -- which runs 2 hours, 44 minutes -- feeling a tad too leisurely, as if luxuriating in its futuristic dystopia, before rushing toward its slightly messy climactic act.

From that perspective, it's possible to admire ""Blade Runner"" for what it endeavors to do -- and recommend seeing it on that level -- without feeling completely satisfied.
The filmmakers have understandably asked that reviews be as spoiler-free as possible, but the basic outline has been spelled out in the promotional material.

1449,Chicago Blackhawks defeat the salary cap menace,"Chicago Blackhawks defeat the salary cap menace
(Before It's News)
The NHL has made the decision to allow the Chicago Blackhawks to place Marian Hossa on long-term injured reserve. The 12-year contract that Hossa signed with the Blackhawks became a problem when the 2013 CBA attached a salary cap recapture penalty to his contract. The 2013 CBA wanted to punish teams that circumvented the salary cap by signing long deals such as Hossa’s 12-year, $63 million deal. If Hossa retired this year the Blackhawks would be hit with a $4.275 million penalty over the next 4 years. The 2013 CBA essentially backed the Blackhawks into a corner with Hossa and the only realistic way around it is placing him on long-term injured reserve. It turns out Hossa has been dealing with a skin condition that was starting to affect his health and playing ability. Now the Blackhawks can avoid cap recapture penalties by placing Hossa on LTIR. I’ll make it clear that the last thing the Blackhawks want to do is play a full season without Hossa, he’s a player that is near impossible to replace. The only good thing about Hossa hitting LTIR is the Blackhawks will finally be able to escape a suffocating salary cap.
This is how the Blackhawks will become salary cap compliant:
Tootoo and Rozsival will be placed on the season-opening LTIR to bring cap overages down to $0. The Blackhawks will put forth a league minimum, salary cap compliant roster. Hossa will be placed on LTIR and the Blackhawks will free up roughly $3 million in cap space.
Now the Blackhawks will have the flexibility to add Alex DeBrincat and Gustav Forsling back to the roster and sign Cody Franson. Franson’s deal is reported to be 1 year, $1 million. At the expense of Marian Hossa’s career, the Blackhawks will have some cap space to work with. This is a problem that the NHL shouldn’t have let happen and it’s something other teams will have to deal with until the NHL fixes it.

1610,Catalan leader under pressure to drop independence,"BARCELONA/MADRID (Reuters) - Catalonia’s secessionist leader faced increased pressure on Monday to abandon plans to declare independence from Spain, with France and Germany expressing support for the country’s unity.
The Madrid government, grappling with Spain’s biggest political crisis since an attempted military coup in 1981, said it would respond immediately to any such unilateral declaration.
A week after a vote on independence which the government did its utmost to thwart, the tension also took its toll on the business climate of Spain’s wealthiest region.
Three more Catalonia-based companies joined a business exodus from the region that has gathered steam since the Oct. 1 referendum.
Property group Inmobiliaria Colonial (COL.MC) and infrastructure firm Abertis (ABE.MC) both decided to relocate their head offices to Madrid and telecoms firm Cellnex (CLNX.MC) said it would do the same for as long as political uncertainty in Catalonia continued.
Publishing house Grupo Planeta said it would move its registered office from Barcelona to Madrid if the Catalan parliament unilaterally declared independence.
Spain’s finance minister said it was the Catalan government’s fault the companies were leaving.
Regional leader Carles Puigdemont is due to address the regional parliament on Tuesday afternoon and Madrid is worried it will vote for a unilateral declaration of independence.
Catalan officials say people voted overwhelmingly for secession in the Oct. 1 referendum, which had been declared illegal by the government. Some 900 people were injured on polling day when police fired rubber bullets and stormed crowds with truncheons to disrupt the voting.
The issue has deeply divided the northeastern region as well as the Spanish nation. Hundreds of thousands of people demonstrated against breaking away in Barcelona at the weekend. They say the referendum did not show the true will of the region because those who want to stay in Spain mainly boycotted it.
Buoyed by the show of support, Spanish Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaría said on Monday: “I‘m calling on the sensible people in the Catalan government ... don’t jump off the edge because you’ll take the people with you.”
“If there is a unilateral declaration of independence there will be decisions made to restore law and democracy,” she told COPE radio station.
Underlining conflicting pressures on Puigdemont, the small, anti-capitalist Popular Unity Candidacy (CUP) party, which has an outsized influence on his government, said the outcome of the vote must be applied.
“We don’t want to hold up the declaration of the Catalan republic,” CUP lawmaker Benet Salellas told a news conference.
European heavyweights Germany and France weighed in against a split.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel spoke to Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy on Saturday, stressing her support for Spain’s unity but encouraging dialogue, her spokesman said.
France said it would not recognize Catalonia if the region unilaterally declared independence. If secession were recognized it would lead to Catalonia’s automatic exit from the European Union, a French junior minister said.

“This crisis needs to be resolved through dialogue at all levels of Spanish politics,” France’s European affairs minister Nathalie Loiseau said.
The European Union has shown no interest in an independent Catalonia, despite an appeal by Puigdemont for Brussels to mediate in the crisis.
NEW ELECTIONS?
Under Catalonia’s referendum law, deemed unconstitutional by Madrid, a vote for independence in the assembly on Tuesday would start a six-month process envisaging divorce talks with Spain before regional elections and a final act of separation.
Rajoy gained some political cover on Monday for the so-called “nuclear option” of removing Catalonia’s government and calling new regional elections.
Opposition Socialist leader Pedro Sanchez said he would “support the response of the rule of law in the face of any attempt to break social harmony”, but stopped short of explicitly saying his party would back dissolving the regional parliament.

Barcelona Mayor Ada Colau advised Puigdemont against proclaiming independence on the basis of the referendum results and she urged Rajoy to rule out suspending Catalonia’s autonomy.
Losing Catalonia, which has its own language and culture, would deprive Spain of a fifth of its economic output and more than a quarter of exports.
The crisis has reopened old divisions in a nation where the right-wing dictatorship of General Francisco Franco is a living memory easily revived by strong displays of nationalism.
A spokesman for the ruling People’s Party (PP) invoked the memory of former Catalan leader Lluis Companys, who was arrested for declaring independence in 1934 and later executed.
“We hope they don’t declare anything tomorrow, because anyone doing so might end up like him 83 years ago, in prison,” Pablo Casado told a news conference in Madrid.
Many moderate Spaniards, including in Catalonia, oppose a breakaway. Regional authorities say about 90 percent of votes in the referendum were for secession, but turnout was only 43 percent.
Sunday's anti-independence demonstration helped calm financial markets, as did credit rating agencies Moody's and DBRS which said they expected Spain to remain united. Spanish borrowing costs fell to a one-week low and the main share index .IBEX touched a week high.
Puigdemont appeared resolute on Sunday, saying the referendum law called for a declaration of independence in the event of a “yes” vote. “We will apply what the law says,” he told TV3.
Catalonia’s High Court asked for more security, specifically drafting in the national police, who were called in to stop the referendum when the Catalan police force failed to act.
Puigdemont said on Sunday he had not been in contact with the Madrid government for some time because it refused to discuss independence.
“What is happening in Catalonia is real, whether they like it or not. Millions of people have voted, who want to decide. We have to talk about this,” he said.
Rajoy has said repeatedly he will not talk to the Catalan leaders unless they drop their plans to declare independence.",fake
2427,"Marty Baron cuts through Trump noise, stays focused on Washington Post's mission","Marty Baron has learned to tune out President Trump's insults against the press.
""It's almost become like background music to the work that we do every day,"" the Washington Post's executive editor told Brian Stelter this week in a rare TV interview.
But Baron still takes Trump's comments seriously. ""The administration's continuing attack on the press and its effort to undermine our credibility"" is a real danger to newsrooms like the Post, he said.
Trump's moniker for the Post is the ""Amazon Washington Post.""
""It's an absurd thing to say,"" Baron said.""I mean, the fact is we're not owned by Amazon. We're owned by Jeff Bezos, who's the founder of Amazon and he doesn't get involved in our coverage in any way.""
Highlights from the interview with Baron, taped at the Washington Post's headquarters, will air Sunday on Reliable Sources, but you can listen to the full conversation as a podcast here:
Baron, one of the most respected editors in the industry, has led the Boston Globe and the Washington Post to multiple Pulitzer Prizes. His work at the Boston Globe was famously depicted in the Oscar-winning film ""Spotlight"" in 2015.
When he's not contending with President Trump's attacks against the press, Baron is working to prevent a rollback of policies that limit the exposure of reporters in leak investigations by the Department of Justice.
""We would like to see the existing policy maintained,"" said Baron, who attended a meeting this week with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and representatives of the news media on this subject.
Under the guidelines that the Trump administration is looking to revise, Baron explained, if the government wanted to obtain a search warrant, or subpoena records ""from third parties, like telephone companies and internet providers"" in the context of a leak investigation, ""we would receive notification.""
The current guidelines were enacted in 2015, after the Obama administration came under fire for obtaining phone records and email communications from the Associated Press and Fox News, a move many interpreted as an overreach.
Baron reminded Stelter that the relationship between the press and the Obama administration was all but ""warm and cozy.""
""They had more leak investigations involving the press than all previous administrations combined,"" Baron said.
However, when Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced in August that the Trump administration is pursuing a number of leak investigations three times higher than what was left open at the end of Obama's tenure, Baron said he thinks ""that is, in fact, an effort to try to intimidate the press from doing its job.""
It's possible that some Post reporters are ensnared in leak investigations right now, he acknowledged, but the Post wouldn't know it unless there was a subpoena, a search warrant or ""an actual leak about the leak investigation.""
In the interview, Baron said the Trump administration has created ""a very hostile atmosphere"" with the news media.
""The administration has restricted access to certain kinds of information,"" he said, citing the president's tax returns, White House's visitor logs, and various data sets from government agencies.
He indicated that he is troubled by the lack of transparency on several different fronts.
""Things could be better. Let's put it that way,"" he said.
But Baron is not daunted by these obstacles. When asked if the Justice Department's pursuit of leakers sends a ""chilling effect"" through the Post's newsroom, Baron did not hesitate in his response.
""It doesn't have a chilling effect on us right now,"" he said. ""That's for sure, and I don't expect that it will, because we understand what our mission is and we intend to pursue it no matter what.""
The Post recently celebrated a business-side milestone -- one million digital subscribers.
What's the next goal? ""Two million,"" he quipped.
Asked whether the growth is attributable to interest in the Trump presidency, as some analysts have asserted, Baron said ""I can't say that it's totally disconnected,"" but ""I think it's much broader than that.""
People have come to value ""quality journalism,"" he said. ""They want to support quality journalism. They're concerned about the spread of conspiracy theories. They're concern about the spread of falsehoods. They're concerned about that. They've come to value the role of quality news organizations and they want they want to support that. They think it's important and they think that it's essential to a well-functioning democracy and to civil society. And: they're right about that.""",fake

LONDON (Reuters) - Some of Shakespeare’s best known characters - Romeo and Juliet, Hamlet and King Lear - will be featuring along a stretch of the River Thames this weekend, as part of celebrations to mark the 400th anniversary of the death of England’s greatest playwright.
Short films of the Bard’s plays will be screened along the south bank of the river, while in the middle of the 2.5 mile (km) route, the Globe theater will stage a production of Hamlet which returns to London after touring 189 countries in two years.
Dominic Dromgoole, the artistic director of Shakespeare’s Globe theater, said the Hamlet tour, which this month alone has performed in Kabul, Afghanistan, and Elsinore, Denmark, where Shakespeare set the play, demonstrated Shakespeare’s enduring relevance.
“He gives you life, and anything that gives you life rather than takes it away is always going to be popular,” Dromgoole said in an interview on Friday.
Hamlet, the story of melancholy Danish prince and his doubting quest to avenge a murdered father, captured audiences across the world, said Dromgoole.
“In some places it provokes, in some places it challenges, in some places it consoles, in others it inspires,” he said.

Non-English speaking audiences were provided with synopses and translators, with memorable performances taking place in Somaliland, Dromgoole said, remembering the cast being followed by trucks full of “boys with AK47s”.
They also performed for Syrian refugees at the Zaatari camp in Jordan, where the play was interrupted by a sandstorm, and at the migrant shanty town nicknamed the “Jungle” outside France’s northern port of Calais.

The final performances of the Hamlet world tour will be staged on Sunday in the open-air core of the timbered, curved-walled Globe, a 1990s replica of the famous theater which was burned to the ground in 1613.
Those without a ticket will still be able to celebrate Shakespeare through the film project, named “The Complete Walk”.
It will screen 37 short films, one for each of Shakespeare’s plays, shot in locations from Athens to Vienna where the playwright had set his stories but never visited.
Highlighting Shakespeare’s international appeal, the Complete Walk is also being exported to cities beyond Britain including Madrid, Gdansk and Taipei.
Shakespeare’s birth place Stratford-upon-Avon will also host celebrations and a parade on Saturday and Sunday.",fake
3465,Mick Mulvaney: Don't take Trump 'word for word' on Puerto Rico debt,"One day after President Trump suggested that Puerto Rico's huge debt load could be wiped out, his own budget director walked the comments back.
""I wouldn't take it word for word with that,"" Mick Mulvaney, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, told CNN's ""New Day"" on Wednesday.
The U.S. territory has struggled with a financial crisis for years -- since long before Hurricane Maria devastated the island two weeks ago. A $73 billion debt burden forced Puerto Rico in May to file for the biggest U.S. municipal bankruptcy in history.
On Tuesday, Trump told Fox News' Geraldo Rivera that ""we are going to work something out"" on Puerto Rico's debt.
""They owe a lot of money to your friends on Wall Street,"" the president said in San Juan. ""We will have to wipe that out.""
Related: Speaking on Puerto Rican debt, Trump says 'we will have to wipe that out'
It wasn't clear what Trump had in mind, including whether he was suggesting a government bailout or a restructuring of the island's debt that would impose losses on investors.
On Wednesday, Mulvaney said the burden lies with Puerto Rico.
""This was a very badly mismanaged island for a very long time,"" he said. ""And I think what you saw the president talking about was his acknowledgment that Puerto Rico is going to have to figure out a way to solve that debt problem in order to fix itself going forward.""
Related: 5 facts about Puerto Rico's utter economic misery
As for how: Mulvaney mentioned a law called PROMESA, Spanish for ""promise,"" that Congress passed last year to address Puerto Rico's debt. The law created a financial oversight board to help the island, and it staved off creditor lawsuits for a few months.
A messy legal battle followed anyway. Puerto Rico filed for bankruptcy as PROMESA's lawsuit protection provision ran out earlier this year.
""Those bonds are being dealt with, were being dealt with before the storm, will be dealt with after the storm through the PROMESA process,"" Mulvaney said. ""Our focus will be entirely on rebuilding the island, making sure people are safe, and that Puerto Rico can get back on its feet.""

3208,"Boy Scouts of America to allow girls to join, earn Eagle Scout rank","(Reuters) - In a historic shift, the Boy Scouts of America will let girls enroll in Cub Scouts starting next year and allow them to eventually earn the highest rank of Eagle Scout, the organization said on Wednesday.
The unanimous decision by the 100-year-old group’s board of directors came after years of requests from families and girls, it said, though the announcement prompted a largely negative reaction on social media.
“We believe it is critical to evolve how our programs meet the needs of families interested in positive and lifelong experiences for their children,” Boy Scouts Chief Executive Michael Surbaugh said in a statement.
The Boy Scouts of America (BSA) has lost about a third of its members since 2000, which now stands at 2.3 million. BSA insisted that allowing girls was in response to the needs of families, not related to declining membership.
The Girl Scouts of the USA said girls thrive in a girl-only environment, and that “we are girl experts.”
Starting in 2018, the Boy Scouts will allow girls to join the 7- to 10-year-old Cub Scouts. Small, community-level “dens” will be single-gender. Larger “packs,” which are comprised of dens, will decide whether to include dens of each gender or not, the BSA said.
In a program to be announced next year and projected to start in 2019, girls will follow the same curriculum as the Boy Scouts, which are for ages 11-17.
Surbaugh in a tweet said, “Today, the BSA opens a new chapter in our history w/a unanimous vote to welcome girls to Cub through Eagle Rank.”

After the announcement, the Girl Scouts issued a statement that did not mention the Boy Scouts or its move to include girls.
“Girl Scouts remains committed to and believes strongly in the importance of the all-girl, girl-led and girl-friendly environment that Girl Scouts provides, which creates a necessary safe space for girls to learn and thrive,” the organization said.

In August, a top Girl Scout official accused the Boy Scouts of running a “covert campaign” to recruit girls to increase its declining membership, the Washington Post reported.
The program for girls older than Cub Scouts projected to begin in 2019 will allow them to earn the Eagle Scout rank, the highest achievement in the organization.
On social media, hundreds of people were critical of the news, with many posts echoing the sentiments of Donald Trump Jr., the president’s son.
“Strange, I thought that’s what the Girl Scouts was for???” he said on Twitter.
Sing Oldham, spokesman for the Southern Baptist Convention, said the announcement continued a “reinvention” of the Boy Scouts his group does not support, including the decision in 2013 to allow openly gay members.
In January, the Boy Scouts also opted to allow transgender boys to join.",fake
3051,UAE: Qatar must shun 'extremism' to host 2022 World Cup,"Minister of State for Foreign Affairs for the United Arab Emirates, Anwar Gargash, speaks at an event at Chatham House in London, Britain July 17, 2017. REUTERS/Neil Hall
DUBAI/DOHA (Reuters) - A senior United Arab Emirates official said Qatar’s hosting of the 2022 World Cup should depend on it rejecting “extremism and terrorism”, in comments that drew the soccer tournament into the diplomatic row among rich Gulf monarchies.
Qatar, which denies accusations by the UAE and some other Gulf states that it has links to militants, said in a statement to Reuters that the UAE’s charge was desperate and “weak.”
The UAE, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain severed diplomatic, trade and travel ties with Qatar in June, accusing it of sponsoring hardline Islamist groups, a charge Doha denies. Egypt, the Arab world’s most populous state, have also joined the boycott.
Kuwaiti and U.S. attempts to ease the row have yielded little progress and media outlets backed by the opposing sides have unleashed a war of words that has aggravated tensions in the U.S-allied Gulf.
“Qatar’s hosting of World Cup 2022 should include a repudiation of policies supporting extremism & terrorism. Doha should review its record,” UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash wrote on Twitter.
“Hosting World Cup 2022 should not be tainted by support of extremist individuals & (organizations)/ terrorist figures, review of Qatar’s policies a must,” he added.
The World Cup is the centerpiece of a carefully crafted strategy to project Qatar onto the global stage via sport. In the run-up, Qatar is scheduled to host events across different sports aimed at improving infrastructure and expertise.
“(The) UAE’s demand that Qatar give up the World Cup shows their illegal blockade is founded on petty jealousy, not real concerns,” Qatar’s government communications office said.
“Their weak attempts to tie the hosting of the 2022 FIFA World Cup to their illegal blockade show their desperation to justify their inhumane action,” it added in a statement.
Although the countries boycotting Qatar would not have a direct way of halting the World Cup, they are major powers in regional sport and could interfere with Qatar’s wider plans. Egypt is the top-ranked soccer team in Africa, and Saudi Arabia and the UAE are both in Asia’s top eight.
Last month officials from the states boycotting Qatar did not turn up to the draw for a Middle East soccer tournament in Doha and said they wanted to postpone the competition that could be an early test for the World Cup hosts.
Qatar has previously said that the rift has not affected its preparations to host the tournament and that alternative sources for construction materials had been secured.
Soccer’s governing body FIFA says it has been in regular contact with Qatar since the row erupted.
Gargash made his comments after a former Dubai police chief wrote on Twitter this week that the Gulf crisis could end if Doha forfeited hosting the World Cup. Gargash said the official, Dhahi Khalfan, had been misunderstood in media coverage.",fake
1895,"ISIS Fighters, Having Pledged to Fight or Die, Surrender en Masse","DIBIS, Iraq — The prisoners were taken to a waiting room in groups of four, and were told to stand facing the concrete wall, their noses almost touching it, their hands bound behind their backs.
More than a thousand prisoners determined to be Islamic State fighters passed through that room last week after they fled their crumbling Iraqi stronghold of Hawija. Instead of the martyrdom they had boasted was their only acceptable fate, they had voluntarily ended up here in the interrogation center of the Kurdish authorities in northern Iraq.
For an extremist group that has made its reputation on its ferociousness, with fighters who would always choose suicide over surrender, the fall of Hawija has been a notable turning point. The group has suffered a string of humiliating defeats in Iraq and Syria, but the number of its shock troops who turned themselves in at the center in Dibis was unusually large, more than 1,000 since last Sunday, according to Kurdish intelligence officials.
The fight for Mosul, Iraq’s second-largest city, took nine months, and by comparison, relatively few Islamic State fighters surrendered. Tal Afar fell next, and more quickly, in only 11 days. Some 500 fighters surrendered there.

The Iraqi military ousted the Islamic State, also known as ISIS and ISIL, from Hawija in 15 days, saying it had taken its forces only three days of actual heavy fighting before most of the extremists grabbed their families and ran. According to Kurdish officials, they put up no fight at all, other than planting bombs and booby traps.",fake
3971,"Hillary Clinton, Obamas condemn Harvey Weinstein","Washington (CNN) Hillary Clinton and former President Barack Obama condemned disgraced Hollywood executive Harvey Weinstein on Tuesday, marking their first public comments on the matter since reports of his alleged predatory behavior broke five days ago.
""I was shocked and appalled by the revelations about Harvey Weinstein,"" Clinton said in a statement through her spokesman Nick Merrill. ""The behavior described by women coming forward cannot be tolerated. Their courage and the support of others is critical in helping to stop this kind of behavior.""
A statement from Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama on Tuesday evening similarly expressed disgust at Weinstein's reported actions and praised those who came forward.
""Michelle and I have been disgusted by the recent reports about Harvey Weinstein,"" the statement said. ""Any man who demeans and degrades women in such fashion needs to be condemned and held accountable, regardless of wealth or status. We should celebrate the courage of women who have come forward to tell these painful stories. And we all need to build a culture -- including by empowering our girls and teaching our boys decency and respect -- so we can make such behavior less prevalent in the future.""
Both statements made no mention of Weinstein's sizable donations to the Clinton and Obama war chests.
Shortly after the Obamas' announcement, Democratic leadership disavowed Weinstein as well.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from Weinstein's home state of New York, said on Twitter Tuesday evening he was sending donations from Weinstein to charities based in the state.
""What Mr. Weinstein did was awful. Sending his donations to NY orgs doing crucial work for survivors & fams, @SafeHorizon @sffny & @cvtcnyc,"" Schumer tweeted.
What Mr. Weinstein did was awful. Sending his donations to NY orgs doing crucial work for survivors & fams, @SafeHorizon @sffny & @cvtcnyc. — Chuck Schumer (@SenSchumer) October 10, 2017
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi issued a statement calling on accountability for ""every man who disrespects and attacks women.""
""The news of Harvey Weinstein's countless assaults on women and the clear efforts to intimidate his victims into silence are shocking,"" Pelosi's statement read. ""His despicable actions violate every standard of acceptable behavior.""
Weinstein is a longtime associate of the Clintons and a major Democratic Party donor who bundled funds for the party's political campaigns, including supporting both of Clinton's presidential bids. Weinstein was also a bundler -- someone who gathers donations from others into large sums -- for the Obama-Biden 2012 effort.
The allegations against Weinstein have renewed a debate about sexual harassment in the workplace and drawn attention to Clinton, the Democrats' 2016 standard-bearer who made the treatment of women a key plank of her presidential campaign.
Representatives for the former secretary of state and former President Bill Clinton had previously not responded to requests for comment about Weinstein, whose ties to the Clintons go back years, from the Clinton presidency to the former first lady's successful campaign for Senate.
Clinton spoke in California Monday night as part of her book tour and did not address the allegations, nor was she asked about them during the 90-minute event.
The office of former Vice President Joe Biden declined to comment.
Democrats disavow
Many Democratic office-holders quickly repudiated Weinstein, with some going so far as to send donations given by Weinstein to charity.
Clinton's former running mate, Virginia Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine, said on CNN Tuesday morning that people should condemn Weinstein and said he anticipated Clinton would say something eventually.
Kaine noted Clinton has spoken out about sexual harassment often. During the campaign, Clinton spoke out about the issue and went after President Donald Trump over the allegations of sexual assault against him. Trump pushed back by touting similar allegations against her husband, former President Bill Clinton.
Early in the campaign, the former secretary of state was asked about some of those accusations and her own assertions that victims who allege assault should be believed. In the context of allegations against her husband, Clinton said, ""I would say that everyone should be believed at first until they are disbelieved based on evidence.""
Clinton's condemnation Tuesday came after years of links between the Clintons, Weinstein and the Democratic Party.
In 2015, the Clintons rented a home next to Weinstein in the Hamptons, and Weinstein served as a connector between Hollywood stars and Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign.
Weinstein raised about $1.5 million from 1990-2016, according to data from the campaign finance-tracking Center for Responsive Politics, and was involved in fundraisers for Clinton's effort, some of which she headlined.
Prior to Tuesday's announcement, longtime Hillary Clinton aides were confused by the former secretary of state's silence on the issue, questioning -- in private -- why she had not weighed in at all.
The Obamas' ties with Weinstein were significant as well. Besides supporting Obama's 2012 presidential bid as a bundler and maintaining his role in the Democratic Party, Weinstein appeared at the White House several times for formal and informal events, and the Obamas' eldest daughter, Malia, interned at the Weinstein Company.
At a White House event for student films in 2013, first lady Michelle Obama credited Weinstein for making the event happen and praised him as a wonderful person and a good friend, and Weinstein was one of many guests at a star-studded White House birthday party for Obama in 2016.
Like Clinton, the Obamas have repeatedly addressed and condemned sexual harassment and assault.
Michelle Obama delivered a scathing speech last October, attacking Trump for having ""bragged about sexually assaulting women,"" in reference to the infamous Access Hollywood tape.
Bombshell allegations
A bombshell report in The New York Times detailed decades of sexual harassment by Weinstein, and just three days after its publication, Weinstein was fired by the company he founded.
On Tuesday, The New Yorker published a major story in which several women alleged sexual assault by Weinstein. Through his representative, Sallie Hofmeister, Weinstein denied ""any allegations of non-consensual sex.""
The reports have put Democrats under pressure to disavow Weinstein and return or donate contributions from him to charity.
Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, for example, said in a CNN interview on Sunday that Democrats should give any money they received from Weinstein back.",fake

""I just want to make it more emotional,"" he tells CNN, explaining it takes at least 30 seconds and he's limited to 20 photos in a shoot.
""Across Formula One there are so many guys just shooting news -- what happened in the race or who won the qualifying -- but that is arbitrary to my project.

You'd be hard-pushed to find a greater contrast between a camera and its subject.
Before making the transition to F1, Paul used his 104-year-old device to shoot firefighters coming out of the rubble of Ground Zero for the New York Times, in the aftermath of 9/11.
Now he spends his day capturing the world's fastest drivers, following the likes of Lewis Hamilton around the world.
""I was inspired to pick up the camera again ahead of the 2014 Monaco Grand Prix,"" Paul explains, singling out the street circuit as his favorite race on the calendar for its accessibility and atmosphere.
""Most of the images I got from that shoot were blurry, out of focus and didn't quite work.
""I think I've taken the camera to maybe 30-40 races around the world in the last four years, and now it's coming together.
""I'm really used to it, I'm anticipating the focus and it's more like an extension of my body.""
Nobody captures Formula One races quite like American photographer Joshua Paul.
The photographer has to be proactive, anticipating a situation before it has occurred.
While he accepts it can be frustrating to forgo many of the shots a modern day camera could obtain, he's gradually catching the eye of F1's leading stars.
Paul regularly gives out prints of his favorite images to the drivers, mechanics and team principals he depicts -- something he says other photographers simply don't have time for.
""A lot of the guys are like 'Nobody's ever given me anything before!'"" he laughs. ""I just say 'Thanks for letting me walk into your garages and pit lanes.'""
""I try to let the drivers know I'm trying to do something different and often they'll indicate they like what I'm doing,"" Paul adds. ""It could just be a nod or gesture, but it means a lot to me.
""It takes years for a team to say yes to a portrait, so I just thought: 'Let's take beautiful pictures that might appeal to someone that's not necessarily a racing fan, but who might then take an interest and see [F1] through childhood eyes.
F1 cars to cameras
Having grown up fixated by the ""magic"" of F1, the photographer will never forget the moment he first felt truly embraced by the sport.
""The camera broke in 2015 during my second season when I was in Budapest,"" Paul recalls. ""One of the Lotus mechanics asked to see the camera and I said 'sorry it's broken.'
""He said 'Oh bring it in, we'll fix it.'
""The Lotus mechanics took the camera apart and we found all sorts of different pieces, tapes and screws, and we basically rebuilt the camera.
""In the meantime, Pastor Maldonado had crashed his car in one of the pre-practice sessions so it came in damaged and basically had to be completely rebuilt for the next morning session.
""But for about 30 minutes the Lotus guys and I hung out and talked about the shutter curtain and what it's made of, what the best tape it would be for it, and then he took some out...
""It's been working ever since!""
'Romanticizing the sport'
Midway through Paul's fourth season in F1, his project is gathering pace.
The photographer now produces an expansive, award-winning magazine called Lollipop that takes a behind-the-scenes look at who's who in F1.
For him, it's all about ""romanticizing"" the sport, making it ""more about the people than just the cars and the racing.""
""Some people don't get what I'm doing,"" he says, ""but it's not about perfection. It's about what might make you smile.""

1630,How do you start a country?,"Image copyright Getty Images
On 1 October, Catalonia held an unofficial vote to determine whether or not the region should break away from Spain to become an independent state.
It is not the first time that such a region has sought independence.
But what things do you need to become an independent state?
BBC World Service's The Inquiry has looked into how it might work.
Image copyright Getty Images
The four characteristics
""You can't be a real country unless you have a beer and an airline."" So said the rock musician Frank Zappa.
But actually, international law experts are much more likely to identify four main facets of a state: a people, a territory, a government, and the ability to conduct relations with other states on a sovereign basis.
The definition of a people is much disputed, but some might argue that it means a permanent population with a concept of, and belief in, their own nationality.
As James Irving, who teaches international law at the London School of Economics (LSE), puts it: ""Are there... ties, effective ties, ties of belonging, of identity of feeling.""
""And also, ties relating to those of practical shared interest.""
Another essential is that states should have a defined territory, an area within borders, in which it is sovereign.
Stable and effective government is another criterion of statehood cited by many.
The ability to conduct relations with other states is another key element.
So sovereign states are free to enter into relations which are bilateral - where, for example, two countries agree to diplomatic relations or work together to solve a common problem - or multilateral - as part of the EU, for instance, or as signatories to international climate change agreements.
Underlying this is the understanding that a sovereign state is neither dependent on, nor subjected to, any other power or state.
So how do would-be states become true states?
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Recognition as a sovereign state by the United Nations is the ultimate prize
Recognition
Individual countries can recognise each other, but the big prize is recognition as a state by the United Nations.
The benefits are legion: The protection of international law; access to loans from the World Bank and the IMF; control over borders and greater access to economic networks; and mechanisms.
Plus the protection afforded by trade laws, making it easier to create trade agreements.
But can you be unrecognised by the UN and still be a state?
""Essentially, it's the old adage: if it walks like a duck and talks like a duck, it is a duck,"" explains Rebecca Richards, a lecturer in International Relations at Keele University.
""We recognise that it is state-like, it's just lacking that recognition.""

Somaliland is a case in point.
A former British protectorate in East Africa, it was independent for four days in 1960, before it joined up with Italian Somalia.
It remained part of Somalia until the government there collapsed in 1991.
Then Somaliland unilaterally declared independence.
""There's a remarkably strong government,"" explains Rebecca Richards.
""It's had a series of democratic elections. It's peaceful. It's stable. There's an incredible amount of economic development that's taking place. It's pretty much everything that you would expect to see in a state,"" Dr Richards adds.
But Somaliland is not recognised by anybody, making life hard.
""There is limited access to some types of developmental assistance or humanitarian assistance, but a lot of that, especially… aid that comes from the UN… goes through Somalia.""
Access to international markets is difficult without legal protections.
As Somaliland's currency is not recognised outside its boundaries, it has no international value.
Legal barriers
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption US President Harry S Truman examining the United Nations Charter in Washington in 1945
The concept which underlies the idea of a nation state is ""self-determination"".
The Oxford English Dictionary defines it as: ""The action of a people in deciding its own form of government; free determination of statehood, postulated as a right.""
This right was enshrined in the UN Charter in June 1945.
Self-determination was initially seen as a way for peoples living under colonial regimes to gain independence, or choose some form of association with the former colonial power or another state.
""A lot of people thought it sounded like a good idea,"" explains Dr Irving, ""but there wasn't a great deal of agreement on what it meant.""
If the people of a colonised territory wanted their own country, the principle of self-determination suggested they should have it.
About a third of the planet's population saw its political status changed.
From just 51 countries in 1945, the United Nations today has 193 members.
But there was a catch.
Many jurists of international law maintained that after a colony gained independence, further separations, or consideration of changes in borders, were out.
But this runs up against the idea of self-determination.
""How do you marry those two principles, that borders can't change and yet people should have a right to determine their own future?"" asks James Ker-Lindsay, senior research fellow in South East European Politics at the LSE.
Autonomy
Image copyright AFP Image caption Kosovo took part in the 2016 Olympics, but does not have full international recognition
The solution was to say that, for people living inside the borders of the country from which they want independence, self-determination gives a right to autonomy, but stops short of being allowed their own country.
This issue came to the fore in Kosovo.
When Yugoslavia broke up, it was replaced by six republics, one of which was Serbia.
Kosovo was a province within Serbia's borders, but with a different ethnic population which had enjoyed a large degree of autonomy.
Kosovo becoming independent would have changed the borders of Serbia and violated the principle of territorial integrity.
""The international community's first response was to say [Kosovo] should have a right of internal self-determination,"" says Dr Ker-Lindsay.
""[That] this is a province of Serbia but they don't have the same right to independence that the other republics had.
""So once [the Kosovans] realised that they weren't going to get independence through peaceful means, they launched an uprising,"" he adds.
A conflict with the Serbian authorities followed, which only ended with Nato military intervention in 1999.
Then in 2008, Kosovo unilaterally declared independence.
Serbia said this was invalid and took the issue to the court of the United Nations that settles international legal disputes - the International Court of Justice.
""The question put before it was, was Kosovo's declaration of independence in contravention of general international law?"" says Dr Ker-Lindsay.
""And the court actually said there's nothing under international law that says a territory can't declare independence.""
But the crux of the matter was less a question of law and more whether Kosovan statehood was likely to be recognised.
""Kosovo has been recognised by more than half of the UN members,"" says Dr Richards, ""but it's still not recognised as a sovereign state because the UN, as a body, does not recognise it as a sovereign state.""
And some recognition means Kosovo enjoys some of the benefits of being a state such as access to the World Bank, the IMF, and the International Olympic Committee.

Powerful friends
""It's essentially impossible for a group to become independent and claim its own statehood unless others, other powerful states, are willing to support it,"" says Milena Sterio, a professor at Cleveland State University in the US, where she teaches international law.
So what does it take to get the great powers to back you?
East Timor was a Portuguese colony until the 1960s, when it was invaded by Indonesia.
The Indonesians were a valuable US ally during the Cold War, so the East Timorese independence movement received little support.
It wasn't until after the Cold War, in the 1990s, when international attention turned to East Timor again and the western great powers no longer needed Indonesia as an ally because communism had fallen.
""The western great powers, essentially embarrassed by the human rights violations that were taking place in East Timor, backed off and essentially said, 'OK, now you the people of East Timor, you get to exercise this delayed right to self-determination,'"" say Prof Sterio.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Catalonia has a highly active independence movement
In 1999 the Timorese voted for independence, which they got in 2002.
But the process was marred by violence, and needed political support from the UN and the intervention of international peace-keepers.
The situation in Spain is very different.
Under current principles of international law, the Catalans have a right to self-determination, but many jurists would argue that all they can hope for is autonomy, not independence, because of Spain's right to maintain its territorial integrity.
So what happens with a vote in favour independence?
""I really foresee a negotiated solution where Catalonia remains in Spain with perhaps a heightened degree of autonomy,"" says Prof Sterio.
""What's really interesting is that Spain is one of the Western democracies that has actually not recognised Kosovo as an independent state because Spain is afraid of establishing this independence-seeking precedent because of Catalonia threatening the territorial integrity of Spain.""
And although the situation of the Kurds is very different, ultimately they will run up against the same problem - a lack of great power support.

2072,"In Chad, refugees on aid pittance turn to knitting and hairdressing","DIBA 1, Chad (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - When armed gunmen stormed Ashta Sahade’s hometown of Bocaranga in Central African Republic, the only possession she grabbed as she fled was her unwieldy rectangular knitting machine.
During the two-day journey to safety in nearby Chad, on foot and on the back of a stranger’s bicycle, single mother Sahade, 27, carried the machine precariously on her head, convinced it was the key to her and her three-year-old’s survival.
In the village of Diba 1 in southern Chad, she was proven right. Not only does she make knitted goods to sell, she also teaches local Chadian women to do the same in a bid to boost her income.
She is not alone. In the past year, the population of Diba has more than doubled as a spike in violence in Central African Republic sends more refugees across the border. On the main road, dozens of new arrivals have set up makeshift trading stalls within days of escaping the conflict back home.
They sell everything from fresh beef cuts and tailored trousers to glossy hair extensions and beauty treatments.
LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION
Key to the refugees’ ability to get by, along with their entrepreneurship, is their location. They live not in isolated camps, where residents often struggle to find enough money to meet their needs, but in the midst of a Chadian village, where basic infrastructure is already in place and locals are among their main customers.
Most build their own homes from tree branches and straw.
“The idea is that it is better for refugees to settle in host communities rather than putting them in a camp where opportunities, including mixing with the locals, can be limited,” said Ibrahima Diane, a public information officer with the U.N. refugee agency (UNHCR) in Chad.
This new approach by international aid agencies in southern Chad is also being rolled out in the east for refugees from Sudan, as well as in other parts of Africa.
It benefits villagers too as the infrastructure set up in host communities by the agencies, including wells, clinics and schools, can be used by everyone.
Today, close to 10,400 refugees from Central African Republic live across 23 villages in southern Chad, while about 60,500 others are housed in six refugee camps.
In Diba, Chadian couple Aimé Eri-Ada and Catherine Yawa Gom are waiting to see the nurse at the village’s new health post with their baby who has malaria. “He was vomiting. I brought him here urgently,” said Eri-Ada.
Before, the family had to walk 8 km (5 miles)to get medical treatment. The area has no paved roads and its muddy paths often turn into swamps in the rainy season. Travelers dodge snakes and mosquitoes, hitching rides on overloaded trucks.
But with five children, trips to the doctor are unavoidable. “There are many problems of malaria, diarrhea and so on,” said Eri-Ada. “Now we can come here - and it’s free.”
18 CENTS A DAY
Yet resources are stretched to breaking point. At the clinic, refugees and locals complain there often isn’t enough medication – and that is just the tip of the iceberg.
Refugees, some of whom arrived a few days ago, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation they barely receive any food rations.
Sahade is entitled to aid of 3,000 Central African francs ($5.38) each month in cash or food vouchers - the equivalent of about 18 cents a day. Yet the last time this paltry allowance materialized was five months ago, she said.
“My biggest problems are the lack of food, the lack of money - and having enough strength to keep on working,” she said, breastfeeding her two-week-old baby.
Spillover from the conflict in Central African Republic - which has produced at least seven waves of refugees since 2003 fueled by impunity, marauding gangs and illegal diamond trading - is largely forgotten in a part of the world most people would struggle to pinpoint on a map.
Between 2014 and 2017, 34 out of 57 aid agencies working in southern Chad pulled out due to a lack of funding, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.
So far this year, only about a third of the $588.6 million requested by a U.N.-backed appeal to fund humanitarian response in Chad for 2017 has been donated.
The World Food Program says landlocked, arid Chad faces a critical shortfall in food supply, while the 2016 Global Hunger Index places it second last out of 117 countries.
Inadequate food rations are linked to many other problems, including malnutrition, early marriage, domestic violence, and women and children having sex to survive, aid workers and refugees say.
“There are many orphans, children separated from their families, unaccompanied minors – many of them haven’t been to school for two years. We need support,” said Idriss Dairou, president of the refugees’ association in Diba.
The situation is compounded by Chad’s own problems. The 2016 Human Development Index ranks it as the world’s third least-developed country after Central African Republic and Niger.
Of its 14.2 million people, almost half live below the poverty line. Yet it is also the African country that takes in the biggest number of refugees proportionate to its population, according to the United Nations.
BUSINESS PARTNERS
Given the low level of aid, refugees in Diba want international partners to help them with farming, animal-rearing and other activities, Dairou said. “This way we can try and work ourselves in order to have enough to eat,” he said.
The international humanitarian arm of the Lutheran World Federation (LWF) has set up centers in camps to train mixed groups of refugees and locals in skills such as carpentry, mechanics, tailoring, woodwork and IT.
Among the 57 apprentices in Dosseye camp, 35 are from Central African Republic and 22 from Chad. On graduating, many hope to set up businesses together.
Some are already making this a reality. In downtown Goré, a city about 170 km from Diba, refugee Atom Al-Kabboro and Chadian Mahamat Abakar run a hairdressing salon. “La Main Sûre” (A Trusty Hand), set up with LWF funding, caters to both Chadians and refugees and is popular with the aid community.
But back in Diba, the future is clouded by uncertainty as more refugees arrive.
Village chief Jacques Marboua worries that without more aid, there will be grave problems on the horizon. The refugees’ monthly allowance, when it comes through, “is not enough at all”, he said, shaking his head.
Living alongside locals, their fortunes are intertwined, he added. “If (the refugees) don’t have enough to eat, they will go and steal from our fields,” he said.
“If they get sick, we’ll also get sick. We share the same wells, we work together, we drink bili-bili (local beer) together.”
“We’ve welcomed them with open arms,” he said. “But now we’re afraid for our future.”",fake
